  My father and mother were Irish
    And I am Irish too;
  I bought a wee fidil for ninepence
    And that is Irish too;
  I'm up in the morning early
    To meet the break of day,
  And to the lintwhite's piping
    The many's the tunes I play!
  One pleasant eve in June-time
    I met a lochrie man,
  His face and hands were weazen,
    His height was not a span.
  He boor'd me for my fidil--
    "You know," says he, "like you,
  "My father and mother were Irish,
    "And I am Irish too!"
  He took my wee red fidil,
    And such a tune he turned,
  The Glaise in it whispered
    The Lionan in it m'urned;
  Says he, "My lad, you're lucky,
    "I wisht I was like you,
  "You're lucky in your birth-star,
    "And in your fidil too!"
  He gave me back my fidil,
    My fidil-stick also,
  And stepping like a May-boy,
    He jumped the Lear-gaidh-knowe.
  I never saw him after,
    Nor met his gentle kind,
  But whiles I think I hear him,
    A-wheening in the wind!
