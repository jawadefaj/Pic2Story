_Mor of Cloyne, a Munster Princess, is singing at the door of a Fairy
Rath to her sister, a captive within it, the magic tune by which she
once escaped from a like captivity._

  Little Sister, whom the Fay
    Hides away within his doon,
  Deep below yon seeding fern,
    Oh, list and learn my magic tune.
  Long ago, when snared like thee
    By the Shee, my harp and I
  O'er them wove the slumber spell,
    Warbling well its lullaby.
  Till with dreamy smiles they sank,
    Rank on rank, before the strain;
  And I rose from out the rath,
    And found my path to earth again.
  Little Sister, to my woe
    Hid below among the Shee,
  List and learn the magic tune,
    That it full soon may succour thee.
