  Now, all the night around their echoing camp
  Was heard continuous from the hills a sound as of the tramp
  Of giant footsteps; but, so thick the white mist lay around,
  None saw the Walker, save the King. He, starting at the sound,
  Called to his foot his fierce red hound; athwart his shoulders cast
  A shaggy mantle, grasped his spear, and through the moonlight passed
  Alone up dark Ben-Boli's heights, towards which, above the woods,
  With sound as when at close of eve the noise of falling floods
  Is borne to shepherd's ear remote on stilly upland lawn,
  The steps along the mountain-side with hollow fall came on.
  Fast beat the hero's heart; and close down-crouching by his knee
  Trembled the hound, while, through the haze, huge as through mists at
      sea,
  The week-long sleepless mariner descries some mountain cape,
  Wreck-infamous, rise on his lee, appeared a monstrous Shape,
  Striding impatient, like a man much grieved, who walks alone,
  Considering of a cruel wrong; down from his shoulders thrown
  A mantle, skirted stiff with soil splashed from the miry ground,
  At every stride against his calves struck with as loud rebound
  As makes the main-sail of a ship brought up along the blast,
  When with the coil of all its ropes it beats the sounding mast.
  So, striding vast, the giant passed; the King held fast his breath--
  Motionless, save his throbbing heart; and chill and still as death
  Stood listening while, a second time, the giant took the round
  Of all the camp; but, when at length, for the third time, the sound
  Came up, and through the parting haze a third time huge and dim
  Rose out the Shape, the valiant hound sprang forth and challenged him.
  And forth, disdaining that a dog should put him so to shame,
  Sprang Congal, and essayed to speak: "Dread Shadow, stand! Proclaim
  What wouldst thou that thou thus all night around my camp shouldst keep
  Thy troublous vigil banishing the wholesome gift of sleep
  From all our eyes, who, though inured to dreadful sounds and sights
  By land and sea, have never yet, in all our perilous nights,
  Lain in the ward of such a guard."
                                The Shape made answer none,
  But with stern wafture of its hand went angrier striding on,
  Shaking the earth with heavier steps. Then Congal on his track
  Sprang fearless.
    "Answer me, thou churl!" he cried, "I bid thee back!"
  But while he spoke, the giant's cloak around his shoulders grew
  Like to a black-bulged thunder-cloud, and sudden, out there flew
  From all its angry swelling folds, with uproar unconfined,
  Direct against the King's pursuit, a mighty blast of wind.
  Loud flapped the mantle, tempest-lined, while, fluttering down the gale,
  As leaves in autumn, man and hound were swept into the vale;
  And, heard o'er all the huge uproar, through startled Dalaray
  The giant went, with stamp and clash, departing south away.
