  'Three women were transformed into flowers which grew in the field, but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night  Then once when day was drawing near, and she was forced to go back to her companions in the field and become a flower again, she said to her husband, if you will come this afternoon and gather me, I shall be set free and henceforth stay with you  And he did so  Now the question is, how did her husband know her, for the flowers were exactly alike, and without any difference  Answer - as she was at her home during the night and not in the field, no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this her husband knew her    There was not in the whole city of Bagdad a greedier man than Abi Fressah, and you may be sure he was not popular  It was not that he was rich and refused to give heed to the needs of the poor  He was, in truth, a merchant in moderately affluent circumstances, and he did not withhold charity from the deserving; but he was a man of enormous appetite and did not scruple to descend to trickery to secure an invitation to a meal  So skilful, indeed, did he become in wheedling these favors from his friends and from those with whom he traded, that he devoted the major portion of each day to feeding and left himself little time to attend to his business affairs  Moreover, he grew unpleasantly fat  His face was red and bloated with much wine drinking  He was not a nice person to look upon at all, and those who had aforetime been his friends came to the conclusion that the day had arrived when he should be taught a severe lesson  And so it came to pass that when Abi Fressah was standing in the bazaar at the hour of the mid-day meal and eagerly scanning the crowd to discover some acquaintance whom he could induce to ask him to dinner, he saw Ben Maslia, one of the wealthiest and most generous of men in Bagdad  "Ah, my excellent friend," Abi cried, warmly greeting Ben Maslia, "\'tis almost an eternity since my unworthy eyes were cast upon thy pleasant countenance  Peace be on thee and thine unto the end of days " "Also to thee," returned Ben Maslia  "And whence comest thou? And whither goest thou, oh most hospitable friend?" Abi Fressah asked these questions hastily, his beady eyes searching the other\'s face hungrily for a sign upon which he could seize to invite himself to a meal  "It is the hour of the mid-day meal  Goest thou, perchance, to thy pious home?" "Thither go I," said Ben Maslia  "My path lies in the same direction," said Abi Fressah  "It will be pleasant to walk together  Come," and he grasped Ben Maslia by the arm  "It is kind of thee, friend Abi Fressah," rejoined the other, "but I have built me a new abode on the other side of the city " Abi Fressah\'s face fell for a moment, but he was clever enough to take advantage of the news  "A new dwelling erected by the wealthy Ben Maslia," he said, winningly, "must be a building of magnificence, worth seeing " "Indeed it is as thou sayest," cried the other enthusiastically, and forthwith he launched into a lavish description of his residence  Abi Fressah grew impatient when Ben Maslia began to describe each room in detail, his hunger increased when, in glowing words, his friend painted the gorgeous dining-room, and his mouth watered at the information that the cellars were stocked with a thousand bottles of wine  "Blessings on thee and thy wine-cellar and thy house," murmured Abi Fressah, when he could get in a word  "I have no business of consequence to transact this afternoon  I could not pay thee a better compliment than to spend it examining thy treasures " "Of a certainty thou couldst not," assented the other, to his great glee  "Then let us proceed," said Abi Fressah  So they set out, Ben Maslia still continuing his glowing account of his wonderful house  "It must be as spacious as a palace," put in Abi Fressah  "Thou speakest truth," agreed Ben Maslia  Sometimes in spring, when the big river flooded its banks and made lakes of the meadows, and the little rivers flowed deep, old Peter spent a few days netting fish  Also in summer he set night-lines in the little river not far from where it left the forest  And so it happened that one day he sat in the warm sunshine outside his hut, mending his nets and making floats for them; not cork floats like ours, but little rolls of the silver bark of the birch tree  And while he sat there Vanya and Maroosia watched him, and sometimes even helped, holding a piece of the net between them, while old Peter fastened on the little glistening rolls of bark that were to keep it up in the water  And all the time old Peter worked he smoked, and told them stories about fish  First he told them what happened when the first pike was born, and how it is that all the little fish are not eaten by the great pike with his huge greedy mouth and his sharp teeth', "                   On the night of Ivanov's Day (that is the day of Saint John, which is Midsummer) there was born the pike, a huge fish, with such teeth as never were", ' And when the pike was born the waters of the river foamed and raged, so that the ships in the river were all but swamped, and the pretty young girls who were playing on the banks ran away as fast as they could, frightened, they were, by the roaring of the waves, and the black wind and the white foam on the water  Terrible was the birth of the sharp-toothed pike  And when the pike was born he did not grow up by months or by days, but by hours  Every day it was two inches longer than the day before  In a month it was two yards long; in two months it was twelve feet long; in three months it was raging up and down the river like a tempest, eating the bream and the perch, and all the small fish that came in its way  There was a bream or a perch swimming lazily in the stream', " The pike saw it as it raged by, caught it in its great white mouth, and instantly the bream or the perch was gone, torn to pieces by the pike's teeth, and swallowed as you would swallow a sunflower seed", ' And bream and perch are big fish  It was worse for the little ones   Illustration: "Head in air and tail in sea,       Fish, fish, listen to me"  What was to be done? The bream and the perch put their heads together in a quiet pool  It was clear enough that the great pike would eat everyone of them  So they called a meeting of all the little fish, and set to thinking what could be done by way of dealing with the great pike, which had such sharp teeth and was making so free with their lives  They all came to the meeting--bream, and perch, and roach, and dace, and gudgeon; yes, and the little ersh with his spiny back  The silly roach said, "Let us kill the pike " But the gudgeon looked at him with his great eyes, and asked, "Have you got good teeth?" "No," says the roach, "I haven\'t any teeth " "You\'d swallow the pike, I suppose?" says the perch  "My mouth is too small " "Then do not use it to talk foolishness," said the gudgeon; and the roach\'s fins blushed scarlet, and are red to this day  "I will set my prickles on end," says the perch, who has a row of sharp prickles in the fin on his back  "The pike won\'t find them too comfortable in his throat " "Yes," said the bream; "but you will have to go into his throat to put them there, and he\'ll swallow you all the same  Besides, we have not all got prickles " There was a lot more foolishness talked  A long, long way off, right away in the west of America, there once lived an old man who had one son  The country round was covered with forests, in which dwelt all kinds of wild beasts, and the young man and his companions used to spend whole days in hunting them, and he was the finest hunter of all the tribe  One morning, when winter was coming on, the youth and his companions set off as usual to bring back some of the mountain goats and deer to be salted down, as he was afraid of a snow-storm; and if the wind blew and the snow drifted the forest might be impassable for some weeks  The old man and the wife, however, would not go out, but remained in the wigwam making bows and arrows  It soon grew so cold in the forest that at last one of the men declared they could walk no more, unless they could manage to warm themselves', " 'That is easily done,' said the leader, giving a kick to a large tree", ' Flames broke out in the trunk, and before it had burnt up they were as hot as if it had been summer  Then they started off to the place where the goats and deer were to be found in the greatest numbers, and soon had killed as many as they wanted  But the leader killed most, as he was the best shot', " 'Now we must cut up the game and divide it,' said he; and so they did, each one taking his own share; and, walking one behind the other, set out for the village", ' But when they reached a great river the young man did not want the trouble of carrying his pack any further, and left it on the bank', " 'I am going home another way,' he told his companions", ' And taking another road he reached the village long before they did', " 'Have you returned with empty hands?' asked the old man, as his son opened the door", " 'Have I ever done that, that you put me such a question?' asked the youth", " 'No; I have slain enough to feast us for many moons, but it was heavy, and I left the pack on the bank of the great river", " Give me the arrows, I will finish making them, and you can go to the river and bring home the pack!' So the old man rose and went, and strapped the meat on his shoulder; but as he was crossing the ford the strap broke and the pack fell into the river", ' He stooped to catch it, but it swirled past him  He clutched again; but in doing so he over- balanced himself and was hurried into some rapids, where he was knocked against some rocks, and he sank and was drowned, and his body was carried down the stream into smoother water when it rose to the surface again  But by this time it had lost all likeness to a man, and was changed into a piece of wood  The wood floated on, and the river got bigger and bigger and entered a new country', " There it was borne by the current close to the shore, and a woman who was down there washing her clothes caught it as it passed, and drew it out, saying to herself: 'What a nice smooth plank! I will use it as a table to put my food upon", "' And gathering up her clothes she took the plank with her into her hut", ' When her supper time came she stretched the board across two strings which hung from the roof, and set upon it the pot containing a stew that smelt very good  The woman had been working hard all day and was very hungry, so she took her biggest spoon and plunged it into the pot', " But what was her astonishment and disgust when both pot and food vanished instantly before her! 'Oh, you horrid plank, you have brought me ill-luck!' she cried", ' And taking it up she flung it away from her  The woman had been surprised before at the disappearance of her food, but she was more astonished still when, instead of the plank, she beheld a baby  However, she was fond of children and had none of her own, so she made up her mind that she would keep it and take care of it  The baby grew and throve as no baby in that country had ever done, and in four days he was a man, and as tall and strong as any brave of the tribe  Long ago a poor widow woman lived down by the iron forge near Enniscorthy, and she was so poor, she had no clothes to put on her son; so she used to fix him in the ash-hole, near the fire, and pile the warm ashes about him; and, accordingly, as he grew up, she sunk the pit deeper  At last, by hook or by crook, she got a goat-skin, and fastened it round his waist, and he felt quite grand, and took a walk down the street  So says she to him next morning, "Tom, you thief, you never done any good yet, and six-foot high, and past nineteen: take that rope and bring me a _bresna_ from the wood " "Never say\'t twice, mother," says Tom; "here goes " When he had it gathered and tied, what should come up but a big _joiant_, nine-foot high, and made a lick of a club at him  Well become Tom, he jumped a-one side and picked up a ram-pike; and the first crack he gave the big fellow he made him kiss the clod  "If you have e\'er a prayer," says Tom, "now\'s the time to say it, before I make _brishe_ of you " "I have no prayers," says the giant, "but if you spare my life I\'ll give you that club; and as long as you keep from sin you\'ll win every battle you ever fight with it " Tom made no bones about letting him off; and as soon as he got the club in his hands he sat down on the bresna and gave it a tap with the kippeen, and says, "Bresna, I had a great trouble gathering you, and run the risk of my life for you; the least you can do is to carry me home " And, sure enough, the wind of the word was all it wanted', " It went off through the wood, groaning and cracking till it came to the widow's door", ' Well, when the sticks were all burned Tom was sent off again to pick more; and this time he had to fight with a giant with two heads on him', " Tom had a little more trouble with him--that's all; and the prayers _he_ said was to give Tom a fife that nobody could help dancing when he was playing it", ' _Begonies_, he made the big faggot dance home, with himself sitting on it', " Well, if you were to count all the steps from this to Dublin, dickens a bit you'd ever arrive there", ' The next giant was a beautiful boy with three heads on him', " He had neither prayers nor catechism no more _nor_ the others; and so he gave Tom a bottle of green ointment that wouldn't let you be burned, nor scalded, nor wounded", ' "And now," says he, "there\'s no more of us  You may come and gather sticks here till little _Lunacy Day_ in harvest without giant or fairy man to disturb you " Well, now, Tom was prouder nor ten paycocks, and used to take a walk down street in the heel of the evening; but some of the little boys had no more manners nor if they were Dublin jackeens, and put out their tongues at Tom\'s club and Tom\'s goat-skin', " He didn't like that at all, and it would be mean to give one of them a clout", " At last, what should come through the town but a kind of bellman, only it's a big bugle he had, and a huntsman's cap on his head, and a kind of painted shirt", " So this--he wasn't a bellman, and I don't know what to call him--bugleman, maybe--proclaimed that the King of Dublin's daughter was so melancholy that she didn't give a laugh for seven years, and that her father would grant her in marriage to whoever would make her laugh three times", ' "That\'s the very thing for me to try," says Tom; and so, without burning any more daylight, he kissed his mother, curled his club at the little boys, and he set off along the yalla highroad to the town of Dublin  At last Tom came to one of the city gates, and the guards laughed and cursed at him instead of letting him through  Tom stood it all for a little time, but at last one of them--out of fun, as he said--drove his _bagnet_ half an inch or so into his side  Tom did nothing but take the fellow by the scruff of his neck and the waistband of his corduroys and fling him into the canal  Some ran to pull the fellow out, and others to let manners into the vulgarian with their swords and daggers; but a tap from his club sent them headlong into the moat or down on the stones, and they were soon begging him to stay his hands  So at last one of them was glad enough to show Tom the way to the palace yard; and there was the King and the Queen, and the princess in a gallery, looking at all sorts of wrestling and sword-playing, and _rinka-fadhas_ (long dances) and mumming, all to please the princess; but not a smile came over her handsome face', " Well, they all stopped when they seen the young giant, with his boy's face and long black hair, and his short curly beard--for his poor mother couldn't afford to buy _razhurs_--and his great strong arms and bare legs, and no covering but the goat-skin that reached from his waist to his knees" ,  ' Perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes, and never lived anywhere except in the water, but if you went to Australia and talked to the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country, you would learn something quite different  They would tell you that long, long ago you would have met fishes on the land, wandering from place to place, and hunting all sorts of animals, and if you consider how fishes are made, you will understand how difficult this must have been and how clever they were to do it  Indeed, so clever were they that they might have been hunting still if a terrible thing had not happened  One day the whole fish tribe came back very tired from a hunting expedition, and looked about for a nice, cool spot in which to pitch their camp  It was very hot, and they thought that they could not find a more comfortable place than under the branches of a large tree which grew by the bank of a river  So they made their fire to cook some food, right on the edge of a steep bank, which had a deep pool of water lying beneath it at the bottom  While the food was cooking they all stretched themselves lazily out under the tree, and were just dropping off to sleep when a big black cloud which they had never noticed spread over the sun, and heavy drops of rain began to fall, so that the fire was almost put out, and that, you know, is a very serious thing in savage countries where they have no matches, for it is very hard to light it again  To make matters worse, an icy wind began to blow, and the poor fishes were chilled right through their bodies', " 'This will never do,' said Thuggai, the oldest of the fish tribe", " 'We shall die of cold unless we can light the fire again,' and he bade his sons rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame, but though they rubbed till they were tired, not a spark could they produce", " 'Let me try,' cried Biernuga, the bony fish, but he had no better luck, and no more had Kumbal, the bream, nor any of the rest", " 'It is no use,' exclaimed Thuggai, at last", " 'The wood is too wet", ' We must just sit and wait till the sun comes out again and dries it', "' Then a very little fish indeed, not more than four inches long and the youngest of the tribe, bowed himself before Thuggai, saying, 'Ask my father, Guddhu the cod, to light the fire", ' He is skilled in magic more than most fishes', "' So Thuggai asked him, and Guddhu stripped some pieces of bark off a tree, and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes", ' Then he knelt by the side of the fire and blew at it for a long while, till slowly the feeble red glow became a little stronger and the edges of the bark showed signs of curling up  When the rest of the tribe saw this they pressed close, keeping their backs towards the piercing wind, but Guddhu told them they must go to the other side, as he wanted the wind to fan his fire  By and by the spark grew into a flame, and a merry crackling was heard', " 'More wood,' cried Guddhi, and they all ran and gathered wood and heaped it on the flames, which leaped and roared and sputtered", " 'We shall soon be warm now,' said the people one to another", " 'Truly Guddhu is great'; and they crowded round again, closer and closer", ' Suddenly, with a shriek, a blast of wind swept down from the hills and blew the fire out towards them  They sprang back hurriedly, quite forgetting where they stood, and all fell down the bank, each tumbling over the other, till they rolled into the pool that lay below  Oh, how cold it was in that dark water on which the sun never shone! Then in an instant they felt warm again, for the fire, driven by the strong wind, had followed them right down to the bottom of the pool, where it burned as brightly as ever  And the fishes gathered round it as they had done on the top of the cliff, and found the flames as hot as before, and that fire never went out, like those upon land, but kept burning for ever  So now you know why, if you dive deep down below the cold surface of the water on a frosty day, you will find it comfortable and pleasant underneath, and be quite sorry that you cannot stay there     Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit, whose delight it was to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys  They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare  Indeed, there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle  At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole, so every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew', " Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight, just when the shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound asleep", ' Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang to the ground  The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the cowboys, however fatigued they might be, and they dragged themselves wearily to the stable to put back the chains  But no sooner had they returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on till the morning  Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning, while Puck, hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying himself amazingly all the time  One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating loudly  William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner  So he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on his way  The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and staggered along as best he could under his load', " 'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and made him jump", " 'Where are you?' said the voice, and the sheep answered: 'Here on the shoulders of a donkey", "' In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him", " But as he went, a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears, and though he tried not to hear, the words reached him, 'Oh, dear! What fun I have had, to be sure!' Puck was careful not always to play his tricks in the same place, but visited one village after another, so that everyone trembled lest he should be the next victim", ' After a bit he grew tired of cowboys and shepherds, and wondered if there was no one else to give him some sport  At length he was told of a young couple who were going to the nearest town to buy all that they needed for setting up house  Quite certain that they would forget something which they could not do without, Puck waited patiently till they were jogging along in their cart on their return journey, and changed himself into a fly in order to overhear their conversation  For a long time it was very dull--all about their wedding day next month, and who were to be invited  This led the bride to her wedding dress, and she gave a little scream', " 'Just think! Oh! how could I be so stupid! I have forgotten to buy the different coloured reels of cotton to match my clothes!' 'Dear, dear!' exclaimed the young man", " 'That is unlucky; and didn't you tell me that the dressmaker was coming in to-morrow?' 'Yes, I did,' and then suddenly she gave another little scream, which had quite a different sound from the first", " 'Look! Look!' The bridegroom looked, and on one side of the road he saw a large ball of thread of all colours--of all the colours, that is, of the dresses that were tied on to the back of the cart", " 'Well, that is a wonderful piece of good fortune,' cried he, as he sprang out to get it", " 'One would think a fairy had put it there on purpose", "' 'Perhaps she has,' laughed the girl, and as she spoke she seemed to hear an echo of her laughter coming from the horse, but of course that was nonsense", ' The dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her  It matched the stuffs so perfectly, and never tied itself in knots, or broke perpetually, as most thread did  A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for their subsistence  Every day the young fellow used to go out and get what he could by begging  This continued for some time, till at last he became quite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go and try his luck in another country  He informed his wife of his intention, and ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old people during the few months that he would be absent  He begged her to be industrious, lest his parents should be angry and curse him  One morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day after day, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country', " Here he went and sat down by a merchant's shop and asked alms", ' The merchant inquired whence he had come, why he had come, and what was his caste; to which he replied that he was a Brahman, and was wandering hither and thither begging a livelihood for himself and wife and parents  Moved with pity for the man, the merchant advised him to visit the kind and generous king of that country, and offered to accompany him to the court  Now at that time it happened that the king was seeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just had built  His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the Brahman and heard that he was good and honest  He at once deputed him to the charge of this temple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and one hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages', " Two months after this, the Brahman's wife, not having heard any news of her husband, left the house and went in quest of him", " By a happy fate she arrived at the very place that he had reached, where she heard that every morning at the golden temple a golden rupee was given in the king's name to any beggar who chose to go for it", ' Accordingly, on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband  "Why have you come here?" he asked  "Why have you left my parents? Care you not whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and await my return " "No, no," said the woman  "I cannot go back to starve and see your old father and mother die  There is not a grain of rice left in the house " "O Bhagawant!" exclaimed the Brahman  "Here, take this," he continued, scribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, "and give it to the king  You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it " Thus saying he dismissed her, and the woman left  On this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice--First, If a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him be careful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he close them in death  Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and visits her in great pomp, she will receive him for the sake of what she can obtain from him; but if he comes to her in poverty, she will frown on him and disown him  Thirdly, If a man has to do any work, he must do it himself, and do it with might and without fear  On reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with her husband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but not liking to go before the king herself, she sent one of her relations  The king read the paper, and ordering the man to be flogged, dismissed him', " The next morning the Brahmani took the paper, and while she was going along the road to the darbar reading it, the king's son met her, and asked what she was reading, whereupon she replied that she held in her hands a paper containing certain bits of advice, for which she wanted a lac of rupees" ,  ' There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself', " This so grieved the father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother's tears and prayers, Aladdin did not mend his ways", ' One day, when he was playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he were not the son of Mustapha the tailor  "I am, sir," replied Aladdin; "but he died a long while ago " On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying: "I am your uncle, and knew you from your likeness to my brother  Go to your mother and tell her I am coming " Aladdin ran home, and told his mother of his newly found uncle  "Indeed, child," she said, "your father had a brother, but I always thought he was dead " However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and fruit', " He presently fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin's mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out of the country", ' He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears  On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise  Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes, and took him all over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine  Next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates  They sat down by a fountain, and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them  They then journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains  Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself  At last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley  "We will go no farther," said the false uncle  "I will show you something wonderful; only do you gather up sticks while I kindle a fire " When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him, at the same time saying some magical words  The earth trembled a little and opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by  Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down  "What have I done, uncle?" he said piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: "Fear nothing, but obey me  Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you " At the word treasure, Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather  The stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared  "Go down," said the magician; "at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls  Tuck up your gown and go through them without touching anything, or you will die instantly  These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees' ,  " It so happened that Finn and his gigantic relatives were all working at the Giant's Causeway in order to make a bridge, or, what was still better, a good stout pad-road across to Scotland, when Finn, who was very fond of his wife, Oonagh, took it into his head that he would go home and see how the poor woman got on in his absence", ' So accordingly he pulled up a fir-tree, and after lopping off the roots and branches, made a walking-stick of it and set out on his way to Oonagh  Finn lived at this time on Knockmany Hill, which faces Cullamore, that rises up, half hill, half mountain, on the opposite side', " The truth is that honest Finn's affection for his wife was by no manner of means the whole cause of his journey home", ' There was at that time another giant, named Far Rua--some say he was Irish and some say he was Scotch--but whether Scotch or Irish, sorrow doubt of it but he was a _targer_  No other giant of the day could stand before him; and such was his strength that, when well vexed, he could give a stamp that shook the country about him  The fame and name of him went far and near, and nothing in the shape of a man, it was said, had any chance with him in a fight  Whether the story is true or not I cannot say, but the report went that by one blow of his fist he flattened a thunderbolt, and kept it in his pocket in the shape of a pancake to show to all his enemies when they were about to fight him', " Undoubtedly he had given every giant in Ireland a considerable beating, barring Finn M'Coul himself; and he swore that he would never rest night or day, winter or summer, till he could serve Finn with the same sauce, if he could catch him", ' Finn, however, had a strong disinclination to meet a giant who could make a young earthquake or flatten a thunderbolt when he was angry, so accordingly he kept dodging about from place to place--not much to his credit as a Trojan, to be sure--whenever he happened to get the hard word that Far Rua was on the scent of him  And the long and the short of it was that he heard Far Rua was coming to the Causeway to have a trial of strength with him; and he was, naturally enough, seized in consequence with a very warm and sudden fit of affection for his wife, who was delicate in her health, poor woman, and leading, besides, a very lonely, uncomfortable life of it in his absence  "God save all here," said Finn good-humouredly, putting his honest face into his own door  "Musha, Finn, avick, an\' you\'re welcome to your own Oonagh, you darlin\' bully " Here followed a smack that it is said to have made the waters of the lake curl, as it were, with kindness and sympathy  "Faith," said Finn, "beautiful; and how are you, Oonagh--and how did you sport your figure during my absence, my bilberry?" "Never a merrier--as bouncing a grass widow as ever there was in sweet \'Tyrone among the bushes \'" Finn gave a short, good-humoured cough, and laughed most heartily to show her how much he was delighted that she made herself happy in his absence  "An\' what brought you home so soon, Finn?" said she  "Why, avourneen," said Finn, putting in his answer in the proper way, "never the thing but the purest of love and affection for yourself', " Sure, you know that's truth, anyhow, Oonagh", '" Finn spent two or three happy days with Oonagh, and felt himself very comfortable considering the dread he had of Far Rua  This, however, grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive something lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself  Let a woman alone in the meantime for ferreting or wheedling a secret out of her good man when she wishes  Finn was a proof of this  "It\'s this Far Rua," said he, "that\'s troublin\' me', " When the fellow gets angry and begins to stamp he'll shake you a whole townland, and it's well known that he can stop a thunderbolt, for he always carries one about with him in the shape of a pancake to show to anyone that might misdoubt it", '" As he spoke he clapped his thumb in his mouth, as he always did when he wanted to prophesy or to know anything  "He\'s coming," said Finn; "I see him below at Dungannon " "An\' who is it, avick?" "Far Rua," replied Finn, "and how to manage I don\'t know  If I run away I am disgraced, and I know that sooner or later I must meet him, for my thumb tells me so " "When will he be here?" says she  Once upon a time there were two orphan children, a little boy and a little girl  Their father and mother were dead, and they had not even an old grandfather to spend his time in telling them stories  They were alone', " The little boy was called Vanoushka, and the little girl's name was Alenoushka", ' They set out together to walk through the whole of the great wide world  It was a long journey they set out on, and they did not think of any end to it, but only of moving on and on, and never stopping long enough in one place to be unhappy there  They were travelling one day over a broad plain, padding along on their little bare feet  There were no trees on the plain, no bushes; open flat country as far as you could see, and the great sun up in the sky burning the grass and making their throats dry, and the sandy ground so hot that they could scarcely bear to set their feet on it  All day from early morning they had been walking, and the heat grew greater and greater towards noon  "Oh," said little Vanoushka, "my throat is so dry  I want a drink  I must have a drink--just a little drink of cool water " "We must go on," said Alenoushka, "till we come to a well  Then we will drink " They went on along the track, with their eyes burning and their throats as dry as sand on a stove  But presently Vanoushka cried out joyfully', " He saw a horse's hoofmark in the ground", ' And it was full of water, like a little well  "Sister, sister," says he, "the horse has made a little well for me with his great hoof, and now we can have a drink; and oh, but I am thirsty!" "Not yet, brother," says Alenoushka  "If you drink from the hoofmark of a horse, you will turn into a little foal, and that would never do " "I am so very thirsty," says Vanoushka; but he did as his sister told him, and they walked on together under the burning sun  A little farther on Vanoushka saw the hoofmark of a cow, and there was water in it glittering in the sun  "Sister, sister," says Vanoushka, "the cow has made a little well for me, and now I can have a drink " "Not yet, brother," says Alenoushka  "If you drink from the hoofmark of a cow, you will turn into a little calf, and that would never do  We must go on till we come to a well  There we will drink and rest ourselves  There will be trees by the well, and shadows, and we will lie down there by the quiet water and cool our hands and feet, and perhaps our eyes will stop burning " So they went on farther along the track that scorched the bare soles of their feet, and under the sun that burned their heads and their little bare necks  The sun was high in the sky above them, and it seemed to Vanoushka that they would never come to the well  Once upon a time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the future Buddha returned to life as his son and heir  And when the day came for choosing a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta  He grew up in due course; and when he was sixteen years old, went to Takkasila, and became accomplished in all arts  And after his father died he ascended the throne, and ruled the kingdom with righteousness and equity  He gave judgments without partiality, hatred, ignorance, or fear  Since he thus reigned with justice, with justice also his ministers administered the law  Law-suits being thus decided with justice, there were none who brought false cases', " And as these ceased, the noise and tumult of litigation ceased in the king's court", ' Though the judges sat all day in the court, they had to leave without any one coming for justice  It came to this, that the Hall of Justice would have to be closed! Then the future Buddha thought, "It cannot be from my reigning with righteousness that none come for judgment; the bustle has ceased, and the Hall of Justice will have to be closed  I must, therefore, now examine into my own faults; and if I find that anything is wrong in me, put that away, and practise only virtue " Thenceforth he sought for some one to tell him his faults, but among those around him he found no one who would tell him of any fault, but heard only his own praise  Then he thought, "It is from fear of me that these men speak only good things, and not evil things," and he sought among those people who lived outside the palace  And finding no fault-finder there, he sought among those who lived outside the city, in the suburbs, at the four gates  And there too finding no one to find fault, and hearing only his own praise, he determined to search the country places  So he made over the kingdom to his ministers, and mounted his chariot; and taking only his charioteer, left the city in disguise  And searching the country through, up to the very boundary, he found no fault-finder, and heard only of his own virtue; and so he turned back from the outer-most boundary, and returned by the high road towards the city  Now at that time the king of Kosala, Mallika by name, was also ruling his kingdom with righteousness; and when seeking for some fault in himself, he also found no fault-finder in the palace but only heard of his own virtue! So seeking in country places, he too came to that very spot  And these two came face to face in a low cart-track with precipitous sides, where there was no space for a chariot to get out of the way! Then the charioteer of Mallika the king said to the charioteer of the king of Benares, "Take thy chariot out of the way!" But he said, "Take thy chariot out of the way, O charioteer! In this chariot sitteth the lord over the kingdom of Benares, the great king Brahma-datta " Yet the other replied, "In this chariot, O charioteer, sitteth the lord over the kingdom of Kosala, the great king Mallika  Take thy carriage out of the way, and make room for the chariot of our king!" Then the charioteer of the king of Benares thought, "They say then that he too is a king! What _is_ now to be done?" After some consideration, he said to himself, "I know a way', " I'll find out how old he is, and then I'll let the chariot of the younger be got out of the way, and so make room for the elder", '" And when he had arrived at that conclusion, he asked that charioteer what the age of the king of Kosala was  But on inquiry he found that the ages of both were equal  Then he inquired about the extent of his kingdom, and about his army, and his wealth, and his renown, and about the country he lived in, and his caste and tribe and family  And he found that both were lords of a kingdom three hundred leagues in extent; and that in respect of army and wealth and renown, and the countries in which they lived, and their caste and their tribe and their family, they were just on a par! Then he thought, "I will make way for the most righteous " And he asked, "What kind of righteousness has this king of yours?" Then the chorister of the king of Kosala, proclaiming his king\'s wickedness as goodness, uttered the First Stanza:   "The strong he overthrows by strength,   The mild by mildness, does Mallika;   The good he conquers by goodness,   And the wicked by wickedness too     Such is the nature of _this_ king!    Move out of the way, O charioteer!" But the charioteer of the king of Benares asked him, "Well, have you told all the virtues of your king?" "Yes," said the other  "If these are his _virtues_, where are then his faults?" replied he  The other said, "Well, for the nonce, they shall be faults, if you like! But pray, then, what is the kind of goodness your king has?" And then the charioteer of the king of Benares called unto him to hearken, and uttered the Second Stanza:   "Anger he conquers by calmness,   And by goodness the wicked;   The stingy he conquers by gifts,   And by truth the speaker of lies  In a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people, that there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden; and where, on this account, most persons are obliged to content themselves with flowers in pots; there lived two little children, who had a garden somewhat larger than a flower-pot  They were not brother and sister; but they cared for each other as much as if they were  Their parents lived exactly opposite  They inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of the one house joined that of the other, and the gutter ran along the extreme end of it, there was to each house a small window: one needed only to step over the gutter to get from one window to the other', " The children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables for the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides: there was a rose in each box, and they grew splendidly", ' They now thought of placing the boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window to the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers  The tendrils of the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long branches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other: it was almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers  The boxes were very high, and the children knew that they must not creep over them; so they often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other, and to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play delightfully  In winter there was an end of this pleasure  The windows were often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on the stove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then they had a capital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each peeped a gentle friendly eye--it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking out  His name was Kay, hers was Gerda  In summer, with one jump, they could get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to go down the long stairs, and then up the long stairs again: and out-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm  "It is the white bees that are swarming," said Kay\'s old grandmother  "Do the white bees choose a queen?" asked the little boy; for he knew that the honey-bees always have one  "Yes," said the grandmother, "she flies where the swarm hangs in the thickest clusters  She is the largest of all; and she can never remain quietly on the earth, but goes up again into the black clouds', " Many a winter's night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in at the windows; and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they look like flowers", '" "Yes, I have seen it," said both the children; and so they knew that it was true  "Can the Snow Queen come in?" said the little girl  "Only let her come in!" said the little boy  "Then I\'d put her on the stove, and she\'d melt " And then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories  In the evening, when little Kay was at home, and half undressed, he climbed up on the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little hole  A few snow-flakes were falling, and one, the largest of all, remained lying on the edge of a flower-pot  The flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a young lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little flakes like stars  She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of ice, of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly, like two stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them  She nodded towards the window, and beckoned with her hand  The little boy was frightened, and jumped down from the chair; it seemed to him as if, at the same moment, a large bird flew past the window  The next day it was a sharp frost--and then the spring came; the sun shone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests, the windows were opened, and the little children again sat in their pretty garden, high up on the leads at the top of the house  That summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty \tAllerleirauh There was once upon a time a king who had a wife with golden hair, and she was so beautiful that her equal was not to be found on earth  It came to pass that she lay ill, and as she felt that she must soon die, she called the king and said, if you wish to marry again after my death, take no one who is not quite as beautiful as I am, and who has not just such golden hair as I have, this you must promise me  And after the king had promised her this she closed her eyes and died  For a long time the king could not be comforted, and had no thought of taking another wife  At length his councillors said, this cannot go on  The king must marry again, that we may have a queen  And now messengers were sent about far and wide, to seek a bride who equalled the late queen in beauty  In the whole world, however, none was to be found, and even if one had been found, still there would have been no one who had such golden hair  So the messengers came home as they went  Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had the same golden hair  When she was grown up the king looked at her one day, and saw that in every respect she was like his late wife, and suddenly felt a violent love for her  Then he spoke to his councillors, I will marry my daughter, for she is the counterpart of my late wife, otherwise I can find no bride who resembles her  When the councillors heard that, they were shocked, and said, God has forbidden a father to marry his daughter  No good can come from such a crime, and the kingdom will be involved in the ruin', " The daughter was still more shocked when she became aware of her father's resolution, but hoped to turn him from his design", ' Then she said to him, before I fulfil your wish, I must have three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars, besides this, I wish for a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur and peltry joined together, and one of every kind of animal in your kingdom must give a piece of his skin for it  For she thought, to get that will be quite impossible, and thus I shall divert my father from his wicked intentions  The king, however, did not give it up, and the cleverest maidens in his kingdom had to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars, and his huntsmen had to catch one of every kind of animal in the whole of his kingdom, and take from it a piece of its skin, and out of these was made a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur  At length, when all was ready, the king caused the mantle to be brought, spread it out before her, and said, the wedding shall be tomorrow', " When, therefore, the king's daughter saw that there was no longer any hope of turning her father's heart, she resolved to run away", ' In the night whilst every one was asleep, she got up, and took three different things from her treasures, a golden ring, a golden spinning-wheel, and a golden reel  The three dresses of the sun, moon, and stars she placed into a nutshell, put on her mantle of all kinds of fur, and blackened her face and hands with soot  Then she commended herself to God, and went away, and walked the whole night until she reached a great forest  And as she was tired, she got into a hollow tree, and fell asleep  The sun rose, and she slept on, and she was still sleeping when it was full day  Then it so happened that the king to whom this forest belonged, was hunting in it  When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran barking round about it  The king said to the huntsmen, just see what kind of wild beast has hidden itself in there  The huntsmen obeyed his order, and when they came back they said, a wondrous beast is lying in the hollow tree, we have never before seen one like it  Its skin is fur of a thousand different kinds, but it is lying asleep  In the middle of a great forest there lived a long time ago a charcoal-burner and his wife  They were both young and handsome and strong, and when they got married, they thought work would never fail them  But bad times came, and they grew poorer and poorer, and the nights in which they went hungry to bed became more and more frequent', " Now one evening the king of that country was hunting near the charcoal-burner's hut", ' As he passed the door, he heard a sound of sobbing, and being a good-natured man he stopped to listen, thinking that perhaps he might be able to give some help', " 'Were there ever two people so unhappy!' said a woman's voice", " 'Here we are, ready to work like slaves the whole day long, and no work can we get", ' And it is all because of the curiosity of old mother Eve! If she had only been like me, who never want to know anything, we should all have been as happy as kings to-day, with plenty to eat, and warm clothes to wear', " Why--' but at this point a loud knock interrupted her lamentations", " 'Who is there?' asked she", " 'I!' replied somebody", ' \'And who is "I"?\' \'The king  Let me in', "' Full of surprise the woman jumped up and pulled the bar away from the door", " As the king entered, he noticed that there was no furniture in the room at all, not even a chair, so he pretended to be in too great a hurry to see anything around him, and only said 'You must not let me disturb you", ' I have no time to stay, but you seemed to be in trouble', " Tell me; are you very unhappy?' 'Oh, my lord, we can find no work and have eaten nothing for two days!' answered she", " 'Nothing remains for us but to die of hunger", "' 'No, no, you shan't do that,' cried the king, 'or if you do, it will be your own fault", ' You shall come with me into my palace, and you will feel as if you were in Paradise, I promise you  In return, I only ask one thing of you, that you shall obey my orders exactly', "' The charcoal-burner and his wife both stared at him for a moment, as if they could hardly believe their ears; and, indeed, it was not to be wondered at! Then they found their tongues, and exclaimed together: 'Oh, yes, yes, my lord! we will do everything you tell us", " How could we be so ungrateful as to disobey you, when you are so kind?' The king smiled, and his eyes twinkled", " 'Well, let us start at once,' said he", " 'Lock your door, and put the key in your pocket", "' The woman looked as if she thought this was needless, seeing it was quite, quite certain they would never come back", ' But she dared not say so, and did as the king told her', " After walking through the forest for a couple of miles, they all three reached the palace, and by the king's orders servants led the charcoal-burner and his wife into rooms filled with beautiful things such as they had never even dreamed of", ' First they bathed in green marble baths where the water looked like the sea, and then they put on silken clothes that felt soft and pleasant', " When they were ready, one of the king's special servants entered, and took them into a small hall, where dinner was laid, and this pleased them better than anything else" ,  ' Many years ago there lived a King, who was twice married  His first wife, a good and beautiful woman, died at the birth of her little son, and the King her husband was so overwhelmed with grief at her loss that his only comfort was in the sight of his heir', " When the time for the young Prince's christening came the King chose as godmother a neighbouring Princess, so celebrated for her wisdom and goodness that she was commonly called 'the Good Queen", "' She named the baby Alphege, and from that moment took him to her heart", ' Time wipes away the greatest griefs, and after two or three years the King married again  His second wife was a Princess of undeniable beauty, but by no means of so amiable a disposition as the first Queen  In due time a second Prince was born, and the Queen was devoured with rage at the thought that Prince Alphege came between her son and the throne  She took care however to conceal her jealous feelings from the King  At length she could control herself no longer, so she sent a trusty servant to her old and faithful friend the Fairy of the Mountain, to beg her to devise some means by which she might get rid of her stepson  The Fairy replied that, much as she desired to be agreeable to the Queen in every way, it was impossible for her to attempt anything against the young Prince, who was under the protection of some greater Power than her own', " The 'Good Queen' on her side watched carefully over her godson", " She was obliged to do so from a distance, her own country being a remote one, but she was well informed of all that went on and knew all about the Queen's wicked designs", " She therefore sent the Prince a large and splendid ruby, with injunctions to wear it night and day as it would protect him from all attacks, but added that the talisman only retained its power as long as the Prince remained within his father's dominions", ' The Wicked Queen knowing this made every attempt to get the Prince out of the country, but her efforts failed, till one day accident did what she was unable to accomplish  The King had an only sister who was deeply attached to him, and who was married to the sovereign of a distant country  She had always kept up a close correspondence with her brother, and the accounts she heard of Prince Alphege made her long to become acquainted with so charming a nephew  She entreated the King to allow the Prince to visit her, and after some hesitation which was overruled by his wife, he finally consented  Prince Alphege was at this time fourteen years old, and the handsomest and most engaging youth imaginable  In his infancy he had been placed in the charge of one of the great ladies of the Court, who, according to the prevailing custom, acted first as his head nurse and then as his governess  When he outgrew her care her husband was appointed as his tutor and governor, so that he had never been separated from this excellent couple, who loved him as tenderly as they did their only daughter Zayda, and were warmly loved by him in return  When the Prince set forth on his travels it was but natural that this devoted couple should accompany him, and accordingly he started with them and attended by a numerous retinue', " For some time he travelled through his father's dominions and all went well; but soon after passing the frontier they had to cross a desert plain under a burning sun", ' They were glad to take shelter under a group of trees near, and here the Prince complained of burning thirst  Luckily a tiny stream ran close by and some water was soon procured, but no sooner had he tasted it than he sprang from his carriage and disappeared in a moment  In vain did his anxious followers seek for him, he was nowhere to be found', " As they were hunting and shouting through the trees a black monkey suddenly appeared on a point of rock and said: 'Poor sorrowing people, you are seeking your Prince in vain", ' Return to your own country and know that he will not be restored to you till you have for some time failed to recognise him', "' With these words he vanished, leaving the courtiers sadly perplexed; but as all their efforts to find the Prince were useless they had no choice but to go home, bringing with them the sad news, which so greatly distressed the King that he fell ill and died not long after", " The Queen, whose ambition was boundless, was delighted to see the crown on her son's head and to have the power in her own hands", ' Her hard rule made her very unpopular, and it was commonly believed that she had made away with Prince Alphege  Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings  The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion, and thought that there was no one like him in the world, till, by-and-by, it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp, Andras Baive by name, who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff  Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that, and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense, why, let them! The winter was long and cold, and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive, when suddenly, on a frosty day, he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso  The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength, and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour  As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore, and his face shone with pleasure', " 'That is the very thing,' laughed he, 'I will make him jump over that boat", "' Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge, and they soon settled the terms of the wager", ' He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner, and would get a large sum of money as the prize  So, followed by many of the villagers, the two men walked down to the sea  An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play, and to hold the stakes, and Andras, as the stranger was told to jump first  Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place, he ran forward, with his head well thrown back, and cleared the boat with a mighty bound  The lookers- on cheered him, and indeed he well deserve it; but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do  On he came, taller than Andras by several inches, but heavier of build  He too sprang high and well, but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat', " Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk, but Andras only laughed and said carelessly: 'Just a little too short, bailiff; next time you must do better than that", "' The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival's scornful words, and answered quickly: 'Next time you will have something harder to do", "' And turning his back on his friends, he went sulkily home", ' Andras, putting the money he had earned in his pocket, went home also  The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso  A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off; and the bailiff, disguising himself as a Stalo, or ogre, called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras  Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands, thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump  He wandered on, his eyes fixed on the sands, so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock, while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves  A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself, and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage', " 'Dear me! I may find some use for that,' he said; and hastened down to the sea, waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him", ' Suddenly--he could not have told why--a nameless fear seized upon him, and he fled away from the shore as if for his life', " As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe, such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use; and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat: 'Next time you will have something harder to do", "' So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen, but the bailiff himself", ' It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain, where the sun never set, and it was very difficult to get to sleep, Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic, and this stood him in good stead now  The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer, and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles  Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing  My grandfather, Andrew Coffey, was known to the whole barony as a quiet, decent man  And if the whole barony knew him, he knew the whole barony, every inch, hill and dale, bog and pasture, field and covert', " Fancy his surprise one evening, when he found himself in a part of the demesne he couldn't recognise a bit", " He and his good horse were always stumbling up against some tree or stumbling down into some bog-hole that by rights didn't ought to be there", ' On the top of all this the rain came pelting down wherever there was a clearing, and the cold March wind tore through the trees', " Glad he was then when he saw a light in the distance, and drawing near found a cabin, though for the life of him he couldn't think how it came there", ' However, in he walked, after tying up his horse, and right welcome was the brushwood fire blazing on the hearth  And there stood a chair right and tight, that seemed to say, "Come, sit down in me " There wasn\'t a soul else in the room  Well, he did sit, and got a little warm and cheered after his drenching  But all the while he was wondering and wondering  "Andrew Coffey! Andrew Coffey!" Good heavens! who was calling him, and not a soul in sight? Look around as he might, indoors and out, he could find no creature with two legs or four, for his horse was gone  "ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY! tell me a story " It was louder this time, and it was nearer  And then what a thing to ask for! It was bad enough not to be let sit by the fire and dry oneself, without being bothered for a story  "ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY!! Tell me a story, or it\'ll be the worse for you " My poor grandfather was so dumbfounded that he could only stand and stare  "ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY! I told you it\'d be the worse for you " And with that, out there bounced, from a cupboard that Andrew Coffey had never noticed before, _a man_  And the man was in a towering rage', " But it wasn't that", " And he carried as fine a blackthorn as you'd wish to crack a man's head with", " But it wasn't that either", " But when my grandfather clapped eyes on him, he knew him for Patrick Rooney, and all the world knew _he'd_ gone overboard, fishing one night long years before", ' Andrew Coffey would neither stop nor stay, but he took to his heels and was out of the house as hard as he could  He ran and he ran taking little thought of what was before till at last he ran up against a big tree  And then he sat down to rest', " He hadn't sat for a moment when he heard voices", ' "It\'s heavy he is, the vagabond " "Steady now, we\'ll rest when we get under the big tree yonder  Long, long ago there lived a great Chinese Empress who succeeded her brother the Emperor Fuki  It was the age of giants, and the Empress Jokwa, for that was her name, was twenty-five feet high, nearly as tall as her brother  She was a wonderful woman, and an able ruler', " There is an interesting story of how she mended a part of the broken heavens and one of the terrestrial pillars which upheld the sky, both of which were damaged during a rebellion raised by one of King Fuki's subjects", " The rebel's name was Kokai", ' He was twenty-six feet high  His body was entirely covered with hair, and his face was as black as iron  He was a wizard and a very terrible character indeed', " When the Emperor Fuki died, Kokai was bitten with the ambition to be Emperor of China, but his plan failed, and Jokwa, the dead Emperor's sister, mounted the throne", ' Kokai was so angry at being thwarted in his desire that he raised a revolt  His first act was to employ the Water Devil, who caused a great flood to rush over the country', " This swamped the poor people out of their homes, and when the Empress Jokwa saw the plight of her subjects, and knew it was Kokai's fault, she declared war against him", ' Now Jokwa, the Empress, had two young warriors called Hako and Eiko, and the former she made General of the front forces', " Hako was delighted that the Empress's choice should fall on him, and he prepared himself for battle", ' He took up the longest lance he could find and mounted a red horse, and was just about to set out when he heard some one galloping hard behind him and shouting: "Hako! Stop! The general of the front forces must be I!" He looked back and saw Eiko his comrade, riding on a white horse, in the act of unsheathing a large sword to draw upon him  Hako\'s anger was kindled, and as he turned to face his rival he cried: "Insolent wretch! I have been appointed by the Empress to lead the front forces to battle  Do you dare to stop me?" "Yes," answered Eiko  "I ought to lead the army  It is you who should follow me " At this bold reply Hako\'s anger burst from a spark into a flame  "Dare you answer me thus? Take that," and he lunged at him with his lance', " But Eiko moved quickly aside, and at the same time, raising his sword, he wounded the head of the General's horse", ' Obliged to dismount, Hako was about to rush at his antagonist, when Eiko, as quick as lightning, tore from his breast the badge of commandership and galloped away  The action was so quick that Hako stood dazed, not knowing what to do  The Empress had been a spectator of the scene, and she could not but admire the quickness of the ambitious Eiko, and in order to pacify the rivals she determined to appoint them both to the Generalship of the front army  So Hako was made commander of the left wing of the front army, and Eiko of the right  One hundred thousand soldiers followed them and marched to put down the rebel Kokai  Within a short time the two Generals reached the castle where Kokai had fortified himself  When aware of their approach, the wizard said: "I will blow these two poor children away with one breath " (He little thought how hard he would find the fight  My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire, and I was the third of four sons  He sent me to Cambridge at fourteen years old, and after studying there three years I was bound apprentice to Mr  Bates, a famous surgeon in London  There, as my father now and then sent me small sums of money, I spent them in learning navigation, and other arts useful to those who travel, as I always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do  Three years after my leaving him my good master, Mr  Bates, recommended me as ship\'s surgeon to the "Swallow," on which I voyaged three years  When I came back I settled in London, and, having taken part of a small house, I married Miss Mary Burton, daughter of Mr  Edmund Burton, hosier  But my good master Bates died two years after; and as I had few friends my business began to fail, and I determined to go again to sea  After several voyages, I accepted an offer from Captain W  Pritchard, master of the "Antelope," who was making a voyage to the South Sea  We set sail from Bristol, May 4, 1699; and our voyage at first was very prosperous', " But in our passage to the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen's Land", ' Twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food, and the rest were in a very weak condition  On the 5th of November, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship; but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it, and immediately split  Six of the crew, of whom I was one, letting down the boat, got clear of the ship, and we rowed about three leagues, till we could work no longer  We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves; and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall  What became of my companions in the boat, or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but I conclude they were all lost  For my part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide; but when I was able to struggle no longer I found myself within my depth  By this time the storm was much abated', " I reached the shore at last, about eight o'clock in the evening, and advanced nearly half a mile inland, but could not discover any sign of inhabitants", ' I was extremely tired, and with the heat of the weather I found myself much inclined to sleep  I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, and slept sounder than ever I did in my life for about nine hours  When I woke, it was just daylight  I attempted to rise, but could not; for as I happened to be lying on my back, I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner  I could only look upward  The sun began to grow hot, and the light hurt my eyes  I heard a confused noise about me, but could see nothing except the sky  In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg, which, advancing gently over my breast, came almost up to my chin, when, bending my eyes downward, I perceived it to be a human creature, not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back  In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first  Al the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale for the rose in the silent starlight night  The winged songster serenades the fragrant flowers  Not far from Smyrna, where the merchant drives his loaded camels, proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath the lofty pines over holy ground, I saw a hedge of roses  The turtle-dove flew among the branches of the tall trees, and as the sunbeams fell upon her wings, they glistened as if they were mother-of-pearl  On the rose-bush grew a flower, more beautiful than them all, and to her the nightingale sung of his woes; but the rose remained silent, not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathy on her leaves  At last she bowed her head over a heap of stones, and said, "Here rests the greatest singer in the world; over his tomb will I spread my fragrance, and on it I will let my leaves fall when the storm scatters them  He who sung of Troy became earth, and from that earth I have sprung  I, a rose from the grave of Homer, am too lofty to bloom for a nightingale " Then the nightingale sung himself to death  A camel-driver came by, with his loaded camels and his black slaves; his little son found the dead bird, and buried the lovely songster in the grave of the great Homer, while the rose trembled in the wind  The evening came, and the rose wrapped her leaves more closely round her, and dreamed: and this was her dream  It was a fair sunshiny day; a crowd of strangers drew near who had undertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of Homer  Among the strangers was a minstrel from the north, the home of the clouds and the brilliant lights of the aurora borealis  He plucked the rose and placed it in a book, and carried it away into a distant part of the world, his fatherland  The rose faded with grief, and lay between the leaves of the book, which he opened in his own home, saying, "Here is a rose from the grave of Homer " Then the flower awoke from her dream, and trembled in the wind', " A drop of dew fell from the leaves upon the singer's grave", ' The sun rose, and the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever  The day was hot, and she was still in her own warm Asia  Then footsteps approached, strangers, such as the rose had seen in her dream, came by, and among them was a poet from the north; he plucked the rose, pressed a kiss upon her fresh mouth, and carried her away to the home of the clouds and the northern lights  Like a mummy, the flower now rests in his "Iliad," and, as in her dream, she hears him say, as he opens the book, "Here is a rose from the grave of Homer "     Curdie spent many nights in the mine  His father and he had taken Mrs', " Peterson into the secret, for they knew mother could hold her tongue, which was more than could be said of all the miners' wives", ' But Curdie did not tell her that every night he spent in the mine, part of it went in earning a new red petticoat for her  Mrs  Peterson was such a nice good mother! All mothers are nice and good more or less, but Mrs  Peterson was nice and good all more and no less  She made and kept a little heaven in that poor cottage on the high hillside for her husband and son to go home to out of the low and rather dreary earth in which they worked  I doubt if the princess was very much happier even in the arms of her huge great-grandmother than Peter and Curdie were in the arms of Mrs  Peterson  True, her hands were hard and chapped and large, but it was with work for them; and therefore, in the sight of the angels, her hands were so much the more beautiful  And if Curdie worked hard to get her a petticoat, she worked hard every day to get him comforts which he would have missed much more than she would a new petticoat even in winter  Not that she and Curdie ever thought of how much they worked for each other: that would have spoiled everything  When left alone in the mine Curdie always worked on for an hour or two at first, following the lode which, according to Glump, would lead at last into the deserted habitation  After that, he would set out on a reconnoitring expedition', " In order to manage this, or rather the return from it, better than the first time, he had bought a huge ball of fine string, having learned the trick from Hop-o'-my-Thumb, whose history his mother had often told him", " Not that Hop-o'-my-Thumb had ever used a ball of string--I should be sorry to be supposed so far out in my classics--but the principle was the same as that of the pebbles", " The end of this string he fastened to his pickaxe, which figured no bad anchor, and then, with the ball in his hand, unrolling it as he went, set out in the dark through the natural gangs of the goblins' territory", ' The first night or two he came upon nothing worth remembering; saw only a little of the home-life of the cobs in the various caves they called houses; failed in coming upon anything to cast light upon the foregoing design which kept the inundation for the present in the background  But at length, I think on the third or fourth night, he found, partly guided by the noise of their implements, a company of evidently the best sappers and miners amongst them, hard at work  What were they about? It could not well be the inundation, seeing that had in the meantime been postponed to something else  Then what was it? He lurked and watched, every now and then in the greatest risk of being detected, but without success  He had again and again to retreat in haste, a proceeding rendered the more difficult that he had to gather up his string as he returned upon its course  It was not that he was afraid of the goblins, but that he was afraid of their finding out that they were watched, which might have prevented the discovery at which he aimed', " Sometimes his haste had to be such that, when he reached home towards morning, his string, for lack of time to wind it up as he 'dodged the cobs', would be in what seemed most hopeless entanglement; but after a good sleep, though a short one, he always found his mother had got it right again", " There it was, wound in a most respectable ball, ready for use the moment he should want it! 'I can't think how you do it, mother,' he would say", " 'I follow the thread,' she would answer--'just as you do in the mine", "' She never had more to say about it; but the less clever she was with her words, the more clever she was with her hands; and the less his mother said, the more Curdie believed she had to say", ' But still he had made no discovery as to what the goblin miners were about     Long, long ago, in the days when fairies, witches, giants and ogres still visited the earth, there lived a king who reigned over a great and beautiful country  He was married to a wife whom he dearly loved, and had two most promising children--a son called Asmund, and a daughter who was named Signy  The king and queen were very anxious to bring their children up well, and the young prince and princess were taught everything likely to make them clever and accomplished', " They lived at home in their father's palace, and he spared no pains to make their lives happy", ' Prince Asmund dearly loved all outdoor sports and an open-air life, and from his earliest childhood he had longed to live entirely in the forest close by  After many arguments and entreaties he succeeded in persuading the king to give him two great oak trees for his very own', " 'Now,' said he to his sister, 'I will have the trees hollowed out, and then I will make rooms in them and furnish them so that I shall be able to live out in the forest", "' 'Oh, Asmund!' exclaimed Signy, 'what a delightful idea! Do let me come too, and live in one of your trees", ' I will bring all my pretty things and ornaments, and the trees are so near home we shall be quite safe in them', "' Asmund, who was extremely fond of his sister, readily consented, and they had a very happy time together, carrying over all their pet treasures, and Signy's jewels and other ornaments, and arranging them in the pretty little rooms inside the trees", ' Unfortunately sadder days were to come  A war with another country broke out, and the king had to lead his army against their enemy  During his absence the queen fell ill, and after lingering for some time she died, to the great grief of her children  They made up their minds to live altogether for a time in their trees, and for this purpose they had provisions enough stored up inside to last them a year  Now, I must tell you, in another country a long way off, there reigned a king who had an only son named Ring  Prince Ring had heard so much about the beauty and goodness of Princess Signy that he determined to marry her if possible  So he begged his father to let him have a ship for the voyage, set sail with a favourable wind, and after a time landed in the country where Signy lived  The prince lost no time in setting out for the royal palace, and on his way there he met such a wonderfully lovely woman that he felt he had never seen such beauty in all his life  He stopped her and at once asked who she was', " 'I am Signy, the king's daughter,' was the reply", " Then the prince inquired why she was wandering about all by herself, and she told him that since her mother's death she was so sad that whilst her father was away she preferred being alone", ' Ring was quite deceived by her, and never guessed that she was not Princess Signy at all, but a strong, gigantic, wicked witch bent on deceiving him under a beautiful shape  He confided to her that he had travelled all the way from his own country for her sake, having fallen in love with the accounts he had heard of her beauty, and he then and there asked her to be his wife  The witch listened to all he said and, much pleased, ended by accepting his offer; but she begged him to return to his ship for a little while as she wished to go some way further into the forest, promising to join him later on  Prince Ring did as she wished and went back to his ship to wait, whilst she walked on into the forest till she reached the two oak trees  Here she resumed her own gigantic shape, tore up the trees by their roots, threw one of them over her back and clasped the other to her breast, carried them down to the shore and waded out with them to the ship  She took care not to be noticed as she reached the ship, and directly she got on board she once more changed to her former lovely appearance and told the prince that her luggage was now all on board, and that they need wait for nothing more  The prince gave orders to set sail at once, and after a fine voyage landed in his own country, where his parents and his only sister received him with the greatest joy and affection  The false Signy was also very kindly welcomed  A beautiful house was got ready for her, and Prince Ring had the two oaks planted in the garden just in front of her windows so that she might have the pleasure of seeing them constantly  There was once a Darning-needle who thought herself so fine that she believed she was an embroidery-needle', " 'Take great care to hold me tight!' said the Darning-needle to the Fingers who were holding her", " 'Don't let me fall! If I once fall on the ground I shall never be found again, I am so fine!' 'It is all right!' said the Fingers, seizing her round the waist", " 'Look, I am coming with my train!' said the Darning-needle as she drew a long thread after her; but there was no knot at the end of the thread", " The Fingers were using the needle on the cook's shoe", ' The upper leather was unstitched and had to be sewn together', " 'This is common work!' said the Darning-needle", " 'I shall never get through it", " I am breaking! I am breaking!' And in fact she did break", " 'Didn't I tell you so!' said the Darning-needle", " 'I am too fine!' 'Now she is good for nothing!' said the Fingers; but they had to hold her tight while the cook dropped some sealing-wax on the needle and stuck it in the front of her dress", " 'Now I am a breast-pin!' said the Darning-needle", " 'I always knew I should be promoted", " When one is something, one will become something!' And she laughed to herself; you can never see when a Darning-needle is laughing", ' Then she sat up as proudly as if she were in a State coach, and looked all round her', " 'May I be allowed to ask if you are gold?' she said to her neighbour, the Pin", " 'You have a very nice appearance, and a peculiar head; but it is too small! You must take pains to make it grow, for it is not everyone who has a head of sealing-wax", "' And so saying the Darning-needle raised herself up so proudly that she fell out of the dress, right into the sink which the cook was rinsing out", " 'Now I am off on my travels!' said the Darning-needle", " 'I do hope I sha'n't get lost!' She did indeed get lost", " 'I am too fine for this world!' said she as she lay in the gutter; 'but I know who I am, and that is always a little satisfaction!' And the Darning-needle kept her proud bearing and did not lose her good-temper", ' All kinds of things swam over her--shavings, bits of straw, and scraps of old newspapers', " 'Just look how they sail along!' said the Darning-needle", " 'They don't know what is underneath them! Here I am sticking fast! There goes a shaving thinking of nothing in the world but of itself, a mere chip! There goes a straw--well, how it does twist and twirl, to be sure! Don't think so much about yourself, or you will be knocked against a stone", ' There floats a bit of newspaper  What is written on it is long ago forgotten, and yet how proud it is! I am sitting patient and quiet', " I know who I am, and that is enough for me!' One day something thick lay near her which glittered so brightly that the Darning-needle thought it must be a diamond", ' But it was a bit of bottle-glass, and because it sparkled the Darning-needle spoke to it, and gave herself out as a breast-pin', " 'No doubt you are a diamond?' 'Yes, something of that kind!' And each believed that the other was something very costly; and they both said how very proud the world must be of them", " 'I have come from a lady's work-box,' said Darning-needle, 'and this lady was a cook; she had five fingers on each hand; anything so proud as these fingers I have never seen! And yet they were only there to take me out of the work-box and to put me back again!' 'Were they of noble birth, then?' asked the bit of bottle-glass" ,  ' This story is from the sand-dunes or sand-hills of Jutland, but it does not begin there in the North, but far away in the South, in Spain  The wide sea is the highroad from nation to nation; journey in thought; then, to sunny Spain  It is warm and beautiful there; the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark laurels; a cool refreshing breeze from the mountains blows over the orange gardens, over the Moorish halls with their golden cupolas and coloured walls  Children go through the streets in procession with candles and waving banners, and the sky, lofty and clear with its glittering stars, rises above them  Sounds of singing and castanets can be heard, and youths and maidens dance upon the flowering acacia trees, while even the beggar sits upon a block of marble, refreshing himself with a juicy melon, and dreamily enjoying life  It all seems like a beautiful dream  Here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave themselves up to the charm of life; indeed they possessed every good thing they could desire--health and happiness, riches and honour  "We are as happy as human beings can be," said the young couple from the depths of their hearts  They had indeed only one step higher to mount on the ladder of happiness--they hoped that God would give them a child, a son like them in form and spirit  The happy little one was to be welcomed with rejoicing, to be cared for with love and tenderness, and enjoy every advantage of wealth and luxury that a rich and influential family can give  So the days went by like a joyous festival  "Life is a gracious gift from God, almost too great a gift for us to appreciate!" said the young wife  "Yet they say that fulness of joy for ever and ever can only be found in the future life  I cannot realise it!" "The thought arises, perhaps, from the arrogance of men," said the husband  "It seems a great pride to believe that we shall live for ever, that we shall be as gods! Were not these the words of the serpent, the father of lies?" "Surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life?" exclaimed the young wife  It seemed as if one of the first shadows passed over her sunny thoughts  "Faith realises it, and the priests tell us so," replied her husband; "but amid all my happiness I feel that it is arrogant to demand a continuation of it--another life after this  Has not so much been given us in this world that we ought to be, we must be, contented with it?" "Yes, it has been given to us," said the young wife, "but this life is nothing more than one long scene of trial and hardship to many thousands  How many have been cast into this world only to endure poverty, shame, illness, and misfortune? If there were no future life, everything here would be too unequally divided, and God would not be the personification of justice " "The beggar there," said her husband, "has joys of his own which seem to him great, and cause him as much pleasure as a king would find in the magnificence of his palace  And then do you not think that the beast of burden, which suffers blows and hunger, and works itself to death, suffers just as much from its miserable fate? The dumb creature might demand a future life also, and declare the law unjust that excludes it from the advantages of the higher creation " "Christ said: \'In my father\'s house are many mansions,\'" she answered  "Heaven is as boundless as the love of our Creator; the dumb animal is also His creature, and I firmly believe that no life will be lost, but each will receive as much happiness as he can enjoy, which will be sufficient for him " "This world is sufficient for me," said the husband, throwing his arm round his beautiful, sweet-tempered wife  He sat by her side on the open balcony, smoking a cigarette in the cool air, which was loaded with the sweet scent of carnations and orange blossoms  Sounds of music and the clatter of castanets came from the road beneath, the stars shone above then, and two eyes full of affection--those of his wife--looked upon him with the expression of undying love  "Such a moment," he said, "makes it worth while to be born, to die, and to be annihilated!" He smiled--the young wife raised her hand in gentle reproof, and the shadow passed away from her mind, and they were happy--quite happy  Everything seemed to work together for their good  They advanced in honour, in prosperity, and in happiness  A change came certainly, but it was only a change of place and not of circumstances  Long, long ago there stood in the midst of a country covered with lakes a vast stretch of moorland called the Tontlawald, on which no man ever dared set foot  From time to time a few bold spirits had been drawn by curiosity to its borders, and on their return had reported that they had caught a glimpse of a ruined house in a grove of thick trees, and round about it were a crowd of beings resembling men, swarming over the grass like bees  The men were as dirty and ragged as gipsies, and there were besides a quantity of old women and half-naked children  One night a peasant who was returning home from a feast wandered a little farther into the Tontlawald, and came back with the same story  A countless number of women and children were gathered round a huge fire, and some were seated on the ground, while others danced strange dances on the smooth grass  One old crone had a broad iron ladle in her hand, with which every now and then she stirred the fire, but the moment she touched the glowing ashes the children rushed away, shrieking like night owls, and it was a long while before they ventured to steal back  And besides all this there had once or twice been seen a little old man with a long beard creeping out of the forest, carrying a sack bigger than himself  The women and children ran by his side, weeping and trying to drag the sack from off his back, but he shook them off, and went on his way  There was also a tale of a magnificent black cat as large as a foal, but men could not believe all the wonders told by the peasant, and it was difficult to make out what was true and what was false in his story  However, the fact remained that strange things did happen there, and the King of Sweden, to whom this part of the country belonged, more than once gave orders to cut down the haunted wood, but there was no one with courage enough to obey his commands  At length one man, bolder than the rest, struck his axe into a tree, but his blow was followed by a stream of blood and shrieks as of a human creature in pain  The terrified woodcutter fled as fast as his legs would carry him, and after that neither orders nor threats would drive anybody to the enchanted moor  A few miles from the Tontlawald was a large village, where dwelt a peasant who had recently married a young wife  As not uncommonly happens in such cases, she turned the whole house upside down, and the two quarrelled and fought all day long  By his first wife the peasant had a daughter called Elsa, a good quiet girl, who only wanted to live in peace, but this her stepmother would not allow  She beat and cuffed the poor child from morning till night, but as the stepmother had the whip-hand of her husband there was no remedy  For two years Elsa suffered all this ill-treatment, when one day she went out with the other village children to pluck strawberries  Carelessly they wandered on, till at last they reached the edge of the Tontlawald, where the finest strawberries grew, making the grass red with their colour', " The children flung themselves down on the ground, and, after eating as many as they wanted, began to pile up their baskets, when suddenly a cry arose from one of the older boys: 'Run, run as fast as you can! We are in the Tontlawald!' Quicker than lightning they sprang to their feet, and rushed madly away, all except Elsa, who had strayed farther than the rest, and had found a bed of the finest strawberries right under the trees", " Like the others, she heard the boy's cry, but could not make up her mind to leave the strawberries", " 'After all, what does it matter?' thought she", " 'The dwellers in the Tontlawald cannot be worse than my stepmother'; and looking up she saw a little black dog with a silver bell on its neck come barking towards her, followed by a maiden clad all in silk", " 'Be quiet,' said she; then turning to Elsa she added: 'I am so glad you did not run away with the other children", ' Stay here with me and be my friend, and we will play delightful games together, and every day we will go and gather strawberries  Nobody will dare to beat you if I tell them not', " Come, let us go to my mother'; and taking Elsa's hand she led her deeper into the wood, the little black dog jumping up beside them and barking with pleasure", " Oh! what wonders and splendours unfolded themselves before Elsa's astonished eyes! She thought she really must be in Heaven", ' Fruit trees and bushes loaded with fruit stood before them, while birds gayer than the brightest butterfly sat in their branches and filled the air with their song  And the birds were not shy, but let the girls take them in their hands, and stroke their gold and silver feathers', " In the centre of the garden was the dwelling-house, shining with glass and precious stones, and in the doorway sat a woman in rich garments, who turned to Elsa's companion and asked: 'What sort of a guest are you bringing to me?' 'I found her alone in the wood,' replied her daughter, 'and brought her back with me for a companion" ,  ' "Tell us about Baba Yaga," begged Maroosia  "Yes," said Vanya, "please, grandfather, and about the little hut on hen\'s legs " "Baba Yaga is a witch," said old Peter; "a terrible old woman she is, but sometimes kind enough  You know it was she who told Prince Ivan how to win one of the daughters of the Tzar of the Sea, and that was the best daughter of the bunch, Vasilissa the Very Wise  But then Baba Yaga is usually bad, as in the case of Vasilissa the Very Beautiful, who was only saved from her iron teeth by the cleverness of her Magic Doll " "Tell us the story of the Magic Doll," begged Maroosia  "I will some day," said old Peter  "And has Baba Yaga really got iron teeth?" asked Vanya  "Iron, like the poker and tongs," said old Peter  "What for?" said Maroosia  "To eat up little Russian children," said old Peter, "when she can get them  She usually only eats bad ones, because the good ones get away  She is bony all over, and her eyes flash, and she drives about in a mortar, beating it with a pestle, and sweeping up her tracks with a besom, so that you cannot tell which way she has gone " "And her hut?" said Vanya  He had often heard about it before, but he wanted to hear about it again  "She lives in a little hut which stands on hen\'s legs  Sometimes it faces the forest, sometimes it faces the path, and sometimes it walks solemnly about  But in some of the stories she lives in another kind of hut, with a railing of tall sticks, and a skull on each stick  And all night long fire glows in the skulls and fades as the dawn rises " "Now tell us one of the Baba Yaga stories," said Maroosia  "Please," said Vanya  "I will tell you how one little girl got away from her, and then, if ever she catches you, you will know exactly what to do " And old Peter put down his pipe and began:--     Once upon a time there was a widowed old man who lived alone in a hut with his little daughter  Very merry they were together, and they used to smile at each other over a table just piled with bread and jam  Everything went well, until the old man took it into his head to marry again  Yes, the old man became foolish in the years of his old age, and he took another wife  And so the poor little girl had a stepmother  And after that everything changed  There was no more bread and jam on the table, and no more playing bo-peep, first this side of the samovar and then that, as she sat with her father at tea  It was worse than that, for she never did sit at tea', " The stepmother said that everything that went wrong was the little girl's fault", ' And the old man believed his new wife, and so there were no more kind words for his little daughter  Day after day the stepmother used to say that the little girl was too naughty to sit at table  And then she would throw her a crust and tell her to get out of the hut and go and eat it somewhere else  And the poor little girl used to go away by herself into the shed in the yard, and wet the dry crust with her tears, and eat it all alone  Ah me! she often wept for the old days, and she often wept at the thought of the days that were to come  Mostly she wept because she was all alone, until one day she found a little friend in the shed  She was hunched up in a corner of the shed, eating her crust and crying bitterly, when she heard a little noise  It was like this: scratch--scratch  It was just that, a little gray mouse who lived in a hole  Out he came, his little pointed nose and his long whiskers, his little round ears and his bright eyes  Out came his little humpy body and his long tail  And then he sat up on his hind legs, and curled his tail twice round himself and looked at the little girl  The little girl, who had a kind heart, forgot all her sorrows, and took a scrap of her crust and threw it to the little mouse  The mouseykin nibbled and nibbled, and there, it was gone, and he was looking for another  She gave him another bit, and presently that was gone, and another and another, until there was no crust left for the little girl', " Well, she didn't mind that", ' You see, she was so happy seeing the little mouse nibbling and nibbling  When the crust was done the mouseykin looks up at her with his little bright eyes, and "Thank you," he says, in a little squeaky voice  "Thank you," he says; "you are a kind little girl, and I am only a mouse, and I\'ve eaten all your crust  But there is one thing I can do for you, and that is to tell you to take care  The old woman in the hut (and that was the cruel stepmother) is own sister to Baba Yaga, the bony-legged, the witch  Far, far in the forest there were two little huts, and in each of them lived a man who was a famous hunter, his wife, and three or four children  Now the children were forbidden to play more than a short distance from the door, as it was known that, away on the other side of the wood near the great river, there dwelt a witch who had a magic ball that she used as a means of stealing children  Her plan was a very simple one, and had never yet failed', " When she wanted a child she just flung her ball in the direction of the child's home, and however far off it might be, the ball was sure to reach it", ' Then, as soon as the child saw it, the ball would begin rolling slowly back to the witch, just keeping a little ahead of the child, so that he always thought that he could catch it the next minute  But he never did, and, what was more, his parents never saw him again  Of course you must not suppose that all the fathers and mothers who had lost children made no attempts to find them, but the forest was so large, and the witch was so cunning in knowing exactly where they were going to search, that it was very easy for her to keep out of the way  Besides, there was always the chance that the children might have been eaten by wolves, of which large herds roamed about in winter', " One day the old witch happened to want a little boy, so she threw her ball in the direction of the hunters' huts", ' A child was standing outside, shooting at a mark with his bow and arrows, but the moment he saw the ball, which was made of glass whose blues and greens and whites, all frosted over, kept changing one into the other, he flung down his bow, and stooped to pick the ball up  But as he did so it began to roll very gently downhill  The boy could not let it roll away, when it was so close to him, so he gave chase  The ball seemed always within his grasp, yet he could never catch it; it went quicker and quicker, and the boy grew more and more excited', " That time he almost touched it--no, he missed it by a hair's breadth! Now, surely, if he gave a spring he could get in front of it! He sprang forward, tripped and fell, and found himself in the witch's house! 'Welcome! welcome! grandson!' said she; 'get up and rest yourself, for you have had a long walk, and I am sure you must be tired!' So the boy sat down, and ate some food which she gave him in a bowl", ' It was quite different from anything he had tasted before, and he thought it was delicious  When he had eaten up every bit, the witch asked him if he had ever fasted', " 'No,' replied the boy, 'at least I have been obliged to sometimes, but never if there was any food to be had", "' 'You will have to fast if you want the spirits to make you strong and wise, and the sooner you begin the better", "' 'Very well,' said the boy, 'what do I do first?' 'Lie down on those buffalo skins by the door of the hut,' answered she; and the boy lay down, and the squirrels and little bears and the birds came and talked to him", ' At the end of ten days the old woman came to him with a bowl of the same food that he had eaten before', " 'Get up, my grandson, you have fasted long enough", " Have the good spirits visited you, and granted you the strength and wisdom that you desire?' 'Some of them have come, and have given me a portion of both,' answered the boy, 'but many have stayed away from me", "' 'Then,' said she, 'you must fast ten days more", "' So the boy lay down again on the buffalo skins, and fasted for ten days, and at the end of that time he turned his face to the wall, and fasted for twenty days longer", " At length the witch called to him, and said: 'Come and eat something, my grandson", "' At the sound of her voice the boy got up and ate the food she gave him", " When he had finished every scrap she spoke as before: 'Tell me, my grandson, have not the good spirits visited you all these many days that you have fasted?' 'Not all, grandmother,' answered he; 'there are still some who keep away from me and say that I have not fasted long enough", "' 'Then you must fast again,' replied the old woman, 'and go on fasting till you receive the gifts of all the good spirits", ' Not one must be missing', "' The boy said nothing, but lay down for the third time on the buffalo skins, and fasted for twenty days more" ,  'There was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted himself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets  So long as the war lasted, all went well, but when peace was made, he received his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he liked  His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he went to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him until war broke out again  The brothers, however, were hard-hearted and said, "What can we do with you? You are of no use to us, go and make a living for yourself " The soldier had nothing left but his gun, so he took that on his shoulder, and went forth into the world  He came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle of trees, under these he sat sorrowfully down, and began to think over his fate', " I have no money, thought he, I have learnt no trade but that of fighting, and now that they have made peace they don't want me any longer, so I see before hand that I shall have to starve", ' All at once he heard a rustling and when he looked round, a strange man stood before him, who wore a green coat and looked right stately, but had a hideous cloven foot  "I know already what you are in need of," said the man, "gold and possessions shall you have, as much as you can make away with, do what you will, but first I must know if you are fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain " "A soldier and fear - how can those two things go together?" he answered, "You can put me to the proof " "Very well, then," answered the man, "look behind you " The soldier turned round, and saw a large bear, which came growling towards him  "Oho," cried the soldier, "I will tickle your nose for you, so that you shall soon lose your fancy for growling," and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle, it fell down and never stirred again  "I see quite well," said the stranger, "that you are not wanting in courage, but there is still another condition which you will have to fulfil " "If it does not endanger my salvation," replied the soldier, who knew very well who was standing by him  "If it does, I\'ll have nothing to do with it " "You will look to that for yourself," answered greencoat, "you shall for the next seven years neither wash yourself, nor comb your beard, nor your hair, nor cut your nails, nor once say the Lord\'s prayer  I will give you a coat and a cloak, which during this time you must wear  If you die during these seven years, you are mine, if you remain alive, you are free, and rich to boot, for all the rest of your life " The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he now found himself, and as he so often had gone to meet death, he resolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms  The devil took off his green coat, and gave it to the soldier, and said, "If you have this coat on your back and put your hand into the pocket, you will always find it full of money " Then he pulled the skin off the bear and said, "This shall be your cloak, and your bed also, for thereon shall you sleep, and and in no other bed shall you lie, and because of this apparel shall you be called Bearskin " Whereupon the devil vanished  The soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found that the thing was really true  Then he put on the bearskin and went forth into the world, and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing that did him good and his money harm  During the first year his appearance was passable, but during the second he began to look like a monster  His hair covered nearly the whole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his fingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if cress had been sown on it, it would have come up  Whosoever saw him, ran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he might not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for everything he still always found shelter  In the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not receive him, and would not even let him have a place in the stable, because he was afraid the horses would be scared  But as Bearskin thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats, the host let himself be persuaded and gave him a room in an outhouse  There was once upon a time a young fellow who enlisted for a soldier, and became so brave and courageous that he was always in the front ranks when it rained blue beans  As long as the war lasted all went well, but when peace was concluded he received his discharge, and the captain told him he might go where he liked  His parents meanwhile had died, and as he had no longer any home to go to he paid a visit to his brothers, and asked them to give him shelter until war broke out again  His brothers, however, were hard-hearted, and said, "What could we do with you? We could make nothing of you; see to what you have brought yourself"; and so turned a deaf ear  The poor Soldier had nothing but his musket left; so he mounted this on his shoulder and set out on a tramp  By and by he came to a great heath with nothing on it but a circle of trees, under which he sat down, sorrowfully considering his fate  "I have no money," thought he; "I have learnt nothing but soldiering, and now, since peace is concluded, there is no need of me  I see well enough I shall have to starve " All at once he heard a rustling, and as he looked round he perceived a stranger standing before him, dressed in a gray coat, who looked very stately, but had an ugly cloven foot  "I know quite well what you need," said this being; "gold and other possessions you shall have, as much as you can spend; but first I must know whether you are a coward or not, that I may not spend my money foolishly " "A soldier and a coward!" replied the other, "that cannot be; you may put me to any proof " "Well, then," replied the stranger, "look behind you " The Soldier turned and saw a huge bear, which eyed him very ferociously  "Oho!" cried he, "I will tickle your nose for you, that you shall no longer be able to grumble"; and, raising his musket, he shot the bear in the forehead, so that he tumbled in a heap upon the ground, and did not stir afterward  Thereupon the stranger said, "I see quite well that you are not wanting in courage; but there is yet one condition which you must fulfil " "If it does not interfere with my future happiness," said the Soldier, who had remarked who it was that addressed him; "if it does not interfere with that, I shall not hesitate " "That you must see about yourself!" said the stranger  "For the next seven years you must not wash yourself, nor comb your hair or beard, neither must you cut your nails nor say one paternoster  Then I will give you this coat and mantle, which you must wear during these seven years; and if you die within that time you are mine, but if you live you are rich, and free all your life long " The Soldier reflected for awhile on his great necessities, and, remembering how often he had braved death, he at length consented, and ventured to accept the offer  Thereupon the Evil One pulled off the gray coat, handed it to the soldier, and said, "If you at any time search in the pockets of your coat when you have it on, you will always find your hand full of money " Then also he pulled off the skin of the bear, and said, "That shall be your cloak and your bed; you must sleep on it, and not dare to lie in any other bed, and on this account you shall be called \'Bearskin \'" Immediately the Evil One disappeared  The Soldier now put on the coat, and dipped his hands into the pockets, to assure himself of the reality of the transaction  Then he hung the bearskin around himself, and went about the world chuckling at his good luck, and buying whatever suited his fancy which money could purchase  For the first year his appearance was not very remarkable, but in the second he began to look quite a monster', " His hair covered almost all his face, his beard appeared like a piece of dirty cloth, his nails were claws, and his countenance was so covered with dirt that one might have grown cresses upon it if one had sown seed! Whoever looked at him ran away; but because he gave the poor in every place gold coin they prayed that he might not die during the seven years; and because he paid liberally everywhere, he found a night's lodging without difficulty", ' In the fourth year he came to an inn where the landlord would not take him in, and refused even to give him a place in his stables, lest the horses should be frightened and become restive  However, when Bearskin put his hand into his pocket and drew it out full of gold ducats the landlord yielded the point, and gave him a place in the outbuildings, but not till he had promised that he would not show himself, for fear the inn should gain a bad name  While Bearskin sat by himself in the evening, wishing from his heart that the seven years were over, he heard in the corner a loud groan  There was once a very rich merchant, who had six children, three sons, and three daughters; being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education, but gave them all kinds of masters  His daughters were extremely handsome, especially the youngest; when she was little, every body admired her, and called her _The little Beauty_; so that, as she grew up, she still went by the name of _Beauty_, which made her sisters very jealous  The youngest, as she was handsome, was also better than her sisters  The two eldest had a great deal of pride, because they were rich', " They gave themselves ridiculous airs, and would not visit other merchants' daughters, nor keep company with any but persons of quality", ' They went out every day upon parties of pleasure, balls, plays, concerts, etc  and laughed at their youngest sister, because she spent the greatest part of her time in reading good books  As it was known that they were to have great fortunes, several eminent merchants made their addresses to them; but the two eldest said they would never marry, unless they could meet with a Duke, or an Earl at least  Beauty very civilly thanked them that courted her, and told them she was too young yet to marry, but chose to stay with her father a few years longer  All at once the merchant lost his whole fortune, excepting a small country-house at a great distance from town, and told his children, with tears in his eyes, they most go there and work for their living  The two eldest answered, that they would not leave the town, for they had several lovers, who they were sure would be glad to have them, though they had no fortune; but in this they were mistaken, for their lovers slighted and forsook them in their poverty  As they were not beloved on account of their pride, every body said, "they do not deserve to be pitied, we are glad to see their pride humbled, let them go and give themselves quality airs in milking the cows and minding their dairy  But, (added they,) we are extremely concerned for Beauty, she was such a charming, sweet-tempered creature, spoke so kindly to poor people, and was of such an affable, obliging disposition " Nay, several gentlemen would have married her, though they knew she had not a penny; but she told them she could not think of leaving her poor father in his misfortunes, but was determined to go along with him into the country to comfort and attend him  Poor Beauty at first was sadly grieved at the loss of her fortune; "but, (she said to herself,) were I to cry ever so much, that would not make things better, I must try to make myself happy without a fortune " When they came to their country-house, the merchant and his three sons applied themselves to husbandry and tillage; and Beauty rose at four in the morning, and made haste to have the house clean, and breakfast ready for the family  In the beginning she found it very difficult, for she had not been used to work as a servant; but in less than two months she grew stronger and healthier than ever  After she had done her work, she read, played on the harpsichord, or else sung whilst she spun  On the contrary, her two sisters did not know how to spend their time; they got up at ten, and did nothing but saunter about the whole day, lamenting the loss of their fine clothes and acquaintance  "Do but see our youngest sister, (said they one to the other,) what a poor, stupid mean-spirited creature she is, to be contented with such an unhappy situation " The good merchant was of a quite different opinion; he knew very well that Beauty out-shone her sisters, in her person as well as her mind, and admired her humility, industry, and patience; for her sisters not only left her all the work of the house to do, but insulted her every moment  The family had lived about a year in this retirement, when the merchant received a letter, with an account that a vessel, on board of which he had effects, was safely arrived  This news had liked to have turned the heads of the two eldest daughters, who immediately flattered themselves with the hopes of returning to town; for they were quite weary of a country life; and when they saw their father ready to set out, they begged of him to buy them new gowns, caps, rings, and all manner of trifles; but Beauty asked for nothing, for she thought to herself, that all the money her father was going to receive would scarce be sufficient to purchase every thing her sisters wanted  "What will you have, Beauty?" said her father  "Since you are so kind as to think of me, (answered she,) be so kind as to bring me a rose, for as none grow hereabouts, they are a kind of rarity " Not that Beauty cared for a rose, but she asked for something, lest she should seem by her example to condemn her sisters\' conduct, who would have said she did it only to look particular  The good man went on his journey; but when he came there, they went to law with him about the merchandize, and after a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose, he came back as poor as before  He was within thirty miles of his own house, thinking on the pleasure he should have in seeing his children again, when going through a large forest he lost himself  It rained and snowed terribly, besides, the wind was so high, that it threw him twice off his horse; and night coming on, he began to apprehend being either starved to death with cold and hunger, or else devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all around him, when, on a sudden, looking through a long walk of trees, he saw a light at some distance, and going on a little farther, perceived it came from a palace illuminated from top to bottom  The merchant returned God thanks for this happy discovery, and hasted to the palace; but was greatly surprised at not meeting with anyone in the out-courts  Print Llewelyn had a favourite greyhound named Gellert that had been given to him by his father-in-law, King John  He was as gentle as a lamb at home but a lion in the chase  One day Llewelyn went to the chase and blew his horn in front of his castle  All his other dogs came to the call but Gellert never answered it  So he blew a louder blast on his horn and called Gellert by name, but still the greyhound did not come  At last Prince Llewelyn could wait no longer and went off to the hunt without Gellert  He had little sport that day because Gellert was not there, the swiftest and boldest of his hounds  He turned back in a rage to his castle, and as he came to the gate, who should he see but Gellert come bounding out to meet him  But when the hound came near him, the Prince was startled to see that his lips and fangs were dripping with blood  Llewelyn started back and the greyhound crouched down at his feet as if surprised or afraid at the way his master greeted him', " Now Prince Llewelyn had a little son a year old with whom Gellert used to play, and a terrible thought crossed the Prince's mind that made him rush towards the child's nursery", ' And the nearer he came the more blood and disorder he found about the rooms', " He rushed into it and found the child's cradle overturned and daubed with blood", ' Prince Llewelyn grew more and more terrified, and sought for his little son everywhere  He could find him nowhere but only signs of some terrible conflict in which much blood had been shed  At last he felt sure the dog had destroyed his child, and shouting to Gellert, "Monster, thou hast devoured my child," he drew out his sword and plunged it in the greyhound\'s side, who fell with a deep yell and still gazing in his master\'s eyes', " As Gellert raised his dying yell, a little child's cry answered it from beneath the cradle, and there Llewelyn found his child unharmed and just awakened from sleep", ' But just beside him lay the body of a great gaunt wolf all torn to pieces and covered with blood  Too late, Llewelyn learned what had happened while he was away', " Gellert had stayed behind to guard the child and had fought and slain the wolf that had tried to destroy Llewelyn's heir", " In vain was all Llewelyn's grief; he could not bring his faithful dog to life again", ' So he buried him outside the castle walls within sight of the great mountain of Snowdon, where every passer-by might see his grave, and raised over it a great cairn of stones  And to this day the place is called Beth Gellert, or the Grave of Gellert      Far away in the country lay an old manor-house where lived an old squire who had two sons  They thought themselves so clever, that if they had known only half of what they did know, it would have been quite enough', " They both wanted to marry the King's daughter, for she had proclaimed that she would have for her husband the man who knew best how to choose his words", ' Both prepared for the wooing a whole week, which was the longest time allowed them; but, after all, it was quite long enough, for they both had preparatory knowledge, and everyone knows how useful that is', " One knew the whole Latin dictionary and also three years' issue of the daily paper of the town off by heart, so that he could repeat it all backwards or forwards as you pleased", ' The other had worked at the laws of corporation, and knew by heart what every member of the corporation ought to know, so that he thought he could quite well speak on State matters and give his opinion  He understood, besides this, how to embroider braces with roses and other flowers, and scrolls, for he was very ready with his fingers', " 'I shall win the king's daughter!' they both cried", ' Their old father gave each of them a fine horse; the one who knew the dictionary and the daily paper by heart had a black horse, while the other who was so clever at corporation law had a milk-white one  Then they oiled the corners of their mouths so that they might be able to speak more fluently', " All the servants stood in the courtyard and saw them mount their steeds, and here by chance came the third brother; for the squire had three sons, but nobody counted him with his brothers, for he was not so learned as they were, and he was generally called 'Blockhead-Hans", "' 'Oh, oh!' said Blockhead-Hans", " 'Where are you off to? You are in your Sunday-best clothes!' 'We are going to Court, to woo the Princess! Don't you know what is known throughout all the country side?' And they told him all about it", " 'Hurrah! I'll go to!' cried Blockhead-Hans; and the brothers laughed at him and rode off", " 'Dear father!' cried Blockhead-Hans, 'I must have a horse too", " What a desire for marriage has seized me! If she will have me, she WILL have me, and if she won't have me, I will have her", "' 'Stop that nonsense!' said the old man", " 'I will not give you a horse", " YOU can't speak; YOU don't know how to choose your words", " Your brothers! Ah! they are very different lads!' 'Well,' said Blockhead-Hans, 'if I can't have a horse, I will take the goat which is mine; he can carry me!' And he did so", ' He sat astride on the goat, struck his heels into its side, and went rattling down the high-road like a hurricane', " 'Hoppetty hop! what a ride!' Here I come!' shouted Blockhead-Hans, singing so that the echoes were roused far and near", ' But his brothers were riding slowly in front  They were not speaking, but they were thinking over all the good things they were going to say, for everything had to be thought out', " 'Hullo!' bawled Blockhead-Hans, 'here I am! Just look what I found on the road!'--and he showed them a dead crow which he had picked up", " 'Blockhead!' said his brothers, 'what are you going to do with it?' 'With the crow? I shall give it to the Princess!' 'Do so, certainly!' they said, laughing loudly and riding on", " 'Slap! bang! here I am again! Look what I have just found! You don't find such things every day on the road!' And the brothers turned round to see what in the world he could have found", " 'Blockhead!' said they, 'that is an old wooden shoe without the top! Are you going to send that, too, to the Princess?' 'Of course I shall!' returned Blockhead-Hans; and the brothers laughed and rode on a good way", " 'Slap! bang! here I am!' cried Blockhead-Hans; 'better and better--it is really famous!' 'What have you found now?' asked the brothers", " 'Oh,' said Blockhead-Hans, 'it is really too good! How pleased the Princess will be!' 'Why!' said the brothers, 'this is pure mud, straight from the ditch" ,  ' There was a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all over with gold  But this man had the misfortune to have a blue beard, which made him so frightfully ugly, that all the women and girls ran away from him  One of his neighbours, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties  He desired of her one of them in marriage, leaving to her the choice which of the two she would bestow upon him  They would neither of them have him, and each made the other welcome of him, being not able to bear the thought of marrying a man who had a blue beard  And what besides gave them disgust and aversion, was his having already been married to several wives, and nobody ever knew what became of them  Blue Beard, to engage their affection, took them, with the lady their mother, and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, with other young people of the neighbourhood, to one of his country seats, where they stayed a whole week  There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth and feasting  Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in playing tricks upon each other  In short, every thing succeeded so well, that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue, and that he was a mighty civil gentleman  As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded  About a month afterwards Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, about affairs of very great consequence, desiring her to divert herself in his absence, to send for her friends and acquaintances, to carry them into the country, if she pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was  "Here," said he, "are the keys of the two great wardrobes, wherein I have my best furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which is not every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments  But for this little one here, it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor  Open them all; go into all and every one of them; except that little closet which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a manner that, if you happen to open it, there will be no bounds to my just anger and resentment " She promised to observe, very exactly, whatever he had ordered; when he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey  Her neighbours and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the newmarried lady, so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard which frightened them', " They ran thro' all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all so rich and fine, that they seemed to surpass one another", ' After that, they went up into the two great rooms, where were the best and richest furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking-glasses in which you might see yourself from head to foot; some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the finest and most magnificent which were ever seen  They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend, who in the mean time no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things, because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet of the ground floor  She was so much pressed by her curiosity, that, without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company, she went down a little back-stair-case, and with such excessive haste, that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck', " Being come to the closet door, she made a stop for some time, thinking upon her husband's orders, and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it", ' She took then the little key, and opened it trembling; but could not at first see any thing plainly, because the windows were shut  After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood, in which were reflected the bodies of several dead women ranged against the walls: these were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered one after another  She was like to have died for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand  After having somewhat recovered her senses, she took up the key, locked the door, and went up stairs into her chamber to recover herself; but she could not, so much was she frightened  Having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off, but the blood would not come off; in vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand, the blood still remained, for the key was a Fairy, and she could never make it quite clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other  Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said, he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage  His wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return  Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand, that he easily guessed what had happened' ,  "In Treneglwys there is a certain shepherd's cot known by the name of Twt y Cymrws because of the strange strife that occurred there", ' There once lived there a man and his wife, and they had twins whom the woman nursed tenderly  One day she was called away to the house of a neighbour at some distance  She did not much like going and leaving her little ones all alone in a solitary house, especially as she had heard tell of the good folk haunting the neighbourhood  Well, she went and came back as soon as she could, but on her way back she was frightened to see some old elves of the blue petticoat crossing her path though it was midday  She rushed home, but found her two little ones in the cradle and everything seemed as it was before', " But after a time the good people began to suspect that something was wrong, for the twins didn't grow at all", ' The man said: "They\'re not ours " The woman said: "Whose else should they be?" And so arose the great strife so that the neighbours named the cottage after it  It made the woman very sad, so one evening she made up her mind to go and see the Wise Man of Llanidloes, for he knew everything and would advise her what to do  So she went to Llanidloes and told the case to the Wise Man  Now there was soon to be a harvest of rye and oats, so the Wise Man said to her, "When you are getting dinner for the reapers, clear out the shell of a hen\'s egg and boil some potage in it, and then take it to the door as if you meant it as a dinner for the reapers  Then listen if the twins say anything  If you hear them speaking of things beyond the understanding of children, go back and take them up and throw them into the waters of Lake Elvyn', " But if you don't hear anything remarkable, do them no injury", '" So when the day of the reap came the woman did all that the Wise Man ordered, and put the eggshell on the fire and took it off and carried it to the door, and there she stood and listened  Then she heard one of the children say to the other:  Acorn before oak I knew,   An egg before a hen,  But I never heard of an eggshell brew   A dinner for harvest men  So she went back into the house, seized the children and threw them into the Llyn, and the goblins in their blue trousers came and saved their dwarfs and the mother had her own children back and so the great strife ended      Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who had no children; and this they lamented very much  But one day, as the queen was walking by the side of the river, a little fish lifted its head out of the water, and said, "Your wish shall be fulfilled, and you shall soon have a daughter " What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl who was so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on her for joy, and determined to hold a great feast  So he invited not only his relations, friends, and neighbors, but also all the fairies, that they might be kind and good to his little daughter  Now there were thirteen fairies in his kingdom, and he had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, so that he was obliged to leave one of the fairies without an invitation  The rest came, and after the feast was over they gave all their best gifts to the little princess; one gave her virtue, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was excellent in the world  When eleven had done blessing her, the thirteenth, who had not been invited, and was very angry on that account, came in, and determined to take her revenge  So she cried out, "The king\'s daughter shall in her fifteenth year be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead " Then the twelfth, who had not yet given her gift, came forward and said that the bad wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften it, and that the king\'s daughter should not die, but fall asleep for a hundred years  But the king hoped to save his dear child from the threatened evil, and ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and destroyed', " All the fairies' gifts were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful, and well-behaved and amiable, and wise, that every one who knew her loved her", ' Now it happened that on the very day she was fifteen years old the king and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace  So she roamed about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door  In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily  "Why, how now, good mother," said the princess, "what are you doing there?" "Spinning," said the old lady, and nodded her head  "How prettily that little thing turns round!" said the princess, and took the spindle and began to spin  But scarcely had she touched it before the prophecy was fulfilled, and she fell down lifeless on the ground  However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen, who just then came home, and all their court, fell asleep too, and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the yard, and the pigeons on the house-top, and the flies on the walls  Even the fire on the I hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; and the meat that was roasting stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; and so everything stood still, and slept soundly  A high hedge of thorns soon grew around the palace, and every year it became higher and thicker, till at last the whole palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen', " But there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose, for thus was the king's daughter called; so that from time to time several kings' sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the palace", ' This they could never do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them as it were with hands, and there they stuck fast and died miserably', " After many, many years there came another king's son into that land, and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns, and how a beautiful palace stood behind it, in which was a wondrous princess, called Briar Rose, asleep with all her court", ' He told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but had stuck fast and died  Then the young prince said, "All this shall not frighten me; I will go and see Briar Rose " The old man tried to dissuade him, but he persisted in going  Now that very day the hundred years were completed; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he passed with ease, and they closed after him as firm as ever  Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the yard lay the dogs asleep, and the horses in the stables, and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep with their heads under their wings; and when he came into the palace, the flies slept on the walls, and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand as if she would beat the boy, and the maid sat with a black fowl in her hand ready to be plucked  Then he went on still further, and all was so still that he could hear every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower and opened the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was, and there she lay fast asleep, and looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off, and he stooped down and gave her a kiss  But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him There was once a young shepherd who wanted very much to marry, and was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty, so that it was difficult for him to make a choice, and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them  Then he asked his mother for advice, and she said, invite all three, and set some cheese before them, and watch how they eat it  The youth did so, the first swallowed the cheese with the rind on, the second hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw that away also, the third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut neither too much nor too little  The shepherd told all this to his mother, who said, take the third for your wife  This he did, and lived contentedly and happily with her   Little brother took his little sister by the hand and said, since our mother died we have had no happiness  Our step-mother beats us every day, and if we come near her she kicks us away with her foot  Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over  And the little dog under the table is better off, for she often throws it a choice morsel  God pity us, if our mother only knew  Come, we will go forth together into the wide world  They walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony places  And when it rained the little sister said, heaven and our hearts are weeping together  In the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep  The next day when they awoke, the sun was already high in the sky, and shone down hot into the tree  Then the brother said, sister, I am thirsty  If I knew of a little brook I would go and just take a drink  I think I hear one running  The brother got up and took the little sister by the hand, and they set off to find the brook  But the wicked step-mother was a witch, and had seen how the two children had gone away, and had crept after them secretly, as witches creep, and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest  Now when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the stones, the brother was going to drink out of it, but the sister heard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a tiger  Who drinks of me will be a tiger  Then the sister cried, pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and tear me to pieces  The brother did not drink, although he was so thirsty, but said, I will wait for the next spring  When they came to the next brook the sister heard this also say, who drinks of me will be a wolf  Who drinks of me will be a wolf  Then the sister cried out, pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wolf, and devour me  The brother did not drink, and said, I will wait until we come to the next spring, but then I must drink, say what you like  For my thirst is too great  And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a roebuck  Who drinks of me will be a roebuck  The sister said, oh, I pray you, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a roebuck, and run away from me  But the brother had knelt down at once by the brook, and had bent down and drunk some of the water, and as soon as the first drops touched his lips he lay there in the form of a young roebuck  And now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother, and the little roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her  But at last the girl said, be quiet, dear little roe, I will never, never leave you There was one upon a time a great war, and when it came to an end, many soldiers were discharged  Then brother lustig also received his dismissal, and with it nothing but a small loaf of ammunition-bread, and four kreuzers in money, with which he departed  St  Peter, however, had placed himself in his way in the form of a poor beggar, and when brother lustig came up, he begged alms of him  Brother lustig replied, dear beggar-man, what am I to give you  I have been a soldier, and have received my dismissal, and have nothing but this little loaf of ammunition-bread, and four kreuzers of money  When that is gone, I shall have to beg as well as you  Still I will give you something  Thereupon he divided the loaf into four parts, and gave the apostle one of them, and a kreuzer likewise  St', " Peter thanked him, went onwards, and threw himself again in the soldier's way as a beggar, but in another shape, and when he came up begged a gift of him as before", ' Brother lustig spoke as he had done before, and again gave him a quarter of the loaf and one kreuzer  St  Peter thanked him, and went onwards, but for the third time placed himself in another shape as a beggar in the road, and spoke to brother lustig  Brother lustig gave him also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer  St  Peter thanked him, and brother lustig went onwards, and had but a quarter of the loaf, and one kreuzer', " With that he went into an inn, ate the bread, and ordered one kreuzer's worth of beer", ' When he had had it, he journeyed onwards, and then St  Peter, who had assumed the appearance of a discharged soldier, met and spoke to him thus  Good day, comrade, can you not give me a bit of bread, and a kreuzer to get a drink  Where am I to procure it, answered brother lustig  I have been discharged, and I got nothing but a loaf of ammunition-bread and four kreuzers in money  I met three beggars on the road, and I gave each of them a quarter of my bread, and one kreuzer  The last quarter I ate in the inn, and had a drink with the last kreuzer  Now my pockets are empty, and if you also have nothing we can go a-begging together  No, answered St  Peter, we need not quite do that  I know a little about medicine, and I will soon earn as much as I require by that  Indeed, said brother lustig, I know nothing of that, so I must go and beg alone' ,  " BROTHER took sister by the hand and said: 'Look here; we haven't had one single happy hour since our mother died", ' That stepmother of ours beats us regularly every day, and if we dare go near her she kicks us away  We never get anything but hard dry crusts to eat--why, the dog under the table is better off than we are  She does throw him a good morsel or two now and then  Oh dear! if our own dear mother only knew all about it! Come along, and let us go forth into the wide world together', "' So off they started through fields and meadows, over hedges and ditches, and walked the whole day long, and when it rained sister said: 'Heaven and our hearts are weeping together", "' Towards evening they came to a large forest, and were so tired out with hunger and their long walk, as well as all their trouble, that they crept into a hollow tree and soon fell fast asleep", ' Next morning, when they woke up, the sun was already high in the heavens and was shining down bright and warm into the tree', " Then said brother: 'I'm so thirsty, sister; if I did but know where to find a little stream, I'd go and have a drink", ' I do believe I hear one', "' He jumped up, took sister by the hand, and they set off to hunt for the brook", ' Now their cruel stepmother was in reality a witch, and she knew perfectly well that the two children had run away  She had crept secretly after them, and had cast her spells over all the streams in the forest', " Presently the children found a little brook dancing and glittering over the stones, and brother was eager to drink of it, but as it rushed past sister heard it murmuring: 'Who drinks of me will be a tiger! who drinks of me will be a tiger!' So she cried out, 'Oh! dear brother, pray don't drink, or you'll be turned into a wild beast and tear me to pieces", "' Brother was dreadfully thirsty, but he did not drink", " 'Very well,' said he, 'I'll wait till we come to the next spring", "' When they came to the second brook, sister heard it repeating too: 'Who drinks of me will be a wolf I who drinks of me will be a wolf!' And she cried, 'Oh! brother, pray don't drink here either, or you'll be turned into a wolf and eat me up", "' Again brother did not drink, but he said: 'Well, I'll wait a little longer till we reach the next stream, but then, whatever you may say, I really must drink, for I can bear this thirst no longer", "' And when they got to the third brook, sister heard it say as it rushed past: 'Who drinks of me will be a roe! who drinks of me will be a roe!' And she begged, 'Ah! brother, don't drink yet, or you'll become a roe and run away from me", "' But her brother was already kneeling by the brook and bending over it to drink, and, sure enough, no sooner had his lips touched the water than he fell on the grass transformed into a little Roebuck", ' Sister cried bitterly over her poor bewitched brother, and the little Roe wept too, and sat sadly by her side', " At last the girl said: 'Never mind, dear little fawn, I will never forsake you,' and she took off her golden garter and tied it round the Roe's neck", ' Then she plucked rushes and plaited a soft cord of them, which she fastened to the collar  When she had done this she led the Roe farther and farther, right into the depths of the forest', " After they had gone a long, long way they came to a little house, and when the girl looked into it she found it was quite empty, and she thought 'perhaps we might stay and live here", "' So she hunted up leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the little Roe, and every morning and evening she went out and gathered roots, nuts, and berries for herself, and tender young grass for the fawn", ' And he fed from her hand, and played round her and seemed quite happy', " In the evening, when sister was tired, she said her prayers and then laid her head on the fawn's back and fell sound asleep with it as a pillow", ' And if brother had but kept his natural form, really it would have been a most delightful kind of life  They had been living for some time in the forest in this way, when it came to pass that the King of that country had a great hunt through the woods  THERE was once on a time a widower who had a son and a daughter by his first wife  They were both good children, and loved each other with all their hearts  After some time had gone by the man married again, and he chose a widow with one daughter who was ugly and wicked, and her mother was ugly and wicked too', " From the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children, and not a corner to be found where they could get any rest; so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to go out into the world and try to earn his own bread", " When he had roamed about for some time he came to the King's palace, where he obtained a place under the coachman; and very brisk and active he was, and the horses that he looked after were so fat and sleek, that they shone again", ' But his sister, who was still at home, fared worse and worse', " Both her step-mother and her step-sister were always finding fault with her, whatsoever she did and whithersoever she went, and they scolded her and abused her so that she never had an hour's peace", ' They made her do all the hard work, and hard words fell to her lot early and late, but little enough food accompanied them', " One day they sent her to the brook to fetch some water home, and an ugly and horrible head rose up out of the water, and said, 'Wash me, girl!' 'Yes, I will wash you with pleasure,' said the girl, and began to wash and scrub the ugly face, but she couldn't help thinking that it was a very unpleasant piece of work", ' When she had done it, and done it well, another head rose up out of the water, and this one was uglier still', " 'Brush me, girl!' said the head", " 'Yes, I will brush you with pleasure,' said the girl, and set to work with the tangled hair, and, as may be easily imagined, this too was by no means pleasant work", ' When she had got it done, another and a much more ugly and horrible-looking head rose up out of the water', " 'Kiss me, girl!' said the head", " 'Yes, I will kiss you,' said the man's daughter, and she did it, but she thought it was the worst bit of work that she had ever had to do in her life", ' So the heads all began to talk to each other, and to ask what they should do for this girl who was so full of kindliness', " 'She shall be the prettiest girl that ever was, and fair and bright as the day,' said the first head", " 'Gold shall drop from her hair whenever she brushes it,' said the second", " 'Gold shall drop from her mouth whenever she speaks,' said the third head", " So when the man's daughter went home, looking as beautiful and bright as day, the step-mother and her daughter grew much more ill-tempered, and it was worse still when she began to talk, and they saw that golden coins dropped from her mouth", " The step-mother fell into such a towering passion that she drove the man's daughter into the pig-stye--she might stay there with her fine show of gold, the step-mother said, but she should not be permitted to set foot in the house", ' It was not long before the mother wanted her own daughter to go to the stream to fetch some water  When she got there with her pails, the first head rose up out of the water close to the bank', " 'Wash me, girl!' it said", " 'Wash yourself!' answered the woman's daughter", ' Then the second head appeared', " 'Brush me, girl!' said the head", " 'Brush yourself!' said the woman's daughter", ' So down it went to the bottom, and the third head came up', " 'Kiss me, girl!' said the head" ,  'A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together  But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger, said the cat, and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day  The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it  At length, after much consideration, the cat said, I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there  We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it  So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse, I want to tell you something, little mouse, my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother, he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening  Let me go out to-day, and you look after the house by yourself  Yes, yes, answered the mouse, by all means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me, I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself  All this, however, was untrue, the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother  She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off  Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home  Well, here you are again, said the mouse, no doubt you have had a merry day  All went off well, answered the cat  What name did they give the child  Top off, said the cat quite coolly  Top off, cried the mouse, that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family  What does that matter, said the cat, it is no worse than crumb-stealer, as your God-children are called  Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning  She said to the mouse, you must do me a favor, and once more manage the house for a day alone  I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse  The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat', " Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself, said she, and was quite satisfied with her day's work", ' When she went home the mouse inquired, and what was this child christened  Half-done, answered the cat  Half-done  What are you saying', " I never heard the name in my life, I'll wager anything it is not in the calendar", " The cat's mouth soon began to water for some more licking", ' All good things go in threes, said she, I am asked to stand godmother again', " The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body, this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won't you" ,  ' Once upon a time there was a youth named Frederick and a girl called Catherine, who had married and lived together as a young couple  One day Fred said, "I am now going into the fields, dear Catherine, and by the time I return let there be something hot upon the table, for I shall be hungry, and something to drink, too, for I shall be thirsty " "Very well, dear Fred," said she, "go at once, and I will make all right for you " As soon, then, as dinner-time approached, she took down a sausage out of the chimney, and putting it in a frying-pan with batter, set it over the fire  Soon the sausage began to frizzle and spit while Catherine stood by holding the handle of the pan and thinking; and among other things she thought that while the sausage was getting ready she might go into the cellar and draw some beer  So she took a can and went down into the cellar to draw the beer, and while it ran into the can, she bethought herself that perhaps the dog might steal the sausage out of the pan, and so up the cellar stairs she ran, but too late, for the rogue had already got the meat in his mouth and was sneaking off  Catherine, however, pursued the dog for a long way over the fields, but the beast was quicker than she, and would not let the sausage go, but bolted off at a great rate  "Off is off!" said Catherine, and turned round, and being very tired and hot, she went home slowly to cool herself  All this while the beer was running out of the cask, for Catherine had forgotten to turn the tap off, and so, as soon as the can was full, the liquor ran over the floor of the cellar until it was all out  Catherine saw the misfortune at the top of the steps  "My gracious!" she exclaimed; "what shall I do that Fred may not find this out?" She considered for some time till she remembered that a sack of fine malt yet remained from the last brewing, in one corner, which she would fetch down and strew about in the beer  "Yes," said she, "it was spared at the right time to be useful to me now in my necessity"; and down she pulled the sack so hastily that she overturned the can of beer for Fred, and away it mixed with the rest on the floor  "It is all right," said she, "where one is, the other should be," and she strewed the malt over the whole cellar  When it was done she was quite overjoyed at her work, and said, "How clean and neat it does look, to be sure!" At noontime Fred returned  "Now, wife, what have you ready for me?" said he  "Ah, my dear Fred," she replied, "I would have fried you a sausage, but while I drew the beer the dog stole it out of the pan, and while I hunted the dog the beer all ran out, and as I was about to dry up the beer with the malt I overturned your can; but be contented, the cellar is quite dry again now " "Oh, Catherine, Catherine!" said Fred; "you should not have done so! to let the sausage be stolen! and the beer run out! and over all to shoot our best sack of malt!" "Well, Fred," said she, "I did not know that; you should have told me " But the husband thought to himself, if one\'s wife acts so, one must look after things oneself  Now, he had collected a tolerable sum of silver dollars, which he changed into gold, and then he told his wife, "Do you see, these are yellow counters which I will put in a pot and bury in the stable under the cow\'s stall; but mind that you do not meddle with it, or you will come to some harm " Catherine promised to mind what he said, but as soon as Fred was gone some hawkers came into the village with earthenware for sale, and amongst others they asked her if she would purchase anything  "Ah, good people," said Catherine, "I have no money, and cannot buy anything, but if you can make use of yellow counters I will buy them " "Yellow counters! ah! why not? Let us look at them," said they  "Go into the stable," she replied, "and dig under the cows stall, and there you will find the yellow counters  I dare not go myself " The rogues went at once, and soon dug up the shining gold which they quickly pocketed, and then they ran off, leaving behind them their pots and dishes in the house  Catherine thought she might as well make use of the new pottery, and since she had no need of anything in the kitchen, she set out each pot on the ground, and then put others on the top of the palings round the house for ornament  When Fred returned, and saw the fresh decorations, he asked Catherine what she had done  "I have bought them, Fred," said she, "with the yellow counters which lay under the cow\'s stall; but I did not dig them up myself; the pedlars did that " "Ah, wife, what have you done?" replied Fred  "They were not counters, but bright gold, which was all the property we possessed: you should not have done so  Long ago there lived a rich merchant who, besides possessing more treasures than any king in the world, had in his great hall three chairs, one of silver, one of gold, and one of diamonds  But his greatest treasure of all was his only daughter, who was called Catherine  One day Catherine was sitting in her own room when suddenly the door flew open, and in came a tall and beautiful woman holding in her hands a little wheel', " 'Catherine,' she said, going up to the girl, 'which would you rather have-a happy youth or a happy old age?' Catherine was so taken by surprise that she did not know what to answer, and the lady repeated again, 'Which would you rather have-a happy youth or a happy old age?' Then Catherine thought to herself, 'If I say a happy youth, then I shall have to suffer all the rest of my life", ' No, I would bear trouble now, and have something better to look forward to', "' So she looked up and replied, 'Give me a happy old age", "' 'So be it,' said the lady, and turned her wheel as she spoke, vanishing the next moment as suddenly as she had come", ' Now this beautiful lady was the Destiny of poor Catherine  Only a few days after this the merchant heard the news that all his finest ships, laden with the richest merchandise, had been sunk in a storm, and he was left a beggar  The shock was too much for him  He took to his bed, and in a short time he was dead of his disappointment  So poor Catherine was left alone in the world without a penny or a creature to help her  But she was a brave girl and full of spirit, and soon made up her mind that the best thing she could do was to go to the nearest town and become a servant', " She lost no time in getting herself ready, and did not take long over her journey; and as she was passing down the chief street of the town a noble lady saw her out of the window, and, struck by her sad face, said to her: 'Where are you going all alone, my pretty girl?' 'Ah, my lady, I am very poor, and must go to service to earn my bread", "' 'I will take you into my service,' said she; and Catherine served her well", " Some time after her mistress said to Catherine, 'I am obliged to go out for a long while, and must lock the house door, so that no thieves shall get in", "' So she went away, and Catherine took her work and sat down at the window", ' Suddenly the door burst open, and in came her Destiny', " 'Oh! so here you are, Catherine! Did you really think I was going to leave you in peace?' And as she spoke she walked to the linen press where Catherine's mistress kept all her finest sheets and underclothes, tore everything in pieces, and flung them on the floor", " Poor Catherine wrung her hands and wept, for she thought to herself, 'When my lady comes back and sees all this ruin she will think it is my fault,' and starting up, she fled through the open door", ' Then Destiny took all the pieces and made them whole again, and put them back in the press, and when everything was tidy she too left the house  When the mistress reached home she called Catherine, but no Catherine was there', " 'Can she have robbed me?' thought the old lady, and looked hastily round the house; but nothing was missing", ' She wondered why Catherine should have disappeared like this, but she heard no more of her, and in a few days she filled her place  Meanwhile Catherine wandered on and on, without knowing very well where she was going, till at last she came to another town', " Just as before, a noble lady happened to see her passing her window, and called out to her, 'Where are you going all alone, my pretty girl?' And Catherine answered, 'Ah, my lady, I am very poor, and must go to service to earn my bread", "' 'I will take you into my service,' said the lady; and Catherine served her well, and hoped she might now be left in peace", " But, exactly as before, one day that Catherine was left in the house alone her Destiny came again and spoke to her with hard words: 'What! are you here now?' And in a passion she tore up everything she saw, till in sheer misery poor Catherine rushed out of the house", ' And so it befell for seven years, and directly Catherine found a fresh place her Destiny came and forced her to leave it  After seven years, however, Destiny seemed to get tired of persecuting her, and a time of peace set in for Catherine \tCinderella The wife of a rich man fell sick, and as she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, dear child, be good and pious, and then the good God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you  Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed', " Every day the maiden went out to her mother's grave, and wept, and she remained pious and good", ' When winter came the snow spread a white sheet over the grave, and by the time the spring sun had drawn it off again, the man had taken another wife  The woman had brought with her into the house two daughters, who were beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart  Now began a bad time for the poor step-child  Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us, they said  He who wants to eat bread must earn it  Out with the kitchen-wench  They took her pretty clothes away from her, put an old grey bedgown on her, and gave her wooden shoes  Just look at the proud princess, how decked out she is, they cried, and laughed, and led her into the kitchen  There she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash  Besides this, the sisters did her every imaginable injury - they mocked her and emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was forced to sit and pick them out again  In the evening when she had worked till she was weary she had no bed to go to, but had to sleep by the hearth in the cinders  And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her cinderella  It happened that the father was once going to the fair, and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them  Beautiful dresses, said one, pearls and jewels, said the second  And you, cinderella, said he, what will you have  Father break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on your way home  So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for his two step-daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat  Then he broke off the branch and took it with him  When he reached home he gave his step-daughters the things which they had wished for, and to cinderella he gave the branch from the hazel-bush', " Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother's grave and planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell down on it and watered it", ' And it grew and became a handsome tree  Thrice a day cinderella went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a little white bird always came on the tree, and if cinderella expressed a wish, the bird threw down to her what she had wished for  It happened, however, that the king gave orders for a festival which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited, in order that his son might choose himself a bride', " When the two step-sisters heard that they too were to appear among the number, they were delighted, called cinderella and said, comb our hair for us, brush our shoes and fasten our buckles, for we are going to the wedding at the king's palace", ' Cinderella obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to go with them to the dance, and begged her step-mother to allow her to do so  You go, cinderella, said she, covered in dust and dirt as you are, and would go to the festival  You have no clothes and shoes, and yet would dance  The wife of a rich man fell sick: and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bedside, and said, "Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you " Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her  And the snow spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife  This new wife had two daughters of her own: they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl  "What does the good-for-nothing thing want in the parlor?" said they; and they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old frock to put on, and laughed at her and turned her into the kitchen  Then she was forced to do hard work; to rise early, before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash  She had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes, and they called her Cinderella', " It happened once that her father was going to the fair, and asked his wife's daughters what he should bring to them", ' "Fine clothes," said the first  "Pearls and diamonds," said the second  "Now, child," said he to his own daughter, "what will you have?" "The first sprig, dear father, that rubs against your hat on your way home," said she  Then he bought for the two first the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a sprig of hazel brushed against him, so he broke it off and when he got home he gave it to his daughter', " Then she took it, and went to her mother's grave and planted it there, and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree, and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for", " Now it happened that the king of the land held a feast which was to last three days, and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself; and Cinderella's two sisters were asked to come", ' So they called Cinderella, and said, "Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king\'s feast " Then she did as she was told, but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she would have liked to go to the dance too, and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go, "You! Cinderella?" said she; "you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to the ball?" And when she kept on begging, to get rid of her, she said at last, "I will throw this basinful of peas into the ash heap, and if you have picked them all out in two hours\' time you shall go to the feast too " Then she threw the peas into the ashes; but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out--  "Hither, thither, through the sky, turtle-doves and linnets, fly!  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay, hither, thither, haste away!  One and all, come, help me quick! haste ye, haste ye--pick, pick,  pick!" Then first came two white doves; and next two turtle-doves; and after them all the little birds under heaven came, and the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick, and picked out all the good grain and put it into a dish, and left the ashes  At the end of one hour the work was done, and all flew out again at the windows  Then she brought the dish to her mother  But the mother said, "No, no! indeed, you have no clothes and cannot dance; you shall not go " And when Cinderella begged very hard to go, she said, "If you can in one hour\'s time pick two of these dishes of pease out of the ashes, you shall go too " So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes; but the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and called as before and all the birds came flying, and in half an hour\'s time all was done, and out they flew again  And then Cinderella took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball  But her mother said, "It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance; and you would only put us to shame;" and off she went with her two daughters to the feast  Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Cinderella went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out--  "Shake, shake, hazel-tree, gold and silver over me!" Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast  But they did not know her, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes  The king\'s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her and no one else; and he never left her hand, but when any one else came to ask her to dance, he said, "This lady is dancing with me " Thus they danced till a late hour of the night, and then she wanted to go home; and the king\'s son said, "I shall go and take care of you to your home," for he wanted to see where the beautiful maid lived  But she slipped away from him unawares, and ran off towards home, and the prince followed her; then she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the door  So he waited till her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden who had been at the feast had hidden herself in the pigeon-house  Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen  She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own humour and they were indeed exactly like her in all things  He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world  No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over, but the stepmother began to shew herself in her colours  She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl; and the less, because they made her own daughters appear the more odious  She employed her in the meanest work of the house; she scoured the dishes, tables, &c', " and rubbed Madam's chamber, and those of Misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw-bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large, that they might see themselves at their full length, from head to foot", ' The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him intirely  When she had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinder-breech; but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderilla', " However, Cinderilla, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, tho' they were always dressed very richly", " It happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all persons of fashion to it", ' Our young misses were also invited; for they cut a very grand figure among the quality  They were mightily delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in chusing out such gowns, petticoats, and head-clothes as might best become them', " This was a new trouble to Cinderilla; for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen, and plaited their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed", ' "For my part," said the eldest, "I will wear my red velvet suit, with French trimming " "And I," said the youngest, "shall only have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world " They sent for the best tire-woman they could get, to make up their head-dresses, and adjust their double-pinners, and they had their red brushes, and patches from the fashionable maker   Cinderilla was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the best, nay and offered her service to dress their heads, which they were very willing she should do  As she was doing this, they said to her: "Cinderilla, would you not be glad to go to the ball?" "Ah!" said she, "you only jeer at me; it is not for such as I am to go thither " "Thou art in the right of it," replied they, "it would make the people laugh to see a Cinder-breech at a ball " Any one but Cinderilla would have dressed their heads awry, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well  They were almost two days without eating, so much they were transported with joy; they broke above a dozen of laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass  At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderilla followed them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them she fell a-crying  Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter  "I wish I could----, I wish I could--;" she was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing  This godmother of hers, who was a Fairy, said to her: "Thou wishest thou couldest go to the ball, is it not so?" "Y--es," cried Cinderilla, with a great sigh  "Well," said her godmother, "be but a good girl, and I will contrive that thou shalt go " Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her: "Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin " Cinderilla went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball  Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, leaving nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold There was once a man who had a daughter who was called clever elsie  And when she had grown up her father said, we will get her married  Yes, said the mother, if only someone would come who would have her  At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans, but he stipulated that clever elsie should be really smart  Oh, said the father, she has plenty of good sense  And the mother said, oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing', " Well, said Hans, if she is not really smart, I won't have her", ' When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said, elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer  Then clever elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear long  When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury  Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there  Then clever elsie began to weep, and said, if I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him  Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her  Those upstairs waited for the drink, but clever elsie still did not come  Then the woman said to the servant, just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is  The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly  Elsie, why do you weep, asked the maid  Ah, she answered, have I not reason to weep  If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him  Then said the maid, what a clever elsie we have  And sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune  After a while, as the maid did not come back, those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy, just go down into the cellar and see where elsie and the girl are  The boy went down, and there sat clever elsie and the girl both weeping together  Then he asked, why are you weeping, ah, said elsie, have I not reason to weep  If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him  Then said the boy, what a clever elsie we have  And sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly  Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman, just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is  The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause, then elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down  Then said the mother likewise, what a clever elsie we have There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought, you certainly are a pretty girl  And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said, the cook must know what the food is like  It came to pass that the master one day said to her, Gretel, there is a guest coming this evening  Prepare me two fowls very daintily  I will see to it, master, answered Gretel  She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast  The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived  Then Gretel called out to her master, if the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest  The master said, I will run myself, and fetch the guest  When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought, standing so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty  Who knows when they will come  Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink  She ran down, set a jug, said, God bless it for you, Gretel, and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught  Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round  But as the roast meat smelt so good, Gretel thought, something must be wrong, it ought to be tasted  She touched it with her finger, and said, ah, how good fowls are  It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time  She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought, one of the wings is burning  I had better take it off and eat it  So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought, the other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing  When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him  It suddenly occurred to her, who knows  They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere  Then she said, well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely', " When it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God's good gifts be spoilt", ' So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee  When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said, where one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together', " What's right for the one is right for the other", ' I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm  So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first The mother of Hans said, whither away, Hans  Hans answered, to Gretel  Behave well, Hans', " Oh, I'll behave well", ' Good-bye, mother  Good-bye, Hans  Hans comes to Gretel  Good day, Gretel  Good day, Hans  What do you bring that is good  I bring nothing, I want to have something given me  Gretel presents Hans with a needle  Hans says, good-bye, Gretel  Good-bye, Hans  Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart home  Good evening, mother  Good evening, Hans  Where have you been  With Gretel  What did you take her  Took her nothing, had something given me  What did Gretel give you  Gave me a needle  Where is the needle, Hans  Stuck it in the hay-cart  That was ill done, Hans  You should have stuck the needle in your sleeve', " Never mind, I'll do better next time", ' Whither away, Hans  To Gretel, mother  There was once a merchant who lived close to the royal palace, and had three daughters  They were all pretty, but Maria, the youngest, was the prettiest of the three  One day the king sent for the merchant, who was a widower, to give him directions about a journey he wished the good man to take', " The merchant would rather not have gone, as he did not like leaving his daughters at home, but he could not refuse to obey the king's commands, and with a heavy heart he returned home to say farewell to them", " Before he left, he took three pots of basil, and gave one to each girl, saying, 'I am going a journey, but I leave these pots", ' You must let nobody into the house  When I come back, they will tell me what has happened', "' 'Nothing will have happened,' said the girls", ' The father went away, and the following day the king, accompanied by two friends, paid a visit to the three girls, who were sitting at supper', " When they saw who was there, Maria said, 'Let us go and get a bottle of wine from the cellar", ' I will carry the key, my eldest sister can take the light, while the other brings the bottle', "' But the king replied, 'Oh, do not trouble; we are not thirsty", "' 'Very well, we will not go,' answered the two elder girls; but Maria merely said, 'I shall go, anyhow", "' She left the room, and went to the hall where she put out the light, and putting down the key and the bottle, ran to the house of a neighbour, and knocked at the door", " 'Who is there so late?' asked the old woman, thrusting her head out of the window", " 'Oh, let me in,' answered Maria", " 'I have quarrelled with my eldest sister, and as I do not want to fight any more, I have come to beg you to allow me to sleep with you", "' So the old woman opened the door and Maria slept in her house", ' The king was very angry at her for playing truant, but when she returned home the next day, she found the plants of her sisters withered away, because they had disobeyed their father  Now the window in the room of the eldest overlooked the gardens of the king, and when she saw how fine and ripe the medlars were on the trees, she longed to eat some, and begged Maria to scramble down by a rope and pick her a few, and she would draw her up again', " Maria, who was good-natured, swung herself into the garden by the rope, and got the medlars, and was just making the rope fast under her arms so as to be hauled up, when her sister cried: 'Oh, there are such delicious lemons a little farther on", ' You might bring me one or two', "' Maria turned round to pluck them, and found herself face to face with the gardener, who caught hold of her, exclaiming, 'What are you doing here, you little thief?' 'Don't call me names,' she said, 'or you will get the worst of it,' giving him as she spoke such a violent push that he fell panting into the lemon bushes", ' Then she seized the cord and clambered up to the window', " The next day the second sister had a fancy for bananas and begged so hard, that, though Maria had declared she would never do such a thing again, at last she consented, and went down the rope into the king's garden", " This time she met the king, who said to her, 'Ah, here you are again, cunning one! Now you shall pay for your misdeeds", "' And he began to cross-question her about what she had done", " Maria denied nothing, and when she had finished, the king said again, 'Follow me to the house, and there you shall pay the penalty", "' As he spoke, he started for the house, looking back from time to time to make sure that Maria had not run away", ' All of a sudden, when he glanced round, he found she had vanished completely, without leaving a trace of where she had gone Conall Yellowclaw was a sturdy tenant in Erin: he had three sons  There was at that time a king over every fifth of Erin  It fell out for the children of the king that was near Conall, that they themselves and the children of Conall came to blows', " The children of Conall got the upper hand, and they killed the king's big son", ' The king sent a message for Conall, and he said to him--"Oh, Conall! what made your sons go to spring on my sons till my big son was killed by your children? but I see that though I follow you revengefully, I shall not be much better for it, and I will now set a thing before you, and if you will do it, I will not follow you with revenge  If you and your sons will get me the brown horse of the king of Lochlann, you shall get the souls of your sons " "Why," said Conall, "should not I do the pleasure of the king, though there should be no souls of my sons in dread at all  Hard is the matter you require of me, but I will lose my own life, and the life of my sons, or else I will do the pleasure of the king " After these words Conall left the king, and he went home: when he got home he was under much trouble and perplexity  When he went to lie down he told his wife the thing the king had set before him  His wife took much sorrow that he was obliged to part from herself, while she knew not if she should see him more  "Oh, Conall," said she, "why didst not thou let the king do his own pleasure to thy sons, rather than be going now, while I know not if ever I shall see thee more?" When he rose on the morrow, he set himself and his three sons in order, and they took their journey towards Lochlann, and they made no stop but tore through ocean till they reached it  When they reached Lochlann they did not know what they should do  Said the old man to his sons, "Stop ye, and we will seek out the house of the king\'s miller " When they went into the house of the king\'s miller, the man asked them to stop there for the night', " Conall told the miller that his own children and the children of his king had fallen out, and that his children had killed the king's son, and there was nothing that would please the king but that he should get the brown horse of the king of Lochlann", ' "If you will do me a kindness, and will put me in a way to get him, for certain I will pay ye for it " "The thing is silly that you are come to seek," said the miller; "for the king has laid his mind on him so greatly that you will not get him in any way unless you steal him; but if you can make out a way, I will keep it secret " "This is what I am thinking," said Conall, "since you are working every day for the king, you and your gillies could put myself and my sons into five sacks of bran " "The plan that has come into your head is not bad," said the miller  The miller spoke to his gillies, and he said to them to do this, and they put them in five sacks', " The king's gillies came to seek the bran, and they took the five sacks with them, and they emptied them before the horses", ' The servants locked the door, and they went away  When they rose to lay hand on the brown horse, said Conall, "You shall not do that  It is hard to get out of this; let us make for ourselves five hiding holes, so that if they hear us we may go and hide " They made the holes, then they laid hands on the horse  The horse was pretty well unbroken, and he set to making a terrible noise through the stable  The king heard the noise  "It must be my brown horse," said he to his gillies; "find out what is wrong with him " The servants went out, and when Conall and his sons saw them coming they went into the hiding holes Connla of the Fiery Hair was son of Conn of the Hundred Fights  One day as he stood by the side of his father on the height of Usna, he saw a maiden clad in strange attire coming towards him  "Whence comest thou, maiden?" said Connla  "I come from the Plains of the Ever Living," she said, "there where there is neither death nor sin  There we keep holiday alway, nor need we help from any in our joy  And in all our pleasure we have no strife  And because we have our homes in the round green hills, men call us the Hill Folk " The king and all with him wondered much to hear a voice when they saw no one  For save Connla alone, none saw the Fairy Maiden  "To whom art thou talking, my son?" said Conn the king  Then the maiden answered, "Connla speaks to a young, fair maid, whom neither death nor old age awaits  I love Connla, and now I call him away to the Plain of Pleasure, Moy Mell, where Boadag is king for aye, nor has there been complaint or sorrow in that land since he has held the kingship  Oh, come with me, Connla of the Fiery Hair, ruddy as the dawn with thy tawny skin  A fairy crown awaits thee to grace thy comely face and royal form  Come, and never shall thy comeliness fade, nor thy youth, till the last awful day of judgment " The king in fear at what the maiden said, which he heard though he could not see her, called aloud to his Druid, Coran by name  "Oh, Coran of the many spells," he said, "and of the cunning magic, I call upon thy aid  A task is upon me too great for all my skill and wit, greater than any laid upon me since I seized the kingship  A maiden unseen has met us, and by her power would take from me my dear, my comely son', " If thou help not, he will be taken from thy king by woman's wiles and witchery", '" Then Coran the Druid stood forth and chanted his spells towards the spot where the maiden\'s voice had been heard  And none heard her voice again, nor could Connla see her longer', " Only as she vanished before the Druid's mighty spell, she threw an apple to Connla", ' For a whole month from that day Connla would take nothing, either to eat or to drink, save only from that apple  But as he ate it grew again and always kept whole  And all the while there grew within him a mighty yearning and longing after the maiden he had seen  But when the last day of the month of waiting came, Connla stood by the side of the king his father on the Plain of Arcomin, and again he saw the maiden come towards him, and again she spoke to him  "\'Tis a glorious place, forsooth, that Connla holds among short-lived mortals awaiting the day of death  But now the folk of life, the ever-living ones, beg and bid thee come to Moy Mell, the Plain of Pleasure, for they have learnt to know thee, seeing thee in thy home among thy dear ones " When Conn the king heard the maiden\'s voice he called to his men aloud and said: "Summon swift my Druid Coran, for I see she has again this day the power of speech  In the long time ago, Conchubar, son of Ness, was King of Ulster, and he held his court in the palace of Emain Macha  And this is the way he came to be King  He was but a young lad, and his father was not living, and Fergus, son of Rogh, who was at that time King of Ulster, asked his mother Ness in marriage  Now Ness, that was at one time the quietest and kindest of the women of Ireland, had got to be unkind and treacherous because of an unkindness that had been done to her, and she planned to get the kingdom away from Fergus for her own son  So she said to Fergus, "Let Conchubar hold the kingdom for a year, so that his children after him may be called the children of a king; and that is the marriage portion I will ask of you " "You may do that," the men of Ulster said to him; "for even though Conchubar gets the name of being king, it is yourself that will be our King all the time " So Fergus agreed to it, and he took Ness as his wife, and her son Conchubar was made King in his place  But all through the year Ness was working to keep the kingdom for him, and she gave great presents to the chief men of Ulster to get them on her side  And though Conchubar was but a young lad at the time, he was wise in his judgments and brave in battle, and good in shape and in form, and they liked him well  And at the end of the year, when Fergus asked to have the kingship back again, they consulted together; and it is what they agreed, that Conchubar was to keep it  And they said, "It is little Fergus thinks about us, when he was so ready to give up his rule over us for a year; and let Conchubar keep the kingship," they said, "and let Fergus keep the wife he has got " Now, it happened one day that Conchubar was making a feast at Emain Macha for the marriage of his sister Dechtire with Sualtim, son of Roig  And at the feast Dechtire was thirsty, and they gave her a cup of wine, and as she was drinking it a mayfly flew into the cup, and she drank it down with the wine  And presently she went into her sunny parlour, and her fifty maidens along with her, and she fell into a deep sleep  And in her sleep Lugh of the Long Hand appeared to her, and he said, "It is I myself was the mayfly that came to you in the cup, and it is with me you must come away now, and your fifty maidens along with you " And he put on them the appearance of a flock of birds, and they went with him southward till they came to Brugh na Boinne, the dwelling-place of the Sidhe  And no one at Emain Macha could get tale or tidings of them, or know where they had gone, or what had happened them  It was about a year after that time there was another feast in Emain, and Conchubar and his chief men were sitting at the feast  And suddenly they saw from the window a great flock of birds, that lit on the ground and began to eat up everything before them, so that not so much as a blade of grass was left  The men of Ulster were vexed when they saw the birds destroying all before them, and they yoked nine of their chariots to follow after them  Conchubar was in his own chariot, and there were following with him Fergus, son of Rogh, and Laegaire Buadach the Battle-Winner, and Celthair, son of Uithecar, and many others, and Bricriu of the bitter tongue was along with them  They followed after the birds across the whole country southward, across Slieve Fuad, by Ath Lethan, by Ath Garach and Magh Gossa, between Fir Rois and Fir Ardae; and the birds before them always  They were the most beautiful that had ever been seen; nine flocks of them there were, linked together two-and-two with a chain of silver, and at the head of every flock there were two birds of different colours, linked together with a chain of gold; and there were three birds that flew by themselves, and they all went before the chariots to the far end of the country, until the fall of night, and then there was no more seen of them  And when the dark night was coming on, Conchubar said to his people, "It is best for us to unyoke the chariots now, and to look for some place where we can spend the night " Then Fergus went forward to look for some place, and what he came to was a very small poor-looking house  A man and a woman were in it, and when they saw him they said, "Bring your companions here along with you, and they will be welcome " Fergus went back to his companions and told them what he had seen  But Bricriu said: "Where is the use of going into a house like that, with neither room nor provisions nor coverings in it; it is not worth our while to be going there " Then Bricriu went on himself to the place where the house was  But when he came to it, what he saw was a grand, new, well-lighted house; and at the door there was a young man wearing armour, very tall and handsome and shining  Curdie was as watchful as ever, but was almost getting tired of his ill success  Every other night or so he followed the goblins about, as they went on digging and boring, and getting as near them as he could, watched them from behind stones and rocks; but as yet he seemed no nearer finding out what they had in view', " As at first, he always kept hold of the end of his string, while his pickaxe, left just outside the hole by which he entered the goblins' country from the mine, continued to serve as an anchor and hold fast the other end", ' The goblins, hearing no more noise in that quarter, had ceased to apprehend an immediate invasion, and kept no watch  One night, after dodging about and listening till he was nearly falling asleep with weariness, he began to roll up his ball, for he had resolved to go home to bed  It was not long, however, before he began to feel bewildered  One after another he passed goblin houses, caves, that is, occupied by goblin families, and at length was sure they were many more than he had passed as he came  He had to use great caution to pass unseen--they lay so close together  Could his string have led him wrong? He still followed winding it, and still it led him into more thickly populated quarters, until he became quite uneasy, and indeed apprehensive; for although he was not afraid of the cobs, he was afraid of not finding his way out  But what could he do? It was of no use to sit down and wait for the morning--the morning made no difference here  It was dark, and always dark; and if his string failed him he was helpless  He might even arrive within a yard of the mine and never know it  Seeing he could do nothing better he would at least find where the end of his string was, and, if possible, how it had come to play him such a trick  He knew by the size of the ball that he was getting pretty near the last of it, when he began to feel a tugging and pulling at it  What could it mean? Turning a sharp corner, he thought he heard strange sounds', " These grew, as he went on, to a scuffling and growling and squeaking; and the noise increased, until, turning a second sharp corner, he found himself in the midst of it, and the same moment tumbled over a wallowing mass, which he knew must be a knot of the cobs' creatures", ' Before he could recover his feet, he had caught some great scratches on his face and several severe bites on his legs and arms  But as he scrambled to get up, his hand fell upon his pickaxe, and before the horrid beasts could do him any serious harm, he was laying about with it right and left in the dark  The hideous cries which followed gave him the satisfaction of knowing that he had punished some of them pretty smartly for their rudeness, and by their scampering and their retreating howls, he perceived that he had routed them  He stood for a little, weighing his battle-axe in his hand as if it had been the most precious lump of metal--but indeed no lump of gold itself could have been so precious at the time as that common tool--then untied the end of the string from it, put the ball in his pocket, and still stood thinking', " It was clear that the cobs' creatures had found his axe, had between them carried it off, and had so led him he knew not where", ' But for all his thinking he could not tell what he ought to do, until suddenly he became aware of a glimmer of light in the distance', " Without a moment's hesitation he set out for it, as fast as the unknown and rugged way would permit", ' Yet again turning a corner, led by the dim light, he spied something quite new in his experience of the underground regions--a small irregular shape of something shining  Going up to it, he found it was a piece of mica, or Muscovy glass, called sheep-silver in Scotland, and the light flickered as if from a fire behind it  After trying in vain for some time to discover an entrance to the place where it was burning, he came at length to a small chamber in which an opening, high in the wall, revealed a glow beyond  To this opening he managed to scramble up, and then he saw a strange sight  Below sat a little group of goblins around a fire, the smoke of which vanished in the darkness far aloft  The sides of the cave were full of shining minerals like those of the palace hall; and the company was evidently of a superior order, for every one wore stones about head, or arms, or waist, shining dull gorgeous colours in the light of the fire  Nor had Curdie looked long before he recognized the king himself, and found that he had made his way into the inner apartment of the royal family  Just as the consolation of this resolve dawned upon his mind and he was turning away for the cellar to follow the goblins into their hole, something touched his hand  It was the slightest touch, and when he looked he could see nothing  Feeling and peering about in the grey of the dawn, his fingers came upon a tight thread  He looked again, and narrowly, but still could see nothing', " It flashed upon him that this must be the princess's thread", " Without saying a word, for he knew no one would believe him any more than he had believed the princess, he followed the thread with his finger, contrived to give Lootie the slip, and was soon out of the house and on the mountainside--surprised that, if the thread were indeed the grandmother's messenger, it should have led the princess, as he supposed it must, into the mountain, where she would be certain to meet the goblins rushing back enraged from their defeat", ' But he hurried on in the hope of overtaking her first  When he arrived, however, at the place where the path turned off for the mine, he found that the thread did not turn with it, but went straight up the mountain', " Could it be that the thread was leading him home to his mother's cottage? Could the princess be there? He bounded up the mountain like one of its own goats, and before the sun was up the thread had brought him indeed to his mother's door", ' There it vanished from his fingers, and he could not find it, search as he might  The door was on the latch, and he entered  There sat his mother by the fire, and in her arms lay the princess, fast asleep', " 'Hush, Curdie!' said his mother", " 'Do not wake her", " I'm so glad you're come! I thought the cobs must have got you again!' With a heart full of delight, Curdie sat down at a corner of the hearth, on a stool opposite his mother's chair, and gazed at the princess, who slept as peacefully as if she had been in her own bed", ' All at once she opened her eyes and fixed them on him', " 'Oh, Curdie! you're come!' she said quietly", " 'I thought you would!' Curdie rose and stood before her with downcast eyes", " 'Irene,' he said, 'I am very sorry I did not believe you", "' 'Oh, never mind, Curdie!' answered the princess", " 'You couldn't, you know", " You do believe me now, don't you?' 'I can't help it now", ' I ought to have helped it before', "' 'Why can't you help it now?' 'Because, just as I was going into the mountain to look for you, I got hold of your thread, and it brought me here", "' 'Then you've come from my house, have you?' 'Yes, I have", "' 'I didn't know you were there", "' 'I've been there two or three days, I believe", "' 'And I never knew it! Then perhaps you can tell me why my grandmother has brought me here? I can't think", " Something woke me--I didn't know what, but I was frightened, and I felt for the thread, and there it was! I was more frightened still when it brought me out on the mountain, for I thought it was going to take me into it again, and I like the outside of it best", ' I supposed you were in trouble again, and I had to get you out  Curdie went up the mountain neither whistling nor singing, for he was vexed with Irene for taking him in, as he called it; and he was vexed with himself for having spoken to her so angrily  His mother gave a cry of joy when she saw him, and at once set about getting him something to eat, asking him questions all the time, which he did not answer so cheerfully as usual  When his meal was ready, she left him to eat it, and hurried to the mine to let his father know he was safe  When she came back, she found him fast asleep upon her bed; nor did he wake until his father came home in the evening', " 'Now, Curdie,' his mother said, as they sat at supper, 'tell us the whole story from beginning to end, just as it all happened", "' Curdie obeyed, and told everything to the point where they came out upon the lawn in the garden of the king's house", " 'And what happened after that?' asked his mother", " 'You haven't told us all", ' You ought to be very happy at having got away from those demons, and instead of that I never saw you so gloomy  There must be something more  Besides, you do not speak of that lovely child as I should like to hear you', " She saved your life at the risk of her own, and yet somehow you don't seem to think much of it", "' 'She talked such nonsense' answered Curdie, 'and told me a pack of things that weren't a bit true; and I can't get over it", "' 'What were they?' asked his father", " 'Your mother may be able to throw some light upon them", "' Then Curdie made a clean breast of it, and told them everything", ' They all sat silent for some time, pondering the strange tale', " At last Curdie's mother spoke", " 'You confess, my boy,' she said, 'there is something about the whole affair you do not understand?' 'Yes, of course, mother,' he answered", " 'I cannot understand how a child knowing nothing about the mountain, or even that I was shut up in it, should come all that way alone, straight to where I was; and then, after getting me out of the hole, lead me out of the mountain too, where I should not have known a step of the way if it had been as light as in the open air", "' 'Then you have no right to say what she told you was not true", ' She did take you out, and she must have had something to guide her: why not a thread as well as a rope, or anything else? There is something you cannot explain, and her explanation may be the right one', "' 'It's no explanation at all, mother; and I can't believe it", "' 'That may be only because you do not understand it", ' If you did, you would probably find it was an explanation, and believe it thoroughly', " I don't blame you for not being able to believe it, but I do blame you for fancying such a child would try to deceive you", ' Why should she? Depend upon it, she told you all she knew  Until you had found a better way of accounting for it all, you might at least have been more sparing of your judgement', "' 'That is what something inside me has been saying all the time,' said Curdie, hanging down his head", " 'But what do you make of the grandmother? That is what I can't get over" ,  ' Everything was for some time quiet above ground  The king was still away in a distant part of his dominions  The men-at-arms kept watching about the house  They had been considerably astonished by finding at the foot of the rock in the garden the hideous body of the goblin creature killed by Curdie; but they came to the conclusion that it had been slain in the mines, and had crept out there to die; and except an occasional glimpse of a live one they saw nothing to cause alarm  Curdie kept watching in the mountain, and the goblins kept burrowing deeper into the earth  As long as they went deeper there was, Curdie judged, no immediate danger  To Irene the summer was as full of pleasure as ever, and for a long time, although she often thought of her grandmother during the day, and often dreamed about her at night, she did not see her', " The kids and the flowers were as much her delight as ever, and she made as much friendship with the miners' children she met on the mountain as Lootie would permit; but Lootie had very foolish notions concerning the dignity of a princess, not understanding that the truest princess is just the one who loves all her brothers and sisters best, and who is most able to do them good by being humble towards them", ' At the same time she was considerably altered for the better in her behaviour to the princess  She could not help seeing that she was no longer a mere child, but wiser than her age would account for  She kept foolishly whispering to the servants, however--sometimes that the princess was not right in her mind, sometimes that she was too good to live, and other nonsense of the same sort  All this time Curdie had to be sorry, without a chance of confessing, that he had behaved so unkindly to the princess  This perhaps made him the more diligent in his endeavours to serve her  His mother and he often talked on the subject, and she comforted him, and told him she was sure he would some day have the opportunity he so much desired  Here I should like to remark, for the sake of princes and princesses in general, that it is a low and contemptible thing to refuse to confess a fault, or even an error', " If a true princess has done wrong, she is always uneasy until she has had an opportunity of throwing the wrongness away from her by saying: 'I did it; and I wish I had not; and I am sorry for having done it", "' So you see there is some ground for supposing that Curdie was not a miner only, but a prince as well", " Many such instances have been known in the world's history", ' At length, however, he began to see signs of a change in the proceedings of the goblin excavators: they were going no deeper, but had commenced running on a level; and he watched them, therefore, more closely than ever  All at once, one night, coming to a slope of very hard rock, they began to ascend along the inclined plane of its surface  Having reached its top, they went again on a level for a night or two, after which they began to ascend once more, and kept on at a pretty steep angle', " At length Curdie judged it time to transfer his observation to another quarter, and the next night he did not go to the mine at all; but, leaving his pickaxe and clue at home, and taking only his usual lumps of bread and pease pudding, went down the mountain to the king's house", ' He climbed over the wall, and remained in the garden the whole night, creeping on hands and knees from one spot to the other, and lying at full length with his ear to the ground, listening  But he heard nothing except the tread of the men-at-arms as they marched about, whose observation, as the night was cloudy and there was no moon, he had little difficulty in avoiding  For several following nights he continued to haunt the garden and listen, but with no success  At length, early one evening, whether it was that he had got careless of his own safety, or that the growing moon had become strong enough to expose him, his watching came to a sudden end  He was creeping from behind the rock where the stream ran out, for he had been listening all round it in the hope it might convey to his ear some indication of the whereabouts of the goblin miners, when just as he came into the moonlight on the lawn, a whizz in his ear and a blow upon his leg startled him  He instantly squatted in the hope of eluding further notice  But when he heard the sound of running feet, he jumped up to take the chance of escape by flight  He fell, however, with a keen shoot of pain, for the bolt of a crossbow had wounded his leg, and the blood was now streaming from it' ,  " People may have heard of the renowned adventures of Daniel O'Rourke, but how few are there who know that the cause of all his perils, above and below, was neither more nor less than his having slept under the walls of the Pooka's Tower", ' I knew the man well  He lived at the bottom of Hungry Hill, just at the right-hand side of the road as you go towards Bantry  An old man was he at the time he told me the story, with grey hair and a red nose; and it was on the 25th of June, 1813, that I heard it from his own lips, as he sat smoking his pipe under the old poplar tree, on as fine an evening as ever shone from the sky  I was going to visit the caves in Dursey Island, having spent the morning at Glengariff  "I am often axed to tell it, sir," said he, "so that this is not the first time', " The master's son, you see, had come from beyond foreign parts in France and Spain, as young gentlemen used to go before Buonaparte or any such was heard of; and, sure enough, there was a dinner given to all the people on the ground, gentle and simple, high and low, rich and poor", " The _ould_ gentlemen were the gentlemen, after all, saving your honour's presence", " They'd swear at a body a little, to be sure, and, maybe, give one a cut of a whip now and then, but we were no losers by it in the end; and they were so easy and civil, and kept such rattling houses, and thousands of welcomes; and there was no grinding for rent, and there was hardly a tenant on the estate that did not taste of his landlord's bounty often and often in a year; but now it's another thing", " No matter for that, sir, for I'd better be telling you my story", ' "Well, we had everything of the best, and plenty of it; and we ate, and we drank, and we danced, and the young master, by the same token, danced with Peggy Barry, from the Bohereen--a lovely young couple they were, though they are both low enough now', " To make a long story short, I got, as a body may say, the same thing as tipsy almost, for I can't remember, ever at all, no ways, how it was I left the place; only I did leave it, that's certain", " Well, I thought, for all that, in myself, I'd just step to Molly Cronohan's, the fairy woman, to speak a word about the bracket heifer that was bewitched; and so, as I was crossing the stepping-stones of the ford of Ballyashenogh, and was looking up at the stars, and blessing myself--for why? it was Lady-day--I missed my foot, and souse I fell into the water", " 'Death alive!' thought I, 'I'll be drowned now!' However, I began swimming, swimming, swimming away for dear life, till at last I got ashore, somehow or other, but never the one of me can tell how, upon a _dissolute_ island", ' "I wandered and wandered about there, without knowing where I wandered, until at last I got into a big bog', " The moon was shining as bright as day, or your fair lady's eyes, sir (with your pardon for mentioning her), and I looked east and west, north and south, and every way, and nothing did I see but bog, bog, bog", " I could never find out how I got into it; and my heart grew cold with fear, for sure and certain I was that it would be my _berrin'_ place", ' So I sat upon a stone, which, as good luck would have it, was close by me, and I began to scratch my head, and sing the ULLAGONE--when all of a sudden the moon grew black, and I looked up and saw something for all the world as if it was moving down between me and it, and I could not tell what it was', " Down it came with a pounce, and looked at me full in the face; and what was it but an eagle?--as fine a one as ever flew from the kingdom of Kerry! So he looked at me in the face, and says he to me, 'Daniel O'Rourke,' says he, 'how do you do?' 'Very well, I thank you, sir,' says I; 'I hope you're well'; wondering out of my senses all the time how an eagle came to speak like a Christian", " 'What brings you here, Dan?' says he", " 'Nothing at all, sir,' says I, 'only I wish I was safe home again", "' 'Is it out of the island you want to go, Dan?' says he", " ''Tis, sir,' says I; so I up and told him how I had taken a drop too much, and fell into the water; how I swam to the island; and how I got into the bog and did not know my way out of it", " 'Dan,' says he, after a minute's thought, 'though it is very improper of you to get drunk on a Lady-day, yet, as you are a decent sober man, who 'tends mass well, and never fling stones at me or mine, nor cries out after one in the field, my life for yours,' says he; 'so get up on my back, and grip me well for fear you'd fall off, and I'll fly you out of the bog", "' 'I am afraid,' says I, 'your honour's making game of me; for whoever heard of riding a-horseback on an eagle before?' ''Pon the honour of a gentleman,' says he, putting his right foot on his breast, 'I am quite in earnest; and so now either take my offer or starve in the bog--besides I see that your weight is sinking the stone", '\' "It was true enough, as he said, for I found the stone every minute going from under me  I had no choice; so, thinks I to myself, faint heart never won fair lady, and this is fair persuadance', " 'I thank your honour,' says I, 'for the loan of your civility; and I'll take your kind offer", "' I therefore mounted on the back of the eagle, and held him tight enough by the throat, and up he flew in the air like a lark", ' Little I knew the trick he was going to serve me  THERE was once upon a time a couple of rich folks who had twelve sons, and when the youngest was grown up he would not stay at home any longer, but would go out into the world and seek his fortune  His father and mother said that they thought he was very well off at home, and that he was welcome to stay with them; but he could not rest, and said that he must and would go, so at last they had to give him leave', " When he had walked a long way, he came to a King's palace", ' There he asked for a place and got it  Now the daughter of the King of that country had been carried off into the mountains by a Troll, and the King had no other children, and for this cause both he and all his people were full of sorrow and affliction, and the King had promised the Princess and half his kingdom to anyone who could set her free; but there was no one who could do it, though a great number had tried  So when the youth had been there for the space of a year or so, he wanted to go home again to pay his parents a visit; but when he got there his father and mother were dead, and his brothers had divided everything that their parents possessed between themselves, so that there was nothing at all left for him', " 'Shall I, then, receive nothing at all of my inheritance?' asked the youth", " 'Who could know that you were still alive--you who have been a wanderer so long?' answered the brothers", " 'However, there are twelve mares upon the hills which we have not yet divided among us, and if you would like to have them for your share, you may take them", "' So the youth, well pleased with this, thanked them, and at once set off to the hill where the twelve mares were at pasture", ' When he got up there and found them, each mare had her foal, and by the side of one of them was a big dapple-grey foal as well, which was so sleek that it shone again', " 'Well, my little foal, you are a fine fellow!' said the youth", " 'Yes, but if you will kill all the other little foals so that I can suck all the mares for a year, you shall see how big and handsome I shall be then!' said the Foal", ' So the youth did this--he killed all the twelve foals, and then went back again  Next year, when he came home again to look after his mares and the foal, it was as fat as it could be, and its coat shone with brightness, and it was so big that the lad had the greatest difficulty in getting on its back, and each of the mares had another foal', " 'Well, it's very evident that I have lost nothing by letting you suck all my mares,' said the lad to the yearling; 'but now you are quite big enough, and must come away with me", "' 'No,' said the Colt, 'I must stay here another year; kill the twelve little foals, and then I can suck all the mares this year also, and you shall see how big and handsome I shall be by summer", "' So the youth did it again, and when he went up on the hill next year to look after his colt and the mares, each of the mares had her foal again; but the dappled colt was so big that when the lad wanted to feel its neck to see how fat it was, he could not reach up to it, it was so high? and it was so bright that the light glanced off its coat", " 'Big and handsome you were last year, my colt, but this year you are ever so much handsomer,' said the youth; 'in all the King's court no such horse is to be found", ' But now you shall come away with me', "' 'No,' said the dappled Colt once more; 'here I must stay for another year", ' Just kill the twelve little foals again, so that I can suck the mares this year also, and then come and look at me in the summer', "' So the youth did it--he killed all the little foals, and then went home again", ' But next year, when he returned to look after the dappled colt and the mares, he was quite appalled  He had never imagined that any horse could become so big and overgrown, for the dappled horse had to lie down on all fours before the youth could get on his back, and it was very hard to do that even when it was lying down, and it was so plump that its coat shone and glistened just as if it had been a looking-glass  This time the dappled horse was not unwilling to go away with the youth, so he mounted it, and when he came riding home to his brothers they all smote their hands together and crossed themselves, for never in their lives had they either seen or heard tell of such a horse as that', " 'If you will procure me the best shoes for my horse, and the most magnificent saddle and bridle that can be found,' said the youth, 'you may have all my twelve mares just as they are standing out on the hill, and their twelve foals into the bargain", "' For this year also each mare had her foal", ' The brothers were quite willing to do this; so the lad got such shoes for his horse that the sticks and stones flew high up into the air as he rode away over the hills, and such a gold saddle and such a gold bridle that they could be seen glittering and glancing from afar', " 'And now we will go to the King's palace,' said Dapplegrim--that was the horse's name, 'but bear in mind that you must ask the King for a good stable and excellent fodder for me" ,  'In ancient times a giant was once traveling on a great highway, when suddenly an unknown man sprang up before him, and said, halt, not one step farther  What  Cried the giant, a creature whom I can crush between my fingers, wants to block my way  Who are you that you dare to speak so boldly  I am death, answered the other  No one resists me, and you also must obey my commands  But the giant refused, and began to struggle with death  It was a long, violent battle, in which at last the giant got the upper hand, and struck death down with his fist, so that he collapsed by a stone  The giant went his way, and death lay there conquered, and so weak that he could not get up again  What will be done now, said he, if I stay lying here in a corner', " No one will die in the world, and it will get so full of people that they won't have room to stand beside each other", ' In the meantime a young man came along the road, who was strong and healthy, singing a song, and glancing around on every side  When he saw the half-fainting one, he went compassionately to him, raised him up, poured a strengthening draught out of his flask for him, and waited till he regained some strength  Do you know, said the stranger, whilst he was getting up, who I am, and who it is whom you have helped on his legs again  No, answered the youth, I do not know you  I am death, said he, I spare no one, and can make no exception with you - but that you may see that I am grateful, I promise you that I will not fall on you unexpectedly, but will send my messengers to you before I come and take you away  Well, said the youth, it is something gained that I shall know when you come, and at any rate be safe from you for so long  Then he went on his way, and was light-hearted, and enjoyed himself, and lived without thought  But youth and health did not last long  Soon came sicknesses and sorrows, which tormented him by day, and took away his rest by night  Die, I shall not, said he to himself, for death will send his messengers before that, but I do wish these wretched days of sickness were over  As soon as he felt himself well again he began once more to live merrily  Then one day someone tapped him on the shoulder  He looked round, and death stood behind him, and said, follow me, the hour of your departure from this world has come  What, replied the man, will you break your word  Did you not promise me that you would send your messengers to me before coming yourself  I have seen none  Silence, answered death  Have I not sent one messenger to you after another  Did not fever come and smite you, and shake you, and cast you down There was once upon a time a poor peasant called crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two talers  When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and he would willingly have been a doctor too  So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor  Oh, yes, said the doctor, that is soon managed  What must I do, asked the peasant  In the first place buy yourself an abc book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece  In the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine  Thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words, I am doctor knowall, and have that nailed up above your house-door  The peasant did everything that he had been told to do  When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen  Then he was told about doctor knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money  So the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked crabb if he were doctor knowall  Yes, he was, he said  Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money  Oh, yes, but grete, my wife, must go too  The lord was willing and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together', " When they came to the nobleman's castle, the table was spread, and crabb was told to sit down and eat", ' Yes, but my wife, grete, too, said he, and he seated himself with her at the table  And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, grete, that was the first  Meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish  The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say, that is the first thief, and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside, the doctor knows all, we shall fare ill, he said I was the first  The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced  So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, grete, that is the second  This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could  The third fared no better, for the peasant again said, grete, that is the third  The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover  Actually, there were crabs  The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried, ah, poor crabb  When the lord heard that, he cried, there  He knows it, he must also know who had the money Whither do you go  To walpe', " I to walpe, you to walpe, so, so, together we'll

great deal of money  Indeed, he spent so much that very soon there was none left, and Don Giovanni, instead of being a rich man with everything he could wish for, was forced to put on the dress of a pilgrim, and to wander from place to place begging his bread  One day he was walking down a broad road when he was stopped by a handsome man he had never seen before, who, little as Don Giovanni knew it, was the devil himself', " 'Would you like to be rich,' asked the devil, 'and to lead a pleasant life?' 'Yes, of course I should,' replied the Don", ' \'Well, here is a purse; take it and say to it, "Dear purse, give me some money," and you will get as much as you can want But the charm will only work if you promise to remain three years, three months, and three days without washing and without combing and without shaving your beard or changing your clothes  If you do all this faithfully, when the time is up you shall keep the purse for yourself, and I will let you off any other conditions', "' Now Don Giovanni was a man who never troubled his head about the future", ' He did not once think how very uncomfortable he should be all those three years, but only that he should be able, by means of the purse, to have all sorts of things he had been obliged to do without; so he joyfully put the purse in his pocket and went on his way  He soon began to ask for money for the mere pleasure of it, and there was always as much as he needed', " For a little while he even forgot to notice how dirty he was getting, but this did not last long, for his hair became matted with dirt and hung over his eyes, and his pilgrim's dress was a mass of horrible rags and tatters", ' He was in this state when, one morning, he happened to be passing a fine palace; and, as the sun was shining bright and warm, he sat down on the steps and tried to shake off some of the dust which he had picked up on the road', " But in a few minutes a maid saw him, and said to her master, 'I pray you, sir, to drive away that beggar who is sitting on the steps, or he will fill the whole house with his dirt", "' So the master went out and called from some distance off, for he was really afraid to go near the man, 'You filthy beggar, leave my house at once!' 'You need not be so rude,' said Don Giovanni; 'I am not a beggar, and if I chose I could force you and your wife to leave your house", "' 'What is that you can do?' laughed the gentleman", " 'Will you sell me your house?' asked Don Giovanni", " 'I will buy it from you on the spot", "' 'Oh, the dirty creature is quite mad!' thought the gentleman", " 'I shall just accept his offer for a joke", "' And aloud he said: ' All right; follow me, and we will go to a lawyer and get him to make a contract", "' And Don Giovanni followed him, and an agreement was drawn up by which the house was to be sold at once, and a large sum of money paid down in eight days", " Then the Don went to an inn, where he hired two rooms, and, standing in one of them, said to his purse, ' Dear purse, fill this room with gold;' and when the eight days were up it was so full you could not have put in another sovereign", " When the owner of the house came to take away his money Don Giovanni led him into the room and said: 'There, just pocket what you want", "' The gentleman stared with open mouth at the astonishing sight; but he had given his word to sell the house, so he took his money, as he was told, and went away with his wife to look for some place to live in", ' And Don Giovanni left the inn and dwelt in the beautiful rooms, where his rags and dirt looked sadly out of place  And every day these got worse and worse  By-and-bye the fame of his riches reached the ears of the king, and, as he himself was always in need of money, he sent for Don Giovanni, as he wished to borrow a large sum  Don Giovanni readily agreed to lend him what he wanted, and sent next day a huge waggon laden with sacks of gold', " 'Who can he be?' thought the king to himself", " 'Why, he is much richer than I!' The king took as much as he had need of; then ordered the rest to be returned to Don Giovanni, who refused to receive it, saying, 'Tell his majesty I am much hurt at his proposal", ' I shall certainly not take back that handful of gold, and, if he declines to accept it, keep it yourself There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in wait  He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither, whistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him and said, "Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and contented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an alms " The huntsman took pity on the poor old creature, felt in his pocket, and gave her what he could afford  He was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and said, "Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you  I will make you a present in return for your good heart  Go on your way now, but in a little while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting which have a cloak in their claws, and are fighting for it, take your gun and shoot into the midst of them  They will let the cloak fall down to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down dead  Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak  When you throw it over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain place, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye  Take out the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning early, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your pillow " The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself, "Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come true " And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard in the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he looked up and saw there a swarm of birds who were tearing a piece of cloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as if each wanted to have it all to himself  "Well," said the huntsman, "this is amazing, it has really come to pass just as the old crone foretold," and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about  The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time  Then the huntsman did as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the heart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him  Next morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he wished to see if it also had been fulfilled  When he lifted up the pillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found another, and so it went on, every time he got up  He gathered together a heap of gold, but at last he thought, "Of what use is all my gold to me if I stay at home? I will go forth and see the world " He then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman\'s pouch and gun, and went out into the world  It came to pass, that one day he traveled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him stood a fine castle  An old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of the windows  The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the maiden, "There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his body  We must filch it from him, daughter of my heart, it is more suitable for us than for him', " He has a bird's heart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning under his pillow", '" She told her what she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with angry eyes, "And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the worse for you " Now when the huntsman came nearer he noticed the maiden, and said to himself, "I have traveled about for such a long time, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle  I have certainly money enough " Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of the beautiful picture  He entered the house, and was well received and courteously entertained  Before long he was so much in love with the young witch that he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as she saw them, and liked to do what she desired  Once upon a time there was a King, so great, so beloved by his people, and so respected by all his neighbours and allies that one might almost say he was the happiest monarch alive  His good fortune was made even greater by the choice he had made for wife of a Princess as beautiful as she was virtuous, with whom he lived in perfect happiness  Now, of this chaste marriage was born a daughter endowed with so many gifts that they had no regret because other children were not given to them  Magnificence, good taste, and abundance reigned in the palace; there were wise and clever ministers, virtuous and devoted courtiers, faithful and diligent servants  The spacious stables were filled with the most beautiful horses in the world, and coverts of rich caparison; but what most astonished strangers who came to admire them was to see, in the finest stall, a master donkey, with great long ears  Now, it was not for a whim but for a good reason that the King had given this donkey a particular and distinguished place  The special qualities of this rare animal deserved the distinction, since nature had made it in so extraordinary a way that its litter, instead of being like that of other donkeys, was covered every morning with an abundance of beautiful golden crowns, and golden louis of every kind, which were collected daily  Since the vicissitudes of life wait on Kings as much as on their subjects, and good is always mingled with ill, it so befell that the Queen was suddenly attacked by a fatal illness, and, in spite of science, and the skill of the doctors, no remedy could be found  There was great mourning throughout the land  The King who, notwithstanding the famous proverb, that marriage is the tomb of love, was deeply attached to his wife, was distressed beyond measure and made fervent vows to all the temples in his kingdom, and offered to give his life for that of his beloved consort; but he invoked the gods and the Fairies in vain  The Queen, feeling her last hour approach, said to her husband, who was dissolved in tears: "It is well that I should speak to you of a certain matter before I die: if, perchance, you should desire to marry again    " At these words the King broke into piteous cries, took his wife\'s hands in his own, and assured her that it was useless to speak to him of a second marriage  "No, my dear spouse," he said at last, "speak to me rather of how I may follow you " "The State," continued the Queen with a finality which but increased the laments of the King, "the State demands successors, and since I have only given you a daughter, it will urge you to beget sons who resemble you; but I ask you earnestly not to give way to the persuasions of your people until you have found a Princess more beautiful and more perfectly fashioned than I  I beg you to swear this to me, and then I shall die content " Perchance, the Queen, who did not lack self-esteem, exacted this oath firmly believing that there was not her equal in the world, and so felt assured that the King would never marry again  Be this as it may, at length she died, and never did husband make so much lamentation; the King wept and sobbed day and night, and the punctilious fulfilment of the rites of widower-hood, even the smallest, was his sole occupation  But even great griefs do not last for ever  After a time the magnates of the State assembled and came to the King, urging him to take another wife  At first this request seemed hard to him and made him shed fresh tears  He pleaded the vows he had made to the Queen, and defied his counsellors to find a Princess more beautiful and better fashioned than was she, thinking this to be impossible  But the Council treated the promise as a trifle, and said that it mattered little about beauty if the Queen were but virtuous and fruitful  For the State needed Princes for its peace and prosperity, and though, in truth, the Princess, his daughter, had all the qualities requisite for making a great Queen, yet of necessity she must choose an alien for her husband, and then the stranger would take her away with him  If, on the other hand, he remained in her country and shared the throne with her, their children would not be considered to be of pure native stock, and so, there being no Prince of his name, neighbouring peoples would stir up wars, and the kingdom would be ruined  The King, impressed by these considerations, promised that he would think over the matter  And so search was made among all the marriageable Princesses for one that would suit him  Every day charming portraits were brought him, but none gave promise of the beauty of his late Queen; instead of coming to a decision he brooded over his sorrow until in the end his reason left him  DRAKESTAIL was very little, that is why he was called Drakestail; but tiny as he was he had brains, and he knew what he was about, for having begun with nothing he ended by amassing a hundred crowns  Now the King of the country, who was very extravagant and never kept any money, having heard that Drakestail had some, went one day in his own person to borrow his hoard, and, my word, in those days Drakestail was not a little proud of having lent money to the King  But after the first and second year, seeing that they never even dreamed of paying the interest, he became uneasy, so much so that at last he resolved to go and see His Majesty himself, and get repaid', " So one fine morning Drakestail, very spruce and fresh, takes the road, singing: 'Quack, quack, quack, when shall I get my money back?' He had not gone far when he met friend Fox, on his rounds that way", " 'Good-morning, neighbour,' says the friend, 'where are you off to so early?' 'I am going to the King for what he owes me", "' 'Oh! take me with thee!' Drakestail said to himself: 'One can't have too many friends", "' ", ' ', " 'I will,' says he, 'but going on all-fours you will soon be tired", ' Make yourself quite small, get into my throat--go into my gizzard and I will carry you', "' 'Happy thought!' says friend Fox", ' He takes bag and baggage, and, presto! is gone like a letter into the post', " And Drakestail is off again, all spruce and fresh, still singing: 'Quack, quack, quack, when shall I have my money back?' He had not gone far when he met his lady-friend Ladder, leaning on her wall", " 'Good morning, my duckling,' says the lady friend, 'whither away so bold?' 'I am going to the King for what he owes me", "' 'Oh! take me with thee!' Drakestail said to himself: 'One can't have too many friends", "' ", ' ', " 'I will,' says he, 'but with your wooden legs you will soon be tired", ' Make yourself quite small, get into my throat--go into my gizzard and I will carry you', "' 'Happy thought!' says my friend Ladder, and nimble, bag and baggage, goes to keep company with friend Fox", " And 'Quack, quack, quack", "' Drakestail is off again, singing and spruce as before", ' A little farther he meets his sweetheart, my friend River, wandering quietly in the sunshine', " 'Thou, my cherub,' says she, 'whither so lonesome, with arching tail, on this muddy road?' 'I am going to the King, you know, for what he owes me", "' 'Oh! take me with thee!' Drakestail said to himself: 'We can't be too many friends", "'", '   Once upon a time there lived an old man who had only one son, whom he loved dearly; but they were very poor, and often had scarcely enough to eat', " Then the old man fell ill, and things grew worse than ever, so he called his son and said to him: 'My dear boy, I have no longer any food to give you, and you must go into the world and get it for yourself", ' It does not matter what work you do, but remember if you do it well and are faithful to your master, you will always have your reward', "' So Peter put a piece of black bread in his knapsack, and strapping it on his back, took a stout stick in his hand, and set out to seek his fortune", " For a long while he travelled on and on, and nobody seemed to want him; but one day he met an old man, and being a polite youth, he took off his hat and said: 'Good morning,' in a pleasant voice", " 'Good morning,' answered the old man; 'and where are you going?' 'I am wandering through the country trying to get work,' replied Peter", " 'Then stay with me, for I can give you plenty,' said the old man, and Peter stayed", ' His work did not seem hard, for he had only two horses and a cow to see after, and though he had been hired for a year, the year consisted of but three days, so that it was not long before he received his wages  In payment the old man gave him a nut, and offered to keep him for another year; but Peter was home-sick; and, besides, he would rather have been paid ever so small a piece of money than a nut; for, thought he, nuts grow on every tree, and I can gather as many as I like  However, he did not say this to the old man, who had been kind to him, but just bade him farewell', " The nearer Peter drew to his father's house the more ashamed he felt at having brought back such poor wages", ' What could one nut do for him? Why, it would not buy even a slice of bacon  It was no use taking it home, he might as well eat it  So he sat down on a stone and cracked it with his teeth, and then took it out of his mouth to break off the shell', " But who could ever guess what came out of that nut? Why, horses and oxen and sheep stepped out in such numbers that they seemed as if they would stretch to the world's end! The sight gave Peter such a shock that he wrung his hands in dismay", ' What was he to do with all these creatures, where was he to put them? He stood and gazed in terror, and at this moment Eisenkopf came by', " 'What is the matter, young man?' asked he", " 'Oh, my friend, there is plenty the matter,' answered Peter", " 'I have gained a nut as my wages, and when I cracked it this crowd of beasts came out, and I don't know what to do with them all!' 'Listen to me, my son,' said Eisenkopf", " 'If you will promise never to marry I will drive them all back into the nut again", "' In his trouble Peter would have promised far harder things than this, so he gladly gave the promise Eisenkopf asked for; and at a whistle from the stranger the animals all began crowding into the nut again, nearly tumbling over each other in their haste", ' When the last foot had got inside, the two halves of the shell shut close  Then Peter put it in his pocket and went on to the house  No sooner had he reached it than he cracked his nut for the second time, and out came the horses, sheep, and oxen again  Indeed Peter thought that there were even more of them than before  The old man could not believe his eyes when he saw the multitudes of horses, oxen and sheep standing before his door', " 'How did you come by all these?' he gasped, as soon as he could speak; and the son told him the whole story, and of the promise he had given Eisenkopf", ' The next day some of the cattle were driven to market and sold, and with the money the old man was able to buy some of the fields and gardens round his house, and in a few months had grown the richest and most prosperous man in the whole village', " Everything seemed to turn to gold in his hands, till one day, when he and his son were sitting in the orchard watching their herds of cattle grazing in the meadows, he suddenly said: 'Peter, my boy, it is time that you were thinking of marrying", "' 'But, my dear father, I told you I can never marry, because of the promise I gave to Eisenkopf" ,  ' There was once a man who had twelve sons: the eleven eldest were both big and strong, but the twelfth, whose name was Esben, was only a little fellow  The eleven eldest went out with their father to field and forest, but Esben preferred to stay at home with his mother, and so he was never reckoned at all by the rest, but was a sort of outcast among them  When the eleven had grown up to be men they decided to go out into the world to try their fortune, and they plagued their father to give them what they required for the journey  The father was not much in favour of this, for he was now old and weak, and could not well spare them from helping him with his work, but in the long run he had to give in  Each one of the eleven got a fine white horse and money for the journey, and so they said farewell to their father and their home, and rode away  As for Esben, no one had ever thought about him; his brothers had not even said farewell to him', " After the eleven were gone Esben went to his father and said, 'Father, give me also a horse and money; I should also like to see round about me in the world", "' 'You are a little fool,' said his father", " 'If I could have let you go, and kept your eleven brothers at home, it would have been better for me in my old age", "' 'Well, you will soon be rid of me at any rate,' said Esben", " As he could get no other horse, he went into the forest, broke off a branch, stripped the bark off it, so that it became still whiter than his brothers' horses, and, mounted on this", ' rode off after his eleven brothers  The brothers rode on the whole day, and towards evening they came to a great forest, which they entered  Far within the wood they came to a little house, and knocked at the door  There came an old, ugly, bearded hag, and opened it, and they asked her whether all of them could get quarters for the night', " 'Yes,' said the old, bearded hag, 'you shall all have quarters for the night, and, in addition, each of you shall have one of my daughters", "' The eleven brothers thought that they had come to very hospitable people", " They were well attended to, and when they went to bed, each of them got one of the hag's daughters", ' Esben had been coming along behind them, and had followed the same way, and had also found the same house in the forest  He slipped into this, without either the witch or her daughters noticing him, and hid himself under one of the beds  A little before midnight he crept quietly out and wakened his brothers', " He told these to change night-caps with the witch's daughters", " The brothers saw no reason for this, but, to get rid of Esben's persistence, they made the exchange, and slept soundly again", ' When midnight came Esben heard the old witch come creeping along  She had a broad-bladed axe in her hand, and went over all the eleven beds', " It was so dark that she could not see a hand's breadth before her, but she felt her way, and hacked the heads off all the sleepers who had the men's night-caps on--and these were her own daughters", " As soon as she had gone her way Esben wakened his brothers, and they hastily took their horses and rode off from the witch's house, glad that they had escaped so well", ' They quite forgot to thank Esben for what he had done for them', " When they had ridden onwards for some time they reached a king's palace, and inquired there whether they could be taken into service", ' Quite easily, they were told, if they would be stablemen, otherwise the king had no use for them When adam and eve were driven out of paradise, they were compelled to build a house for themselves on barren ground, and eat their bread in the sweat of their brow  Adam dug up the land, and eve spun  Every year eve brought a child into the world, but the children were unlike each other, some pretty, and some ugly  After a considerable time had gone by, God sent an angel to them, to announce that he was coming to inspect their household  Eve, delighted that the lord should be so gracious, cleaned her house diligently, decked it with flowers, and strewed rushes on the floor  Then she brought in her children, but only the beautiful ones  She washed and bathed them, combed their hair, put clean raiment on them, and cautioned them to conduct themselves decorously and modestly in the presence of the Lord  They were to bow down before him civilly, hold out their hands, and to answer his questions modestly and sensibly  The ugly children, however, were not to let themselves be seen  One hid himself beneath the hay, another under the roof, a third in the straw, the fourth in the stove, the fifth in the cellar, the sixth under a tub, the seventh beneath the wine-cask, the eighth under an old fur cloak, the ninth and tenth beneath the cloth out of which she always made their clothes, and the eleventh and twelfth under the leather out of which she cut their shoes  She had scarcely got ready, before there was a knock at the house-door  Adam looked through a chink, and saw that it was the Lord  Adam opened the door respectfully, and the heavenly father entered  There, in a row, stood the pretty children, and bowed before him, held out their hands, and knelt down  The Lord, however, began to bless them, laid his hands on the first, and said, thou shalt be a powerful king, and to the second, thou a prince, to the third, thou a count, to the fourth, thou a knight, to the fifth, thou a nobleman, to the sixth, thou a burgher, to the seventh, thou a merchant, to the eighth, thou a learned man  He bestowed upon them also all his richest blessings  When eve saw that the Lord was so mild and gracious, she thought, I will bring hither my ill-favored children also, it may be that he will bestow his blessing on them likewise  So she ran and brought them out of the hay, the straw, the stove, and wherever else she had concealed them  Then came the whole coarse, dirty, scabby, sooty band  The Lord smiled, looked at them all, and said, I will bless these also  He laid his hands on the first, and said to him, thou shalt be a peasant, to the second, thou a fisherman, to the third, thou a smith, to the fourth, thou a tanner, to the fifth, thou a weaver, to the sixth, thou a shoemaker, to the seventh, thou a tailor, to the eighth, thou a potter, to the ninth, thou a waggoner, to the tenth, thou a sailor, to the eleventh, thou a messenger, to the twelfth, thou a scullion all the days of thy life  When eve had heard all this she said, Lord, how unequally thou dividest thy gifts  After all they are all of them my children, whom I have brought into the world, thy favors should be given to all alike  But God answered, eve, thou dost not understand  It is right and necessary that the entire world should be supplied from thy children  If they were all princes and lords, who would grow corn, thresh it, grind and bake it  Who would be blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters, masons, laborers, tailors and seamstresses  Each shall have his own place, so that one shall support the other, and all shall be fed like the limbs of one body  Then eve answered, ah, Lord, forgive me, I was too quick in speaking to thee  Have thy divine will with my children  It is more than a hundred years ago! At the border of the wood, near a large lake, stood the old mansion: deep ditches surrounded it on every side, in which reeds and bulrushes grew  Close by the drawbridge, near the gate, there was an old willow tree, which bent over the reeds', " From the narrow pass came the sound of bugles and the trampling of horses' feet; therefore a little girl who was watching the geese hastened to drive them away from the bridge, before the whole hunting party came galloping up; they came, however, so quickly, that the girl, in order to avoid being run over, placed herself on one of the high corner-stones of the bridge", ' She was still half a child and very delicately built; she had bright blue eyes, and a gentle, sweet expression  But such things the baron did not notice; while he was riding past the little goose-girl, he reversed his hunting crop, and in rough play gave her such a push with it that she fell backward into the ditch  "Everything in the right place!" he cried  "Into the ditch with you " Then he burst out laughing, for that he called fun; the others joined in--the whole party shouted and cried, while the hounds barked  While the poor girl was falling she happily caught one of the branches of the willow tree, by the help of which she held herself over the water, and as soon as the baron with his company and the dogs had disappeared through the gate, the girl endeavoured to scramble up, but the branch broke off, and she would have fallen backward among the rushes, had not a strong hand from above seized her at this moment  It was the hand of a pedlar; he had witnessed what had happened from a short distance, and now hastened to assist her  "Everything in the right place," he said, imitating the noble baron, and pulling the little maid up to the dry ground  He wished to put the branch back in the place it had been broken off, but it is not possible to put everything in the right place; therefore he stuck the branch into the soft ground  "Grow and thrive if you can, and produce a good flute for them yonder at the mansion," he said; it would have given him great pleasure to see the noble baron and his companions well thrashed  Then he entered the castle--but not the banqueting hall; he was too humble for that', " No; he went to the servants' hall", " The men-servants and maids looked over his stock of articles and bargained with him; loud crying and screaming were heard from the master's table above: they called it singing--indeed, they did their best", ' Laughter and the howls of dogs were heard through the open windows: there they were feasting and revelling; wine and strong old ale were foaming in the glasses and jugs; the favourite dogs ate with their masters; now and then the squires kissed one of these animals, after having wiped its mouth first with the tablecloth  They ordered the pedlar to come up, but only to make fun of him  The wine had got into their heads, and reason had left them  They poured beer into a stocking that he could drink with them, but quick', " That's what they called fun, and it made them laugh", ' Then meadows, peasants, and farmyards were staked on one card and lost  "Everything in the right place!" the pedlar said when he had at last safely got out of Sodom and Gomorrah, as he called it  "The open high road is my right place; up there I did not feel at ease " The little maid, who was still watching the geese, nodded kindly to him as he passed through the gate  Days and weeks passed, and it was seen that the broken willow-branch which the peddlar had stuck into the ground near the ditch remained fresh and green--nay, it even put forth fresh twigs; the little goose-girl saw that the branch had taken root, and was very pleased; the tree, so she said, was now her tree  While the tree was advancing, everything else at the castle was going backward, through feasting and gambling, for these are two rollers upon which nobody stands safely  Less than six years afterwards the baron passed out of his castle-gate a poor beggar, while the baronial seat had been bought by a rich tradesman  He was the very pedlar they had made fun of and poured beer into a stocking for him to drink; but honesty and industry bring one forward, and now the pedlar was the possessor of the baronial estate  From that time forward no card-playing was permitted there "Good-day, father hollenthe " "Many thanks, pif-paf-poltrie " "May I be allowed to have your daughter?"

"Fourteen farthings in ready money, three and a half groschen owing to me, half a pound of dried apples, a handful of pretzels, and a handful of roots  \tAnd many other things are mine, \tHave I not a dowry fine?" "Pif-paf-poltrie, what is your trade? Are you a tailor?" "Something better " "A shoemaker?" "Something better " "A husbandman?" "Something better " "A joiner?" "Something better " "A smith?" "Something better " "A miller?" "Something better " "Perhaps a broom-maker?" "Yes, that\'s what I am, is it not a fine trade?"   King Hugh Curucha lived in Tir Conal, and he had three daughters, whose names were Fair, Brown, and Trembling  Fair and Brown had new dresses, and went to church every Sunday  Trembling was kept at home to do the cooking and work  They would not let her go out of the house at all; for she was more beautiful than the other two, and they were in dread she might marry before themselves  They carried on in this way for seven years  At the end of seven years the son of the king of Emania fell in love with the eldest sister  One Sunday morning, after the other two had gone to church, the old henwife came into the kitchen to Trembling, and said: "It\'s at church you ought to be this day, instead of working here at home " "How could I go?" said Trembling  "I have no clothes good enough to wear at church; and if my sisters were to see me there, they\'d kill me for going out of the house " "I\'ll give you," said the henwife, "a finer dress than either of them has ever seen  And now tell me what dress will you have?" "I\'ll have," said Trembling, "a dress as white as snow, and green shoes for my feet " Then the henwife put on the cloak of darkness, clipped a piece from the old clothes the young woman had on, and asked for the whitest robes in the world and the most beautiful that could be found, and a pair of green shoes  That moment she had the robe and the shoes, and she brought them to Trembling, who put them on  When Trembling was dressed and ready, the henwife said: "I have a honey-bird here to sit on your right shoulder, and a honey-finger to put on your left  At the door stands a milk-white mare, with a golden saddle for you to sit on, and a golden bridle to hold in your hand " Trembling sat on the golden saddle; and when she was ready to start, the henwife said: "You must not go inside the door of the church, and the minute the people rise up at the end of Mass, do you make off, and ride home as fast as the mare will carry you " When Trembling came to the door of the church there was no one inside who could get a glimpse of her but was striving to know who she was; and when they saw her hurrying away at the end of Mass, they ran out to overtake her  But no use in their running; she was away before any man could come near her  From the minute she left the church till she got home, she overtook the wind before her, and outstripped the wind behind  She came down at the door, went in, and found the henwife had dinner ready  She put off the white robes, and had on her old dress in a twinkling  When the two sisters came home the henwife asked: "Have you any news to-day from the church?" "We have great news," said they  "We saw a wonderful grand lady at the church-door  The like of the robes she had we have never seen on woman before', " It's little that was thought of our dresses beside what she had on; and there wasn't a man at the church, from the king to the beggar, but was trying to look at her and know who she was", '" The sisters would give no peace till they had two dresses like the robes of the strange lady; but honey-birds and honey-fingers were not to be found  Next Sunday the two sisters went to church again, and left the youngest at home to cook the dinner  After they had gone, the henwife came in and asked: "Will you go to church to-day?" "I would go," said Trembling, "if I could get the going " "What robe will you wear?" asked the henwife  "The finest black satin that can be found, and red shoes for my feet  Once there lived a King who had no children for many years after his marriage', " At length heaven granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate for her as 'Fairer-than-a-Fairy", "' It never occurred to the good-natured monarch that such a name was certain to call down the hatred and jealousy of the fairies in a body on the child, but this was what happened", ' No sooner had they heard of this presumptuous name than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it, and either to torment her cruelly, or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men  The eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge  This Fairy was named Lagree; she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left, and even these poor remains she had to keep all night in a strengthening liquid  She was also so spiteful that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or ill-natured tricks of the whole body of fairies  With her large experience, added to her native spite, she found but little difficulty in carrying off Fairer-than-a-Fairy  The poor child, who was only seven years old, nearly died of fear on finding herself in the power of this hideous creature', " However, when after an hour's journey underground she found herself in a splendid palace with lovely gardens, she felt a little reassured, and was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her", ' The old Fairy led her to a pretty room which she said should be hers, at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate', " She then gave two glass bottles into the Princess's charge, desiring her to take the greatest care of them, and having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience, she vanished, leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace and grounds and a good deal relieved at having only two apparently easy tasks set her", " Several years passed, during which time the Princess grew accustomed to her lonely life, obeyed the Fairy's orders, and by degrees forgot all about the court of the King her father", " One day, whilst passing near a fountain in the garden, she noticed that the sun's rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a brilliant rainbow", ' She stood still to admire it, when, to her great surprise, she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come from the centre of its rays  The voice was that of a young man, and its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered, led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming; but this had to be a mere matter of fancy, for no one was visible  The beautiful Rainbow informed Fairer-than-a-Fairy that he was young, the son of a powerful king, and that the Fairy, Lagree, who owed his parents a grudge, had revenged herself by depriving him of his natural shape for some years; that she had imprisoned him in the palace, where he had found his confinement hard to bear for some time, but now, he owned, he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love Fairer-than-a-Fairy  He added many other tender speeches to this declaration, and the Princess, to whom such remarks were a new experience, could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions  The Prince could only appear or speak under the form of a Rainbow, and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves  Fairer-than-a-Fairy lost no moment in which she could meet her lover, and they enjoyed many long and interesting interviews  One day, however, their conversation became so absorbing and time passed so quickly that the Princess forgot to attend to the fire, and it went out  Lagree, on her return, soon found out the neglect, and seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner  She ordered Fairer-than-a-Fairy to start next day at dawn to ask Locrinos for fire with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out  Now this Locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he came across, and especially enjoyed a chance of catching and eating any young girls  Our heroine obeyed with great sweetness, and without having been able to take leave of her lover she set off to go to Locrinos as to certain death  As she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by, and to use it when needed', " She took the bird's advice, and in due time arrived at the house of Locrinos", " Luckily she only found his wife at home, who was much struck by the Princess's youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners, and still further impressed by the present of the shining pebble", ' She readily let Fairer-than-a-Fairy have the fire, and in return for the stone she gave her another, which, she said, might prove useful some day  Then she sent her away without doing her any harm' ,  "There was once upon a time an old king who was ill and thought to himself 'I am lying on what must be my deathbed", "' Then said he 'tell faithful John to come to me", "' Faithful John was his favorite servant, and was so called, because he had for his whole life long been so true to him", " When therefore he came beside the bed, the king said to him 'most faithful John, I feel my end approaching, and have no anxiety except about my son", ' He is still of tender age, and cannot always know how to guide himself  If you do not promise me to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster-father, I cannot close my eyes in peace', "' Then answered faithful John 'I will not forsake him, and will serve him with fidelity, even if it should cost me my life", "' At this, the old king said 'now I die in comfort and peace", "' Then he added 'after my death, you shall show him the whole castle - all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein, but the last chamber in the long gallery, in which is the picture of the princess of the golden dwelling, shall you not show", ' If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, and will drop down in a swoon, and go through great danger for her sake, therefore you must protect him from that', "' And when faithful John had once more given his promise to the old king about this, the king said no more, but laid his head on his pillow, and died", " When the old king had been carried to his grave, faithful John told the young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said 'this will I assuredly keep, and will be faithful to you as I have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life", "' When the mourning was over, faithful John said to him 'it is now time that you should see your inheritance", " I will show you your father's palace", "' Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was one room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous picture", ' The picture, however, was so placed that when the door was opened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted that it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more charming or more beautiful in the whole world', " The young king noticed, however, that faithful John always walked past this one door, and said 'why do you never open this one for me", "' 'There is something within it, he replied, 'which would terrify you", "' But the king answered 'I have seen all the palace, and I want to know what is in this room also, and he went and tried to break open the door by force", " Then faithful John held him back and said 'I promised your father before his death that you should not see that which is in this chamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on you and on me", "' 'Ah, no, replied the young king, 'if I do not go in, it will be my certain destruction", ' I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes  I shall not leave the place now until you have unlocked the door', "' Then faithful John saw that there was no help for it now, and with a heavy heart and many sighs, sought out the key from the great bunch", ' When he opened the door, he went in first, and thought by standing before him he could hide the portrait so that the king should not see it in front of him  But what good was this  The king stood on tip-toe and saw it over his shoulder  And when he saw the portrait of the maiden, which was so magnificent and shone with gold and precious stones, he fell fainting to the ground', " Faithful John took him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought 'the misfortune has befallen us, Lord God, what will be the end of it", "' Then he strengthened him with wine, until he came to himself again" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived an old King, who fell very sick, and thought he was lying upon his death-bed; so he said, "Let faithful John come to me " This faithful John was his affectionate servant, and was so called because he had been true to him all his lifetime  As soon as John came to the bedside, the King said, "My faithful John, I feel that my end approaches, and I have no other care than about my son, who is still so young that he cannot always guide himself aright  If you do not promise to instruct him in everything he ought to know, and to be his guardian, I cannot close my eyes in peace " Then John answered, "I will never leave him; I will always serve him truly, even if it costs me my life " So the old King was comforted, and said, "Now I can die in peace  After my death you must show him all the chambers, halls, and vaults in the castle, and all the treasures which are in them; but the last room in the long corridor you must not show him, for in it hangs the portrait of the daughter of the King of the Golden Palace; if he sees her picture, he will conceive a great love for her, and will fall down in a swoon, and on her account undergo great perils, therefore you must keep him away " The faithful John pressed his master\'s hand again in token of assent, and soon after the King laid his head upon the pillow and expired  After the old King had been borne to his grave, the faithful John related to the young King all that his father had said upon his death-bed, and declared, "All this I will certainly fulfil; I will be as true to you as I was to him, if it costs me my life " When the time of mourning was passed, John said to the young King, "It is now time for you to see your inheritance; I will show you your paternal castle " So he led the King all over it, upstairs and downstairs, and showed him all the riches, and all the splendid chambers; only one room he did not open, containing the perilous portrait, which was so placed that one saw it directly the door was opened, and, moreover, it was so beautifully painted that one thought it breathed and moved; nothing in all the world could be more lifelike or more beautiful  The young King remarked, however, that the faithful John always passed by one door, so he asked, "Why do you not open that one?" "There is something in it," he replied, "which will frighten you " But the King said, "I have seen all the rest of the castle, and I will know what is in there," and he went and tried to open the door by force  The faithful John pulled him back, and said, "I promised your father before he died that you should not see the contents of that room; it would bring great misfortunes both upon you and me " "Oh, no," replied the young King, "if I do not go in it will be my certain ruin; I should have no peace night nor day until I had seen it with my own eyes  Now I will not stir from the place till you unlock the door " Then the faithful John saw that it was of no use talking; so, with a heavy heart and many sighs, he picked the key out of the great bunch  When he had opened the door, he went in first, and thought he would cover up the picture, that the King should not see it; but it was of no use, for the King stepped upon tiptoes and looked over his shoulder; and as soon as he saw the portrait of the maiden, which was so beautiful and glittered with precious stones, he fell down on the ground insensible  The faithful John lifted him up and carried him to his bed, and thought with great concern, "Mercy on us! the misfortune has happened; what will come of it?" and he gave the young King wine until he came to himself  The first words he spoke were, "Who does that beautiful picture represent?" "That is the daughter of the King of the Golden Palace," was the reply  "Then," said the King, "my love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues, they should not gainsay it; my life is set upon the search for her  You are my faithful John, you must accompany me " The trusty servant deliberated for a long while how to set about this business, for it was very difficult to get into the presence of the King\'s daughter  At last he bethought himself of a way, and said to the King, "Everything which she has around her is of gold--chairs, tables, dishes, bowls, and all the household utensils  Among your treasures are five tons of gold; let one of the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture vessels and utensils of all kinds therefrom--all kinds of birds, and wild and wonderful beasts, such as will please her, then we will travel with these, and try our luck " Then the King summoned all his goldsmiths, who worked day and night until many very beautiful things were ready', " When all had been placed on board a ship, the faithful John put on merchant's clothes, and the King likewise, so that they might travel quite unknown", ' Then they sailed over the wide sea, and sailed away until they came to the city where dwelt the daughter of the King of the Golden Palace  The faithful John told the King to remain in the ship, and wait for him  "Perhaps," said he, "I shall bring the King\'s daughter with me; therefore take care that all is in order, and set out the golden vessels and adorn the whole ship  THERE was once upon a time a man and a woman who had an only son, and he was called Jack  The woman thought that it was his duty to go out to service, and told her husband that he was to take him somewhere', " 'You must get him such a good place that he will become master of all masters,' she said, and then she put some food and a roll of tobacco into a bag for them", ' Well, they went to a great many masters, but all said that they could make the lad as good as they were themselves, but better than that they could not make him', " When the man came home to the old woman with this answer, she said, 'I shall be equally well pleased whatever you do with him; but this I do say, that you are to have him made a master over all masters", "' Then she once more put some food and a roll of tobacco into the bag, and the man and his son had to set out again", ' When they had walked some distance they got upon the ice, and there they met a man in a carriage who was driving a black horse', " 'Where are you going?' he said", " 'I have to go and get my son apprenticed to someone who will be able to teach him a trade, for my old woman comes of such well-to-do folk that she insists on his being taught to be master of all masters,' said the man", " 'We are not ill met, then,' said the man who was driving, 'for I am the kind of man who can do that, and I am just looking out for such an apprentice", " Get up behind with you,' he said to the boy, and off the horse went with them straight up into the air", " 'No, no, wait a little!' screamed the father of the boy", " 'I ought to know what your name is and where you live", "' 'Oh, I am at home both in the north and the south and the east and the west, and I am called Farmer Weatherbeard,' said the master", " 'You may come here again in a year's time, and then I will tell you if the lad suits me", "' And then they set off again and were gone", ' When the man got home the old woman inquired what had become of the son', " 'Ah! Heaven only knows what has become of him!' said the man", " 'They went up aloft", "' And then he told her what had happened", ' But when the woman heard that, and found that the man did not at all know either when their son would be out of his apprentice-ship, or where he had gone, she packed him off again to find out, and gave him a bag of food and a roll of tobacco to take away with him  When he had walked for some time he came to a great wood, and it stretched before him all day long as he went on, and when night began to fall he saw a great light, and went towards it  After a long, long time he came to a small hut at the foot of a rock, outside which an old woman was standing drawing water up from a well with her nose, it was so long', " 'Good-evening, mother,' said the man", " 'Good-evening to you too,' said the old woman", " 'No one has called me mother this hundred years", "' 'Can I lodge here to-night?' said the man", " 'No,' said the old woman", ' But the man took out his roll of tobacco, lighted a little of it, and then gave her a whiff  Then she was so delighted that she began to dance, and thus the man got leave to stay the night there  Once upon a time there lived a man who had nearly as many children as there were sparrows in the garden', " He had to work very hard all day to get them enough to eat, and was often tired and cross, and abused everything and everybody, so that people called him 'Father Grumbler", "' By-and-by he grew weary of always working, and on Sundays he lay a long while in bed, instead of going to church", ' Then after a time he found it dull to sit so many hours by himself, thinking of nothing but how to pay the rent that was owing, and as the tavern across the road looked bright and cheerful, he walked in one day and sat down with his friends', " 'It was just to chase away Care,' he said; but when he came out, hours and hours after, Care came out with him", ' Father Grumbler entered his house feeling more dismal than when he left it, for he knew that he had wasted both his time and his money', " 'I will go and see the Holy Man in the cave near the well,' he said to himself, 'and perhaps he can tell me why all the luck is for other people, and only misfortunes happen to me", "' And he set out at once for the cave", ' It was a long way off, and the road led over mountains and through valleys; but at last he reached the cave where the Holy Man dwelt, and knocked at the door', " 'Who is there?' asked a voice from within", " 'It is I, Holy Man, Father Grumbler, you know, who has as many children as sparrows in the garden", "' 'Well, and what is it that you want?' 'I want to know why other people have all the luck, and only misfortunes happen to me!' The Holy Man did not answer, but went into an inner cave, from which he came out bearing something in his hand", " 'Do you see this basket?' said he", ' \'It is a magical basket, and if you are hungry you have only got to say: "Little basket, little basket, do your duty," and you will eat the best dinner you ever had in your life  But when you have had enough, be sure you don\'t forget to cry out: "That will do for to-day " Oh!--and one thing more--you need not show it to everybody and declare that I have give it to you', " Do you understand?' Father Grumbler was always accustomed to think of himself as so unlucky that he did not know whether the Holy Man was not playing a trick upon him; but he took the basket without being polite enough to say either 'Thank you,' or 'Good-morning,' and went away", " However, he only waited till he was out of sight of the cave before he stooped down and whispered: 'Little basket, little basket, do your duty", "' Now the basket had a lid, so that he could not see what was inside, but he heard quite clearly strange noises, as if a sort of scuffling was going on", ' Then the lid burst open, and a quantity of delicious little white rolls came tumbling out one after the other, followed by a stream of small fishes all ready cooked  What a quantity there were to be sure! The whole road was covered with them, and the banks on each side were beginning to disappear', " Father Grumbler felt quite frightened at the torrent, but at last he remembered what the Holy Man had told him, and cried at the top of his voice: 'Enough! enough! That will do for to-day!' And the lid of the basket closed with a snap", ' Father Grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him, and sitting down on a heap of stones, he ate till he could eat no more  Trout, salmon, turbot, soles, and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know, lay boiled, fried, and grilled within reach of his hands', " As the Holy Man had said, he had never eaten such a dinner; still, when he had done, he shook his head, and grumbled; 'Yes, there is plenty to eat, of course, but it only makes me thirsty, and there is not a drop to drink anywhere", "' Yet, somehow, he could never tell why, he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him, which he thought was miles, and miles, and miles away", " 'Bring the best wine you have got, and two glasses, good mother,' he said as he entered, 'and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house", ' Only there is no need to chatter about it all over the place', " You understand? Eh?' And without waiting for an answer he whispered to the basket: 'Little basket, little basket, do your duty", "' The innkeeper and his wife thought that their customer had gone suddenly mad, and watched him closely, ready to spring on him if he became violent; but both instinctively jumped backwards, nearly into the fire, as rolls and fishes of every kind came tumbling out of the basket, covering the tables and chairs and the floor, and even overflowing into the street" ,  'Once upon a time lived a man and a woman who so long as they were rich had no children, but when they were poor they got a little boy  They could find no godfather for him, so the man said he would just go to another village to see if he could get one there  On his way he met a poor man, who asked him where he was going  He said he was going to see if he could get a godfather, because he was so poor that no one would stand as godfather for him  "Oh," said the poor man, "you are poor, and I am poor  I will be godfather for you, but I am so badly off I can give the child nothing  Go home and tell the midwife that she is to come to the church with the child " When they all got to the church together, the beggar was already there, and he gave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful  When he was going out of the church, the beggar said, "Now go home, I can give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing " But he gave a key to the midwife, and told her when she got home she was to give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child was fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where there was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was therein should belong to him  Now when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he once went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that he had got more from his godfather than the other, but the child could say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his father, "Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?" "Oh, yes," said the father, "you have a key  If there is a castle standing on the heath, just go to it and open it " Then the boy went thither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of  After seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went thither, and there stood the castle  When he had opened it, there was nothing within but a horse, - a white one  Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father  "Now I have a white horse, and I will travel," said he  So he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road  At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, "You should leave it lying there, you will easily find a pen where you are going, if you have need of one " As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, "Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with you " He looked around, but saw no one, so he went back again and picked it up  When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, "Wait, my dear fish, I will help you to get into the water," and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake  Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, "As you have helped me out of the mud I will give you a flute  When you are in any need, play on it, and then I will help you, and if ever you let anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to you " Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going  "Oh, to the next place " "What is your name?" "Ferdinand the Faithful " "So, then we have almost the same name, I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful " And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place  Now it was unfortunate that Ferdinand the Unfaithful knew everything that the other had ever thought and everything he was about to do  Not even all that I had gone through could make me contented with a quiet life  I soon wearied of its pleasures, and longed for change and adventure  Therefore I set out once more, but this time in a ship of my own, which I built and fitted out at the nearest seaport  I wished to be able to call at whatever port I chose, taking my own time; but as I did not intend carrying enough goods for a full cargo, I invited several merchants of different nations to join me  We set sail with the first favourable wind, and after a long voyage upon the open seas we landed upon an unknown island which proved to be uninhabited', " We determined, however, to explore it, but had not gone far when we found a roc's egg, as large as the one I had seen before and evidently very nearly hatched, for the beak of the young bird had already pierced the shell", ' In spite of all I could say to deter them, the merchants who were with me fell upon it with their hatchets, breaking the shell, and killing the young roc  Then lighting a fire upon the ground they hacked morsels from the bird, and proceeded to roast them while I stood by aghast  Scarcely had they finished their ill-omened repast, when the air above us was darkened by two mighty shadows  The captain of my ship, knowing by experience what this meant, cried out to us that the parent birds were coming, and urged us to get on board with all speed  This we did, and the sails were hoisted, but before we had made any way the rocs reached their despoiled nest and hovered about it, uttering frightful cries when they discovered the mangled remains of their young one  For a moment we lost sight of them, and were flattering ourselves that we had escaped, when they reappeared and soared into the air directly over our vessel, and we saw that each held in its claws an immense rock ready to crush us  There was a moment of breathless suspense, then one bird loosed its hold and the huge block of stone hurtled through the air, but thanks to the presence of mind of the helmsman, who turned our ship violently in another direction, it fell into the sea close beside us, cleaving it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom  We had hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rock fell with a mighty crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel, smashing it into a thousand fragments, and crushing, or hurling into the sea, passengers and crew  I myself went down with the rest, but had the good fortune to rise unhurt, and by holding on to a piece of driftwood with one hand and swimming with the other I kept myself afloat and was presently washed up by the tide on to an island  Its shores were steep and rocky, but I scrambled up safely and threw myself down to rest upon the green turf  When I had somewhat recovered I began to examine the spot in which I found myself, and truly it seemed to me that I had reached a garden of delights  There were trees everywhere, and they were laden with flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream wandered in and out under their shadow  When night came I slept sweetly in a cosy nook, though the remembrance that I was alone in a strange land made me sometimes start up and look around me in alarm, and then I wished heartily that I had stayed at home at ease  However, the morning sunlight restored my courage, and I once more wandered among the trees, but always with some anxiety as to what I might see next  I had penetrated some distance into the island when I saw an old man bent and feeble sitting upon the river bank, and at first I took him to be some ship-wrecked mariner like myself  Going up to him I greeted him in a friendly way, but he only nodded his head at me in reply  I then asked what he did there, and he made signs to me that he wished to get across the river to gather some fruit, and seemed to beg me to carry him on my back  Pitying his age and feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the stream I bent down that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade him get down  But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet (even now it makes me laugh to think of it!), this creature who had seemed to me so decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and hooking his legs round my neck gripped me so tightly that I was well-nigh choked, and so overcome with terror that I fell insensible to the ground  When I recovered my enemy was still in his place, though he had released his hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing me revive he prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the other, until I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under the trees while he gathered and ate the choicest fruits  This went on all day, and even at night, when I threw myself down half dead with weariness, the terrible old man held on tight to my neck, nor did he fail to greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me with his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march with rage and bitterness in my heart  It happened one day that I passed a tree under which lay several dry gourds, and catching one up I amused myself with scooping out its contents and pressing into it the juice of several bunches of grapes which hung from every bush  When it was full I left it propped in the fork of a tree, and a few days later, carrying the hateful old man that way, I snatched at my gourd as I passed it and had the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine so good and refreshing that I even forgot my detestable burden, and began to sing and caper  The old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my draught had produced and that I carried him more lightly than usual, so he stretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd first tasted its contents cautiously, then drained them to the very last drop  I had inherited considerable wealth from my parents, and being young and foolish I at first squandered it recklessly upon every kind of pleasure, but presently, finding that riches speedily take to themselves wings if managed as badly as I was managing mine, and remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed, I began to bethink me of how I could make the best of what still remained to me  I sold all my household goods by public auction, and joined a company of merchants who traded by sea, embarking with them at Balsora in a ship which we had fitted out between us  We set sail and took our course towards the East Indies by the Persian Gulf, having the coast of Persia upon our left hand and upon our right the shores of Arabia Felix  I was at first much troubled by the uneasy motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered my health, and since that hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness  From time to time we landed at various islands, where we sold or exchanged our merchandise, and one day, when the wind dropped suddenly, we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow, which only rose slightly above the surface of the water  Our sails were furled, and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves  I was among the number, but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us, we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island, while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives, since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale  Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it, others sprang into the sea, but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean, leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire  Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves  All that day I floated up and down, now beaten this way, now that, and when night fell I despaired for my life; but, weary and spent as I was, I clung to my frail support, and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island  The cliffs were high and steep, but luckily for me some tree-roots protruded in places, and by their aid I climbed up at last, and stretched myself upon the turf at the top, where I lay, more dead than alive, till the sun was high in the heavens  By that time I was very hungry, but after some searching I came upon some eatable herbs, and a spring of clear water, and much refreshed I set out to explore the island  Presently I reached a great plain where a grazing horse was tethered, and as I stood looking at it I heard voices talking apparently underground, and in a moment a man appeared who asked me how I came upon the island', " I told him my adventures, and heard in return that he was one of the grooms of Mihrage, the king of the island, and that each year they came to feed their master's horses in this plain", ' He took me to a cave where his companions were assembled, and when I had eaten of the food they set before me, they bade me think myself fortunate to have come upon them when I did, since they were going back to their master on the morrow, and without their aid I could certainly never have found my way to the inhabited part of the island  Early the next morning we accordingly set out, and when we reached the capital I was graciously received by the king, to whom I related my adventures, upon which he ordered that I should be well cared for and provided with such things as I needed  Being a merchant I sought out men of my own profession, and particularly those who came from foreign countries, as I hoped in this way to hear news from Bagdad, and find out some means of returning thither, for the capital was situated upon the sea-shore, and visited by vessels from all parts of the world  In the meantime I heard many curious things, and answered many questions concerning my own country, for I talked willingly with all who came to me  Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial  Indeed, the sailors assured me that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it  However, I saw nothing strange upon my voyage, saving some fish that were full two hundred cubits long, but were fortunately more in dread of us than even we were of them, and fled from us if we did but strike upon a board to frighten them  Other fishes there were only a cubit long which had heads like owls  One day after my return, as I went down to the quay, I saw a ship which had just cast anchor, and was discharging her cargo, while the merchants to whom it belonged were busily directing the removal of it to their warehouses  Drawing nearer I presently noticed that my own name was marked upon some of the packages, and after having carefully examined them, I felt sure that they were indeed those which I had put on board our ship at Balsora  I then recognised the captain of the vessel, but as I was certain that he believed me to be dead, I went up to him and asked who owned the packages that I was looking at  "There was on board my ship," he replied, "a merchant of Bagdad named Sindbad  One day he and several of my other passengers landed upon what we supposed to be an island, but which was really an enormous whale floating asleep upon the waves  No sooner did it feel upon its back the heat of the fire which had been kindled, than it plunged into the depths of the sea  Several of the people who were upon it perished in the waters, and among others this unlucky Sindbad  This merchandise is his, but I have resolved to dispose of it for the benefit of his family if I should ever chance to meet with them There was once a wizard who used to take the form of a poor man, and went to houses and begged, and caught pretty girls  No one knew whither he carried them, for they were never seen again  One day he appeared before the door of a man who had three pretty daughters  He looked like a poor weak beggar, and carried a basket on his back, as if he meant to collect charitable gifts in it  He begged for a little food, and when the eldest daughter came out and was just handing him a piece of bread, he did but touch her, and she was forced to jump into his basket  Thereupon he hurried off with long strides, and carried her away into a dark forest to his house, which stood in the midst of it  Everything in the house was magnificent  He gave her whatsoever she could possibly desire, and said, my darling, you will certainly be happy with me, for you have everything your heart can wish for  This lasted a few days, and then he said, I must journey forth, and leave you alone for a short time  Here are the keys of the house  You may go everywhere and look at everything except into one room, which this little key opens, and there I forbid you to go on pain of death  He likewise gave her an egg and said, preserve the egg carefully for me, and carry it continually about with you, for a great misfortune would arise from the loss of it  She took the keys and the egg, and promised to obey him in everything  When he was gone, she went all round the house from the bottom to the top, and examined everything  The rooms shone with silver and gold, and she thought she had never seen such great splendor  At length she came to the forbidden door  She wished to pass it by, but curiosity let her have no rest  She examined the key, it looked just like any other  She put it in the keyhole and turned it a little, and the door sprang open  But what did she see when she went in  A great bloody basin stood in the middle of the room, and therein lay human beings, dead and hewn to pieces, and hard by was a block of wood, and a gleaming axe lay upon it  She was so terribly alarmed that the egg which she held in her hand fell into the basin  She got it out and wiped the blood off, but in vain, it appeared again in a moment  She washed and scrubbed, but she could not get it off  It was not long before the man came back from his journey, and the first things which he asked for were the key and the egg  She gave them to him, but she trembled as she did so, and he saw at once by the red spots that she had been in the bloody chamber  Since you have gone into the room against my will, said he, you shall go back into it against your own  Your life is ended  He threw her down, dragged her along by her hair, cut her head off on the block, and hewed her in pieces so that her blood ran on the ground  Then he threw her into the basin with the rest  Several hundreds of years ago there lived in a forest a wood-cutter and his wife and children', " He was very poor, having only his axe to depend upon, and two mules to carry the wood he cut to the neighbouring town; but he worked hard, and was always out of bed by five o'clock, summer and winter", ' This went on for twenty years, and though his sons were now grown up, and went with their father to the forest, everything seemed to go against them, and they remained as poor as ever', " In the end the wood-cutter lost heart, and said to himself: 'What is the good of working like this if I never am a penny the richer at the end? I shall go to the forest no more! And perhaps, if I take to my bed, and do not run after Fortune, one day she may come to me", "' So the next morning he did not get up, and when six o'clock struck, his wife, who had been cleaning the house, went to see what was the matter", " 'Are you ill?' she asked wonderingly, surprised at not finding him dressed", " 'The cock has crowed ever so often", ' It is high time for you to get up', "' 'Why should I get up?' asked the man, without moving", " 'Why? to go to the forest, of course", "' 'Yes; and when I have toiled all day I hardly earn enough to give us one meal", "' 'But what can we do, my poor husband?' said she", " 'It is just a trick of Fortune's, who would never smile upon us", "' 'Well, I have had my fill of Fortune's tricks,' cried he", " 'If she wants me she can find me here", ' But I have done with the wood for ever', "' 'My dear husband, grief has driven you mad! Do you think Fortune will come to anybody who does not go after her? Dress yourself, and saddle the mules, and begin your work", " Do you know that there is not a morsel of bread in the house?' 'I don't care if there isn't, and I am not going to the forest", ' It is no use your talking; nothing will make me change my mind', "' The distracted wife begged and implored in vain; her husband persisted in staying in bed, and at last, in despair, she left him and went back to her work", " An hour or two later a man from the nearest village knocked at her door, and when she opened it, he said to her: 'Good-morning, mother", " I have got a job to do, and I want to know if your husband will lend me your mules, as I see he is not using them, and can lend me a hand himself?' 'He is upstairs; you had better ask him,' answered the woman", ' And the man went up, and repeated his request', " 'I am sorry, neighbour, but I have sworn not to leave my bed, and nothing will make me break my vow", "' 'Well, then, will you lend me your two mules? I will pay you something for them", "' 'Certainly, neighbour", ' Take them and welcome', "' So the man left the house, and leading the mules from the stable, placed two sacks on their back, and drove them to a field where he had found a hidden treasure", ' He filled the sacks with the money, though he knew perfectly well that it belonged to the sultan, and was driving them quietly home again, when he saw two soldiers coming along the road  Now the man was aware that if he was caught he would be condemned to death, so he fled back into the forest  Rich and happy as I was after my third voyage, I could not make up my mind to stay at home altogether  My love of trading, and the pleasure I took in anything that was new and strange, made me set my affairs in order, and begin my journey through some of the Persian provinces, having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming in the different places I intended to visit  I took ship at a distant seaport, and for some time all went well, but at last, being caught in a violent hurricane, our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her, and many of our company perished in the waves  I, with a few others, had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck, for the storm had driven us near an island, and scrambling up beyond the reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted, to wait for morning  At daylight we wandered inland, and soon saw some huts, to which we directed our steps  As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us, and we were led to their houses, and as it were divided among our captors  I with five others was taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the ground, and certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made signs to us to eat  Observing that they themselves did not touch them, I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion; but my companions, being very hungry, rashly ate up all that was set before them, and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad  Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word they said, nor did they heed when I spoke to them  The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil, of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly, but I only tasted a few grains, understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating, and this was exactly what happened  My unlucky companions having lost their reason, felt neither anxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all that was offered them  So they were soon fat and there was an end of them, but I grew leaner day by day, for I ate but little, and even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me  However, as I was so far from being a tempting morsel, I was allowed to wander about freely, and one day, when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me, I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest, running faster the more he cried to me to come back, until I had completely distanced him  For seven days I hurried on, resting only when the darkness stopped me, and living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me both meat and drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore and saw a party of white men gathering pepper, which grew abundantly all about  Reassured by the nature of their occupation, I advanced towards them and they greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came  My delight was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willingly satisfied their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked, and captured by the blacks  "But these savages devour men!" said they  "How did you escape?" I repeated to them what I have just told you, at which they were mightily astonished  I stayed with them until they had collected as much pepper as they wished, and then they took me back to their own country and presented me to their king, by whom I was hospitably received  To him also I had to relate my adventures, which surprised him much, and when I had finished he ordered that I should be supplied with food and raiment and treated with consideration  The island on which I found myself was full of people, and abounded in all sorts of desirable things, and a great deal of traffic went on in the capital, where I soon began to feel at home and contented  Moreover, the king treated me with special favour, and in consequence of this everyone, whether at the court or in the town, sought to make life pleasant to me  One thing I remarked which I thought very strange; this was that, from the greatest to the least, all men rode their horses without bridle or stirrups  I one day presumed to ask his majesty why he did not use them, to which he replied, "You speak to me of things of which I have never before heard!" This gave me an idea  I found a clever workman, and made him cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle, which I wadded and covered with choice leather, adorning it with rich gold embroidery  I then got a lock-smith to make me a bit and a pair of spurs after a pattern that I drew for him, and when all these things were completed I presented them to the king and showed him how to use them  When I had saddled one of his horses he mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty, and to show his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts', " After this I had to make saddles for all the principal officers of the king's household, and as they all gave me rich presents I soon became very wealthy and quite an important person in the city", ' One day the king sent for me and said, "Sindbad, I am going to ask a favour of you  Both I and my subjects esteem you, and wish you to end your days amongst us There was once a little girl who was obstinate and inquisitive, and when her parents told her to do anything, she did not obey them, so how could she fare well  One day she said to her parents, I have heard so much of frau trude, I will go to her some day  People say that everything about her does look so strange, and that there are such odd things in her house, that I have become quite curious  Her parents absolutely forbade her, and said, frau trude is a bad woman, who does wicked things, and if you go to her, you are no longer our child  But the maiden did not let herself be turned aside by her parents, prohibition, and still went to frau trude  And when she got to her, frau trude said, why are you so pale  Ah, she replied, and her whole body trembled, I have been so terrified at what I have seen  What have you seen  I saw a black man on your steps  That was a collier  Then I saw a green man  That was a huntsman  After that I saw a blood-red man  That was a butcher  Ah, frau trude, I was terrified  I looked through the window and saw not you, but, as I verily believe, the devil himself with a head of fire  Oho  Said she, then you have seen the witch in her proper costume  I have been waiting for you, and wanting you a long time already  You shall give me some light  Then she changed the girl into a block of wood, and threw it into the fire  And when it was in a full blaze she sat down close to it, and warmed herself by it, and said, that shines bright for once in a way   There was once upon a time a man who was called frederick and a woman called catherine, who had married each other and lived together as young married folks  One day frederick said, I will now go and plough, catherine, when I come back, there must be some roast meat on the table for hunger, and a fresh draught for thirst  Just go, frederick, answered kate, just go, I will have all ready for you  So when dinner-time drew near she got a sausage out of the chimney, put it in the frying-pan, put some butter to it, and set it on the fire  The sausage began to fry and to hiss, catherine stood beside it and held the handle of the pan, and had her own thoughts as she was doing it  Then it occurred to her, while the sausage is getting done you could go into the cellar and draw beer  So she set the frying-pan safely on the fire, took a can, and went down into the cellar to draw beer  The beer ran into the can and kate watched it, and then she thought, oh, dear  The dog upstairs is not fastened up, it might get the sausage out of the pan  Lucky I thought of it  And in a trice she was up the cellar-steps again, but the spitz had the sausage in its mouth already, and trailed it away on the ground  But catherine, who was not idle, set out after it, and chased it a long way into the field, the dog, however, was swifter than catherine and did not let the sausage go, but skipped over the furrows with it', " What's gone is gone, said kate, and turned round, and as she had run till she was weary, she walked quietly and comfortably, and cooled herself", ' During this time the beer was still running out of the cask, for kate had not turned the tap  And when the can was full and there was no other place for it, it ran into the cellar and did not stop until the whole cask was empty  As soon as kate was on the steps she saw the accident  Good gracious, she cried  What shall I do now to stop frederick finding out  She thought for a while, and at last she remembered that up in the garret was still standing a sack of the finest wheat flour from the last fair, and she would fetch that down and strew it over the beer', " Yes, said she, he who saves a thing when he ought, has it afterwards when he needs it, and she climbed up to the garret and carried the sack below, and threw it straight down on the can of beer, which she knocked over, and frederick's draught swam also in the cellar", ' It is all right, said kate, where the one is the other ought to be also, and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar  When it was done she was heartily delighted with her work, and said, how clean and wholesome it does look here  At mid-day home came frederick, now, wife, what have you ready for me  Ah, freddy, she answered, I was frying a sausage for you, but whilst I was drawing the beer to drink with it, the dog took it away out of the pan, and whilst I was running after the dog, all the beer ran out, and whilst I was drying up the beer with the flour, I knocked over the can as well, but be easy, the cellar is quite dry again  Said frederick, kate, kate, you should not have done that, to let the sausage be carried off and the beer run out of the cask, and throw out all our flour into the bargain  Well, frederick, I did not know that, you should have told me  The man thought, if this is the kind of wife I have, I had better take more care of things', " Now he had saved up a good number of talers which he changed into gold, and said to catherine, look, these are yellow counters for playing games, I will put them in a pot and bury them in the stable under the cow's manger, but mind you keep away from them, or it will be the worse for you", ' Said she, oh, no, frederick, I certainly will not go near them  And when frederick was gone some pedlars came into the village who had cheap earthen bowls and pots, and asked the young woman if there was nothing she wanted to bargain with them for  On a desolate plain, a little shepherd-boy stood alone', " His day's work was over and he had wandered through field and forest listening to the twittering of the birds and the soft sound of the summer breezes as they gently swayed the branches of the trees", ' He seemed to understand what the birds were saying, and the murmuring of the brook that wound its way through the forest was like a message of Nature to him  Sweet sounds were always in his ears, his heart was ever singing, for the shepherd-boy was a poet  At times he would turn around sharply, thinking he had heard some one calling  One day he was quite startled  "David, David," he thought he heard a voice calling, "thou shalt be King of Israel " But he could see nothing, except the trees and the flowers, and so he left the forest and stood in the desolate plain  In the distance he saw a very high hill and as he approached nearer he noticed on the summit a tall tree, without branches or leaves  With great difficulty he climbed the hill  It was quite smooth, bare of vegetation and without rocks, and little David noticed that it gave forth none of those sweet sounds like music that came from other hills  The summit gained, he looked at the tree in wonderment  It was not of wood, but of horn  "\'Tis strange," said the boy  "This must be a magic mountain  No tree, or flower, or shrub, can grow in this barren earth " He tried to dig a clod of earth out of the ground, but could not do so, even with his knife, for the ground was as hard as if covered with tough hide  David was greatly puzzled, but, being a boy of courage, he did not begin to run down the mountain  "I wonder what will happen if I stay here," he said, and he seated himself at the foot of the mysterious horn that grew at the summit and looked about him  Then he noticed a most peculiar thing  The ground was rising and falling in places as if moved by some power beneath  Listening intently, he also heard a curious rumbling noise, and then a loud-sounding swish  At the same time he saw something rising from the other end of the mountain and whirl through the air  "That is just like a tail," exclaimed David in surprise  The next minute he had to cling with all his might to the horn, for the whole mountain was moving  It was rising, and soon David was quite near the clouds  The earth was a great distance away, and, judging by a tremendous shadow cast by the sun, David could see that he was clinging to the horn of a gigantic animal  "I know what it is now," he said  "This is not a mountain, but a unicorn  The monster must have been lying asleep when I mistook it for a hill  The children, in their little sheepskin coats and high felt boots and fur hats, trudged along the forest path in the snow  Vanya went first, then Maroosia, and then old Peter  The ground was white and the snow was hard and crisp, and all over the forest could be heard the crackling of the frost  And as they walked, old Peter told them the story of the old woman who wanted Frost to marry her daughters  Once upon a time there were an old man and an old woman', " Now the old woman was the old man's second wife", ' His first wife had died, and had left him with a little daughter: Martha she was called  Then he married again, and God gave him a cross wife, and with her two more daughters, and they were very different from the first  The old woman loved her own daughters, and gave them red kisel jelly every day, and honey too, as much as they could put into their greedy little mouths  But poor little Martha, the eldest, she got only what the others left  When they were cross they threw away what they left, and then she got nothing at all  The children grew older, and the stepmother made Martha do all the work of the house  She had to fetch the wood for the stove, and light it and keep it burning  She had to draw the water for her sisters to wash their hands in  She had to make the clothes, and wash them and mend them  She had to cook the dinner, and clean the dishes after the others had done before having a bite for herself  For all that the stepmother was never satisfied, and was for ever shouting at her: "Look, the kettle is in the wrong place;" "There is dust on the floor;" "There is a spot on the tablecloth;" or, "The spoons are not clean, you stupid, ugly, idle hussy " But Martha was not idle  She worked all day long, and got up before the sun, while her sisters never stirred from their beds till it was time for dinner  And she was not stupid  She always had a song on her lips, except when her stepmother had beaten her  And as for being ugly, she was the prettiest little girl in the village  Her father saw all this, but he could not do anything, for the old woman was mistress at home, and he was terribly afraid of her  And as for the daughters, they saw how their mother treated Martha, and they did the same  They were always complaining and getting her into trouble  It was a pleasure to them to see the tears on her pretty cheeks  Well, time went on, and the little girl grew up, and the daughters of the stepmother were as ugly as could be  Their eyes were always cross, and their mouths were always complaining  Their mother saw that no one would want to marry either of them while there was Martha about the house, with her bright eyes and her songs and her kindness to everybody  So she thought of a way to get rid of her stepdaughter, and a cruel way it was There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there  He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree  The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself, you will take him home with you, and bring him up with your lina  He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together  And the one, which he had found on a tree was called fundevogel, because a bird had carried it away  Fundevogel and lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad  Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to the spring  Lina saw this and said, listen old sanna, why are you fetching so much water  If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will tell you why  So lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the cook said, early tomorrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in fundevogel, and will boil him in it  Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he was gone the children were still in bed  Then lina said to fundevogel, if you will never leave me, I too will never leave you  Fundevogel said, neither now, nor ever will I leave you  Then said lina, then I will tell you  Last night, old sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone she would tell me, and I said I would be sure not to tell anyone, and she said that early to-morrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you, but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together  The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went away  When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bed-room to fetch fundevogel and throw him into it  But when she came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone  Then she was terribly alarmed, and she said to herself, what shall I say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone  They must be followed instantly to get them back again  Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and overtake the children  The children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, lina said to fundevoel, never leave me, and I will never leave you  Fundevogel said, neither now, nor ever  Then said lina, do you become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it  When the three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but the children were nowhere  Then said they, there is nothing to be done here, and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it  Then the old cook scolded and said, you simpletons, you simpletons, you should have cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with you, go, and do it once  They had therefore to go out and look for the second time  The children, however, saw them coming from a distance  Then lina said, fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave you Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and for that reason people never called him anything but gambling Hansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house and all that he had  Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the Lord and St  Peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night  Then gambling Hansel said, for my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat  So the Lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which gambling Hansel made no objection  Thereupon St', " Peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker's and fetch some bread", ' So gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, Hansel, do come in  Oh, said he, do you want to win three groschen too  On this they would not let him go  So he went in, and played away the three groschen also  Meanwhile St  Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him  When gambling Hansel came, however, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter, and kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but our Lord already knew that he had lost it in play  St  Peter again gave him three groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more, but fetched them the loaf  Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, alack, sir, the casks are all empty  But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best wine was still there  For a long time he would not believe this, but at length he said, well, I will go down, but I know that there is none there  When he turned the tap, however, lo and behold, the best of wine ran out  So he took it to them, and the two passed the night there  Early next day our Lord told gambling Hansel that he might beg three favors  The Lord expected that he would ask to go to heaven, but gambling Hansel asked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything, for dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree whereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who had climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so  The Lord gave him all that he had asked, and departed with St  Peter  And now gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real earnest, and before long he had gained half the world  Upon this St  Peter said to the Lord, Lord, this thing must not go on, at last he will win the whole world  We must send death to him  And they sent death to him He must have slept a long time, for when he awoke he felt wonderfully restored--indeed almost well--and very hungry  There were voices in the outer cave  Once more, then, it was night; for the goblins slept during the day and went about their affairs during the night  In the universal and constant darkness of their dwelling they had no reason to prefer the one arrangement to the other; but from aversion to the sun-people they chose to be busy when there was least chance of their being met either by the miners below, when they were burrowing, or by the people of the mountain above, when they were feeding their sheep or catching their goats  And indeed it was only when the sun was away that the outside of the mountain was sufficiently like their own dismal regions to be endurable to their mole eyes, so thoroughly had they become unaccustomed to any light beyond that of their own fires and torches  Curdie listened, and soon found that they were talking of himself', " 'How long will it take?' asked Harelip", " 'Not many days, I should think,' answered the king", " 'They are poor feeble creatures, those sun-people, and want to be always eating", " We can go a week at a time without food, and be all the better for it; but I've been told they eat two or three times every day! Can you believe it? They must be quite hollow inside--not at all like us, nine-tenths of whose bulk is solid flesh and bone", ' Yes--I judge a week of starvation will do for him', "' 'If I may be allowed a word,' interposed the queen,--'and I think I ought to have some voice in the matter--' 'The wretch is entirely at your disposal, my spouse,' interrupted the king", " 'He is your property", ' You caught him yourself  We should never have done it', "' The queen laughed", ' She seemed in far better humour than the night before', " 'I was about to say,' she resumed, 'that it does seem a pity to waste so much fresh meat", "' 'What are you thinking of, my love?' said the king", " 'The very notion of starving him implies that we are not going to give him any meat, either salt or fresh", "' 'I'm not such a stupid as that comes to,' returned Her Majesty", " 'What I mean is that by the time he is starved there will hardly be a picking upon his bones", "' The king gave a great laugh", " 'Well, my spouse, you may have him when you like,' he said", " 'I don't fancy him for my part", ' I am pretty sure he is tough eating', "' 'That would be to honour instead of punish his insolence,' returned the queen", " 'But why should our poor creatures be deprived of so much nourishment? Our little dogs and cats and pigs and small bears would enjoy him very much", "' 'You are the best of housekeepers, my lovely queen!' said her husband", " 'Let it be so by all means" ,  'There were once upon a time two sisters, one of whom had no children and was rich, and the other had five and was a widow, and so poor that she no longer had food enough to satisfy herself and her children  In her need, therefore, she went to her sister, and said, my children and I are suffering the greatest hunger  You are rich, give me a mouthful of bread  The very rich sister was as hard as a stone, and said, I myself have nothing in the house, and drove away the poor creature with harsh words  After some time the husband of the rich sister came home, and was just going to cut himself a piece of bread, but when he made the first cut into the loaf, out flowed red blood  When the woman saw that she was terrified and told him what had occurred  He hurried away to help the widow and her children, but when he entered her room, he found her praying  She had her two youngest children in her arms, and the three eldest were lying dead  He offered her food, but she answered, for earthly food have we no longer any desire  God has already satisfied the hunger of three of us, and he will hearken to our supplications likewise  Scarcely had she uttered these words than the two little ones drew their last breath, whereupon her heart broke, and she sank down dead   A poor man had twelve children and was forced to work night and day to give them even bread  When therefore the thirteenth came into the world, he knew not what to do in his trouble, but ran out into the great highway, and resolved to ask the first person whom he met to be godfather  The first to meet him was the good God who already knew what filled his heart, and said to him, poor man, I pity you  I will hold your child at its christening, and will take charge of it and make it happy on earth  The man said, who are you  I am God  Then I do not desire to have you for a godfather, said the man, you give to the rich, and leave the poor to hunger  Thus spoke the man, for he did not know how wisely God apportions riches and poverty  He turned therefore away from the Lord, and went farther  Then the devil came to him and said, what do you seek  If you will take me as a godfather for your child, I will give him gold in plenty and all the joys of the world as well  The man asked, who are you  I am the devil  Then I do not desire to have you for godfather, said the man, you deceive men and lead them astray  He went onwards, and then came death striding up to him with withered legs, and said, take me as godfather  The man asked, who are you  I am death, and I make all equal  Then said the man, you are the right one, you take the rich as well as the poor, without distinction, you shall be godfather  Death answered, I will make your child rich and famous, for he who has me for a friend can lack nothing  The man said, next sunday is the christening, be there at the right time  Death appeared as he had promised, and stood godfather quite in the usual way  When the boy had grown up, his godfather one day appeared and bade him go with him', " He led him forth into a forest, and showed him a herb which grew there, and said, now you shall receive your godfather's present", ' I make you a celebrated physician  When you are called to a patient, I will always appear to you', " If I stand by the head of the sick man, you may say with confidence that you will make him well again, and if you give him of this herb he will recover, but if I stand by the patient's feet, he is mine, and you must say that all remedies are in vain, and that no physician in the world could save him", ' But beware of using the herb against my will, or it might fare ill with you  It was not long before the youth was the most famous physician in the whole world  He had only to look at the patient and he knew his condition at once, whether he would recover, or must needs die  So they said of him, and from far and wide people came to him, sent for him when they had anyone ill, and gave him so much money that he soon became a rich man There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel, but his mother said, how can you travel  We have no money at all for you to take away with you  Then said the son, I will manage very well for myself  I will always say, not much, not much, not much  So he walked for a long time and always said, not much, not much, not much  Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, God speed you  Not much, not much, not much  What do you say, churl, not much  And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish  So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, have you never seen me threshing  What ought I to say, then, asked the youth  You must say - get it full, get it full  After this he again walked a long time, and said, get it full, get it full, until he came to the gallows, where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang  Then said he, good morning, get it full, get it full  What do you say, knave, get it full  Do you want to make out that there are still more wicked people in the world  Is not this enough  And he again got some blows on his back  What am I to say, then, said he  You must say, may God have pity on the poor soul  Again the youth walked on for along while and said, may God have pity on the poor soul  Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse  The youth said, good morning  God have pity on the poor soul  What do you say, you ill-tempered knave, and the knacker gave him such a box on the ear, that he could not see out of his eyes  What am I to say, then  You must say, let the carrion lie in the pit  So he walked on, and always said, let the carrion lie in the pit, let the carrion lie in the pit  And he came to a cart full of people, so he said, good morning, let the carrion lie in the pit  Then the cart fell into a pit, and the driver took his whip and cracked it upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went out a traveling again  Once upon a time there was a king who had a wife, whose name was Silver-tree, and a daughter, whose name was Gold-tree  On a certain day of the days, Gold-tree and Silver-tree went to a glen, where there was a well, and in it there was a trout  Said Silver-tree, "Troutie, bonny little fellow, am not I the most beautiful queen in the world?" "Oh! indeed you are not " "Who then?" "Why, Gold-tree, your daughter " Silver-tree went home, blind with rage  She lay down on the bed, and vowed she would never be well until she could get the heart and the liver of Gold-tree, her daughter, to eat  At nightfall the king came home, and it was told him that Silver-tree, his wife, was very ill  He went where she was, and asked her what was wrong with her  "Oh! only a thing--which you may heal if you like " "Oh! indeed there is nothing at all which I could do for you that I would not do " "If I get the heart and the liver of Gold-tree, my daughter, to eat, I shall be well " Now it happened about this time that the son of a great king had come from abroad to ask Gold-tree for marrying  The king now agreed to this, and they went abroad  The king then went and sent his lads to the hunting-hill for a he-goat, and he gave its heart and its liver to his wife to eat; and she rose well and healthy  A year after this Silver-tree went to the glen, where there was the well in which there was the trout  "Troutie, bonny little fellow," said she, "am not I the most beautiful queen in the world?" "Oh! indeed you are not " "Who then?" "Why, Gold-tree, your daughter " "Oh! well, it is long since she was living  It is a year since I ate her heart and liver " "Oh! indeed she is not dead  She is married to a great prince abroad " Silver-tree went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in order, and said, "I am going to see my dear Gold-tree, for it is so long since I saw her " The long-ship was put in order, and they went away  It was Silver-tree herself that was at the helm, and she steered the ship so well that they were not long at all before they arrived  The prince was out hunting on the hills  Gold-tree knew the long-ship of her father coming  "Oh!" said she to the servants, "my mother is coming, and she will kill me " "She shall not kill you at all; we will lock you in a room where she cannot get near you " This is how it was done; and when Silver-tree came ashore, she began to cry out: "Come to meet your own mother, when she comes to see you," Gold-tree said that she could not, that she was locked in the room, and that she could not get out of it  "Will you not put out," said Silver-tree, "your little finger through the key-hole, so that your own mother may give a kiss to it?" She put out her little finger, and Silver-tree went and put a poisoned stab in it, and Gold-tree fell dead The she-wolf brought into the world a young one, and invited the fox to be godfather  After all, he is a near relative of ours, said she, he has a good understanding, and much talent, he can instruct my little son, and help him forward in the world  The fox, too, appeared quite honest, and said, worthy mrs  Gossip, I thank you for the honor which you are doing me, I will, however, conduct myself in such a way that you shall be repaid for it  He enjoyed himself at the feast, and made merry, afterwards he said, dear mrs  Gossip, it is our duty to take care of the child, it must have good food that it may be strong  I know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice morsel  The wolf was pleased with the idea, and she went out with the fox to the farmyard  He pointed out the fold from afar, and said, you will be able to creep in there without being seen, and in the meantime I will look about on the other side to see if I can pick up a chicken  He, however, did not go there, but sat down at the entrance to the forest, stretched his legs and rested  The she-wolf crept into the stable  A dog was lying there, and it made such a noise that the peasants came running out, caught gossip wolf, and poured a strong burning mixture, which had been prepared for washing, over her skin  At last she escaped, and dragged herself outside  There lay the fox, who pretended to be full of complaints, and said, ah, dear mrs  Gossip, how ill I have fared, the peasants have fallen on me, and have broken every limb I have, if you do not want me to lie where I am and perish, you must carry me away  The she-wolf herself was only able to walk slowly, but she was in such concern about the fox that she took him on her back, and slowly carried him who was perfectly safe and sound to her house  Then the fox cried to her, farewell, dear mrs  Gossip, may the roasting you have had do you good, laughed heartily at her, and bounded off    ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen who had one charming daughter  She was so graceful and pretty and clever that she was called Graciosa, and the Queen was so fond of her that she could think of nothing else  Everyday she gave the Princess a lovely new frock of gold brocade, or satin, or velvet, and when she was hungry she had bowls full of sugar-plums, and at least twenty pots of jam  Everybody said she was the happiest Princess in the world  Now there lived at this same court a very rich old duchess whose name was Grumbly  She was more frightful than tongue can tell; her hair was red as fire, and she had but one eye, and that not a pretty one! Her face was as broad as a full moon, and her mouth was so large that everybody who met her would have been afraid they were going to be eaten up, only she had no teeth  As she was as cross as she was ugly, she could not bear to hear everyone saying how pretty and how charming Graciosa was; so she presently went away from the court to her own castle, which was not far off', " But if anybody who went to see her happened to mention the charming Princess, she would cry angrily: 'It's not true that she is lovely", ' I have more beauty in my little finger than she has in her whole body', "' Soon after this, to the great grief of the Princess, the Queen was taken ill and died, and the King became so melancholy that for a whole year he shut himself up in his palace", ' At last his physicians, fearing that he would fall ill, ordered that he should go out and amuse himself; so a hunting party was arranged, but as it was very hot weather the King soon got tired, and said he would dismount and rest at a castle which they were passing', " This happened to be the Duchess Grumbly's castle, and when she heard that the King was coming she went out to meet him, and said that the cellar was the coolest place in the whole castle if he would condescend to come down into it", ' So down they went together, and the King seeing about two hundred great casks ranged side by side, asked if it was only for herself that she had this immense store of wine', " 'Yes, sire,' answered she, 'it is for myself alone, but I shall be most happy to let you taste some of it", ' Which do you like, canary, St', " Julien, champagne, hermitage sack, raisin, or cider?' 'Well,' said the King, 'since you are so kind as to ask me, I prefer champagne to anything else", "' Then Duchess Grumbly took up a little hammer and tapped upon the cask twice, and out came at least a thousand crowns", " 'What's the meaning of this?' said she smiling", ' Then she tapped the next cask, and out came a bushel of gold pieces', " 'I don't understand this at all,' said the Duchess, smiling more than before", ' Then she went on to the third cask, tap, tap, and out came such a stream of diamonds and pearls that the ground was covered with them', " 'Ah!' she cried, 'this is altogether beyond my comprehension, sire", ' Someone must have stolen my good wine and put all this rubbish in its place', "' 'Rubbish, do you call it, Madam Grumbly?' cried the King", " 'Rubbish! why there is enough there to buy ten kingdoms", "' 'Well,' said she, 'you must know that all those casks are full of gold and jewels, and if you like to marry me it shall all be yours", "' Now the King loved money more than anything else in the world, so he cried joyfully: 'Marry you? why with all my heart! to-morrow if you like", "' 'But I make one condition,' said the Duchess; 'I must have entire control of your daughter to do as I please with her", "' 'Oh certainly, you shall have your own way; let us shake hands upon the bargain,' said the King", ' So they shook hands and went up out of the cellar of treasure together, and the Duchess locked the door and gave the key to the King There was once a boy in the County Mayo; Guleesh was his name  There was the finest rath a little way off from the gable of the house, and he was often in the habit of seating himself on the fine grass bank that was running round it  One night he stood, half leaning against the gable of the house, and looking up into the sky, and watching the beautiful white moon over his head  After he had been standing that way for a couple of hours, he said to himself: "My bitter grief that I am not gone away out of this place altogether', " I'd sooner be any place in the world than here", ' Och, it\'s well for you, white moon," says he, "that\'s turning round, turning round, as you please yourself, and no man can put you back  I wish I was the same as you " Hardly was the word out of his mouth when he heard a great noise coming like the sound of many people running together, and talking, and laughing, and making sport, and the sound went by him like a whirl of wind, and he was listening to it going into the rath  "Musha, by my soul," says he, "but ye\'re merry enough, and I\'ll follow ye " What was in it but the fairy host, though he did not know at first that it was they who were in it, but he followed them into the rath  It\'s there he heard the _fulparnee_, and the _folpornee_, the _rap-lay-hoota_, and the _roolya-boolya_, that they had there, and every man of them crying out as loud as he could: "My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!" "By my hand," said Guleesh, "my boy, that\'s not bad  I\'ll imitate ye," and he cried out as well as they: "My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!" And on the moment there was a fine horse with a bridle of gold, and a saddle of silver, standing before him  He leaped up on it, and the moment he was on its back he saw clearly that the rath was full of horses, and of little people going riding on them  Said a man of them to him: "Are you coming with us to-night, Guleesh?" "I am surely," said Guleesh  "If you are, come along," said the little man, and out they went all together, riding like the wind, faster than the fastest horse ever you saw a-hunting, and faster than the fox and the hounds at his tail', " The cold winter's wind that was before them, they overtook her, and the cold winter's wind that was behind them, she did not overtake them", ' And stop nor stay of that full race, did they make none, until they came to the brink of the sea  Then every one of them said: "Hie over cap! Hie over cap!" and that moment they were up in the air, and before Guleesh had time to remember where he was, they were down on dry land again, and were going like the wind  At last they stood still, and a man of them said to Guleesh: "Guleesh, do you know where you are now?" "Not a know," says Guleesh  "You\'re in France, Guleesh," said he  "The daughter of the king of France is to be married to-night, the handsomest woman that the sun ever saw, and we must do our best to bring her with us; if we\'re only able to carry her off; and you must come with us that we may be able to put the young girl up behind you on the horse, when we\'ll be bringing her away, for it\'s not lawful for us to put her sitting behind ourselves', " But you're flesh and blood, and she can take a good grip of you, so that she won't fall off the horse", ' Are you satisfied, Guleesh, and will you do what we\'re telling you?" "Why shouldn\'t I be satisfied?" said Guleesh  "I\'m satisfied, surely, and anything that ye will tell me to do I\'ll do it without doubt " They got off their horses there, and a man of them said a word that Guleesh did not understand, and on the moment they were lifted up, and Guleesh found himself and his companions in the palace  There was a great feast going on there, and there was not a nobleman or a gentleman in the kingdom but was gathered there, dressed in silk and satin, and gold and silver, and the night was as bright as the day with all the lamps and candles that were lit, and Guleesh had to shut his two eyes at the brightness  When he opened them again and looked from him, he thought he never saw anything as fine as all he saw there  There were a hundred tables spread out, and their full of meat and drink on each table of them, flesh-meat, and cakes and sweetmeats, and wine and ale, and every drink that ever a man saw', " The musicians were at the two ends of the hall, and they were playing the sweetest music that ever a man's ear heard, and there were young women and fine youths in the middle of the hall, dancing and turning, and going round so quickly and so lightly, that it put a _soorawn_ in Guleesh's head to be looking at them", ' There were more there playing tricks, and more making fun and laughing, for such a feast as there was that day had not been in France for twenty years, because the old king had no children alive but only the one daughter, and she was to be married to the son of another king that night  Once upon a time there lived two peasants who had three daughters, and, as generally happens, the youngest was the most beautiful and the best tempered, and when her sisters wanted to go out she was always ready to stay at home and do their work  Years passed quickly with the whole family, and one day the parents suddenly perceived that all three girls were grown up, and that very soon they would be thinking of marriage', " 'Have you decided what your husband's name is to be?' said the father, laughingly, to his eldest daughter, one evening when they were all sitting at the door of their cottage", " 'You know that is a very important point!' 'Yes; I will never wed any man who is not called Sigmund,' answered she", " 'Well, it is lucky for you that there are a great many Sigmunds in this part of the world,' replied her father, 'so that you can take your choice! And what do YOU say?' he added, turning to the second", " 'Oh, I think that there is no name so beautiful as Sigurd,' cried she", " 'Then you won't be an old maid either,' answered he", " 'There are seven Sigurds in the next village alone! And you, Helga?' Helga, who was still the prettiest of the three, looked up", " She also had her favourite name, but, just as she was going to say it, she seemed to hear a voice whisper: 'Marry no one who is not called Habogi", "' The girl had never heard of such a name, and did not like it, so she determined to pay no attention; but as she opened her mouth to tell her father that her husband must be called Njal, she found herself answering instead: 'If I do marry it will be to no one except Habogi", "' 'Who IS Habogi?' asked her father and sisters; 'We never heard of such a person", "' 'All I can tell you is that he will be my husband, if ever I have one,' returned Helga; and that was all she would say", ' Before very long the young men who lived in the neighbouring villages or on the sides of the mountains, had heard of this talk of the three girls, and Sigmunds and Sigurds in scores came to visit the little cottage', " There were other young men too, who bore different names, though not one of them was called 'Habogi,' and these thought that they might perhaps gain the heart of the youngest", " But though there was more than one 'Njal' amongst them, Helga's eyes seemed always turned another way", ' At length the two elder sisters made their choice from out of the Sigurds and the Sigmunds, and it was decided that both weddings should take place at the same time', " Invitations were sent out to the friends and relations, and when, on the morning of the great day, they were all assembled, a rough, coarse old peasant left the crowd and came up to the brides' father", " 'My name is Habogi, and Helga must be my wife,' was all he said", ' And though Helga stood pale and trembling with surprise, she did not try to run away', " 'I cannot talk of such things just now,' answered the father, who could not bear the thought of giving his favourite daughter to this horrible old man, and hoped, by putting it off, that something might happen", ' But the sisters, who had always been rather jealous of Helga, were secretly pleased that their bridegrooms should outshine hers  When the feast was over, Habogi led up a beautiful horse from a field where he had left it to graze, and bade Helga jump up on its splendid saddle, all embroidered in scarlet and gold', " 'You shall come back again,' said he; 'but now you must see the house that you are to live in", "' And though Helga was very unwilling to go, something inside her forced her to obey", ' The old man settled her comfortably, then sprang up in front of her as easily as if he had been a boy, and, shaking the reins, they were soon out of sight', " After some miles they rode through a meadow with grass so green that Helga's eyes felt quite dazzled; and feeding on the grass were a quantity of large fat sheep, with the curliest and whitest wool in the world", " 'What lovely sheep! whose are they?' cried Helga", " 'Your Habogi's,' answered he, 'all that you see belongs to him; but the finest sheep in the whole herd, which has little golden bells hanging between its horns, you shall have for yourself", "' This pleased Helga very much, for she had never had anything of her own; and she smiled quite happily as she thanked Habogi for his present", ' They soon left the sheep behind them, and entered a large field with a river running through it, where a number of beautiful grey cows were standing by a gate waiting for a milk-maid to come and milk them Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, master, my time is up, now I should be glad to go back home to my mother, give me my wages  The master answered, you have served me faithfully and honestly, as the service was so shall the reward be  And he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head  Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home  As he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse  Ah, said Hans quite loud, what a fine thing it is to ride', " There you sit as on a chair, you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and cover the ground, you don't know how", ' The rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, hi, there, Hans, why do you go on foot, then  I must, answered he, for I have this lump to carry home, it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder  I will tell you what, said the rider, we will exchange, I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump  With all my heart, said Hans, but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it  The rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up, then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, if you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, jup  Jup  Hans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free  After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, jup  Jup  The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway  The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him', " Hans pulled himself together and stood up on his legs again, but he was vexed, and said to the countryman, it is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one's neck", ' Never again will I mount it', " Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one's milk, butter and cheese every day without fail", ' What would I not give to have such a cow  Well, said the countryman, if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse  Hans agreed with the greatest delight, the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away  Hans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain  If only I have a morsel of bread - and that can hardly fail me - I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like, if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk  My goodness, what more can I want  When he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great concern ate up what he had with him - his dinner and supper - and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer', " Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother's village", ' As it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans, whose uncle wanted to find him a rich wife  He therefore seated Hans behind the stove, and had it made very hot  Then he fetched a pot of milk and plenty of white bread, gave him a bright newly-coined farthing in his hand, and said, Hans, hold that farthing fast, crumble the white bread into the milk, and stay where you are, and do not stir from that spot till I come back  Yes, said Hans, I will do all that', " Then the uncle put on a pair of old patched trousers, went to a rich peasant's daughter in the next village, and said, won't you marry my nephew Hans", ' You will get an honest and sensible man who will suit you  The covetous father asked, how is it with regard to his means  Has he bread to break? Dear friend, replied the uncle, my young nephew has a snug berth, a nice bit of money in hand, and plenty of bread to break, besides he has quite as many patches as I have  And as he spoke, he slapped the patches on his trousers, but in that district small pieces of land were called patches also  If you will give yourself the trouble to go home with me, you shall see at once that all is as I have said  Then the miser did not want to lose this good opportunity, and said, if that is the case, I have nothing further to say against the marriage', " So the wedding was celebrated on the appointed day, and when the young wife went out of doors to see the bridegroom's property, Hans took off his sunday coat and put on his patched smock and said, I might spoil my good coat", ' Then together they went out and wherever a vineyard came in sight, or fields and meadows were divided from each other, Hans pointed with his finger and then slapped either a large or a small patch on his smock, and said, that patch is mine, and that too, my dearest, just look at it  Meaning thereby that his wife should not stare at the broad land, but look at his garment, which was his own  Were you at the wedding too? Yes, indeed I was there, and in full dress  My head-dress was of snow, then the sun came out, and it was melted  My coat was of cobwebs, and I had to pass by some thorns which tore it off me, my shoes were of glass, and I trod on a stone and they said, klink, and broke in two   \tHans the Hedgehog There was once a country man who had money and land in plenty, but however rich he was, his happiness was still lacking in one respect - he had no children  Often when he went into the town with the other peasants they mocked him and asked why he had no children  At last he became angry, and when he got home he said, "I will have a child, even if it be a hedgehog " Then his wife had a child that was a hedgehog in the upper part of his body and a boy in the lower, and when she saw the child, she was terrified, and said, "See, there you have brought ill-luck on us " Then said the man, "What can be done now? The boy must be christened, but we shall not be able to get a godfather for him " The woman said, "And we cannot call him anything else but Hans the hedgehog " When he was christened, the parson said, "He cannot go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes " So a little straw was put behind the stove, and Hans the hedgehog was laid on it  His mother could not suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills  So he lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, if he would but die  He did not die, however, but remained lying there  Now it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant was about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her  "A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house," said she  Then he asked the servant, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks  At last he said also, "And what will you have, Hans my hedgehog?" "Dear father," he said, "do bring me bagpipes " When, therefore, the father came home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her, meat and white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the stockings with clocks, and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and gave Hans the hedgehog the bagpipes  And when Hans the hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, "Dear father, do go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away, and never come back again " At this, the father was delighted to think that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for him, and when it was done, Hans the hedgehog got on it, and rode away, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in the forest  When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high tree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his asses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew nothing about him  And while he was sitting in the tree, he played his bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful  Once a king came traveling by who had lost his way and heard the music  He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came  He spied about, but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music  Then the king told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom  So Hans the hedgehog descended from the tree, and said he would show the way if the king would write a bond and promise him whatever he first met in the royal courtyard as soon as he arrived at home  Then the king thought, I can easily do that, Hans the hedgehog understands nothing, and I can write what I like  So the king took pen and ink and wrote something, and when he had done it, Hans the hedgehog showed him the way, and he got safely home  But his daughter, when she saw him from afar, was so overjoyed that she ran to meet him, and kissed him  Then he remembered Hans the hedgehog, and told her what had happened, and that he had been forced to promise whatsoever first met him when he got home, to a very strange animal which sat on a cock as if it were a horse, and made beautiful music, but that instead of writing that he should have what he wanted, he had written that he should not have it  Thereupon the princess was glad, and said he had done well, for she never would have gone away with the hedgehog  In a village there once lived a smith called Basmus, who was in a very poor way  He was still a young man, and a strong handsome fellow to boot, but he had many little children and there was little to be earned by his trade  He was, however, a diligent and hard-working man, and when he had no work in the smithy he was out at sea fishing, or gathering wreckage on the shore  It happened one time that he had gone out to fish in good weather, all alone in a little boat, but he did not come home that day, nor the following one, so that all believed he had perished out at sea  On the third day, however, Basmus came to shore again and had his boat full of fish, so big and fat that no one had ever seen their like  There was nothing the matter with him, and he complained neither of hunger or thirst  He had got into a fog, he said, and could not find land again  What he did not tell, however, was where he had been all the time; that only came out six years later, when people got to know that he had been caught by a mermaid out on the deep sea, and had been her guest during the three days that he was missing  From that time forth he went out no more to fish; nor, indeed, did he require to do so, for whenever he went down to the shore it never failed that some wreckage was washed up, and in it all kinds of valuable things  In those days everyone took what they found and got leave to keep it, so that the smith grew more prosperous day by day', " When seven years had passed since the smith went out to sea, it happened one morning, as he stood in the smithy, mending a plough, that a handsome young lad came in to him and said, 'Good-day, father; my mother the mermaid sends her greetings, and says that she has had me for six years now, and you can keep me for as long", "' He was a strange enough boy to be six years old, for he looked as if he were eighteen, and was even bigger and stronger than lads commonly are at that age", " 'Will you have a bite of bread?' said the smith", " 'Oh, yes,' said Hans, for that was his name", ' The smith then told his wife to cut a piece of bread for him  She did so, and the boy swallowed it at one mouthful and went out again to the smithy to his father', " 'Have you got all you can eat?' said the smith", " 'No,' said Hans, 'that was just a little bit", "' The smith went into the house and took a whole loaf, which he cut into two slices and put butter and cheese between them, and this he gave to Hans", ' In a while the boy came out to the smithy again', " 'Well, have you got as much as you can eat?' said the smith", " 'No, not nearly,' said Hans; 'I must try to find a better place than this, for I can see that I shall never get my fill here", "' Hans wished to set off at once, as soon as his father would make a staff for him of such a kind as he wanted", " 'It must be of iron,' said he, 'and one that can hold out", "' The smith brought him an iron rod as thick as an ordinary staff, but Hans took it and twisted it round his finger, so that wouldn't do", ' Then the smith came dragging one as thick as a waggon-pole, but Hans bent it over his knee and broke it like a straw  The smith then had to collect all the iron he had, and Hans held it while his father forged for him a staff, which was heavier than the anvil', " When Hans had got this he said, 'Many thanks, father; now I have got my inheritance", "' With this he set off into the country, and the smith was very pleased to be rid of that son, before he ate him out of house and home", ' Hans first arrived at a large estate, and it so happened that the squire himself was standing outside the farmyard Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children  The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel  He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread  Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, what is to become of us  How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves', " I'll tell you what, husband, answered the woman, early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest", ' There we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone  They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them  No, wife, said the man, I will not do that  How can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest   The wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces', " O' you fool, said she, then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins, and she left him no peace until he consented", ' But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same, said the man  The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father  Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, now all is over with us  Be quiet, Gretel, said Hansel, do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us  And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside  The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies  Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in  Then he went back and said to Gretel, be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us, and he lay down again in his bed  When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying get up, you sluggards  We are going into the forest to fetch wood  She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, there is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else  Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket  Then they all set out together on the way to the forest  When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again  His father said, Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for  Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs  Ah, father, said Hansel, I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me  The wife said, fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys  Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor woodcutter, with his wife and two children by his former marriage, a little boy called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel  He had little enough to break or bite; and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could not procure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed one evening, rolling about for trouble, he sighed, and said to his wife, "What will become of us? How can we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat ourselves?" "Know, then, my husband," answered she, "we will lead them away, quite early in the morning, into the thickest part of the wood, and there make them a fire, and give them each a little piece of bread; then we will go to our work, and leave them alone, so they will not find the way home again, and we shall be freed from them " "No, wife," replied he, "that I can never do  How can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood, for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces?" "Oh, you simpleton!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger; you had better plane the coffins for us " But she left him no peace till he consented, saying, "Ah, but I shall regret the poor children " The two children, however, had not gone to sleep for very hunger, and so they overheard what the stepmother said to their father  Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, "What will become of us?" "Be quiet, Grethel," said he; "do not cry--I will soon help you " And as soon as their parents had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his coat, and, unbarring the back door, slipped out  The moon shone brilliantly, and the white pebbles which lay before the door seemed like silver pieces, they glittered so brightly  Hansel stooped down, and put as many into his pocket as it would hold; and then going back, he said to Grethel, "Be comforted, dear sister, and sleep in peace; God will not forsake us " And so saying, he went to bed again  The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the two children  "Get up, you lazy things; we are going into the forest to chop wood " Then she gave them each a piece of bread, saying, "There is something for your dinner; do not eat it before the time, for you will get nothing else " Grethel took the bread in her apron, for Hansel\'s pocket was full of pebbles; and so they all set out upon their way  When they had gone a little distance, Hansel stood still, and peeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till his father said, "Hansel, what are you peeping at, and why do you lag behind? Take care, and remember your legs " "Ah, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house, and trying to say good-bye " "You simpleton!" said the wife, "that is not a cat; it is only the sun shining on the white chimney " But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time he stopped, he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path  When they came to the middle of the forest, the father told the children to collect wood, and he would make them a fire, so that they should not be cold  So Hansel and Grethel gathered together quite a little mountain of twigs  Then they set fire to them; and as the flame burnt up high, the wife said, "Now, you children, lie down near the fire, and rest yourselves, while we go into the forest and chop wood; when we are ready, I will come and call you " Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon, each ate the piece of bread; and because they could hear the blows of an axe, they thought their father was near: but it was not an axe, but a branch which he had bound to a withered tree, so as to be blown to and fro by the wind  They waited so long that at last their eyes closed from weariness, and they fell fast asleep  When they awoke, it was quite dark, and Grethel began to cry, "How shall we get out of the wood?" But Hansel tried to comfort her by saying, "Wait a little while till the moon rises, and then we will quickly find the way " The moon soon shone forth, and Hansel, taking his sister\'s hand, followed the pebbles, which glittered like new-coined silver pieces, and showed them the path', " All night long they walked on, and as day broke they came to their father's house", ' They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, "You wicked children! why did you sleep so long in the wood? We thought you were never coming home again " But their father was very glad, for it had grieved his heart to leave them all alone  Not long afterward there was again great scarcity in every corner of the land; and one night the children overheard their stepmother saying to their father, "Everything is again consumed; we have only half a loaf left, and then the song is ended: the children must be sent away  There was a certain Brahman in a certain village, named Harisarman  He was poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment, and he had very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds in a former life  He wandered about begging with his family, and at last he reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich householder called Sthuladatta', " His sons became keepers of Sthuladatta's cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him, and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an attendant", ' One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the daughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the bridegroom, and merry-makers  Harisarman hoped that he would be able to fill himself up to the throat with ghee and flesh and other dainties, and get the same for his family, in the house of his patron  While he was anxiously expecting to be fed, no one thought of him  Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his wife at night, "It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am treated with such disrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an artifice to possess a knowledge of magic, so that I may become an object of respect to this Sthuladatta; so, when you get an opportunity, tell him that I possess magical knowledge " He said this to her, and after turning the matter over in his mind, while people were asleep he took away from the house of Sthuladatta a horse on which his master\'s son-in-law rode  He placed it in concealment at some distance, and in the morning the friends of the bridegroom could not find the horse, though they searched in every direction  Then, while Sthuladatta was distressed at the evil omen, and searching for the thieves who had carried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came and said to him, "My husband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and magical sciences; he can get the horse back for you; why do you not ask him?" When Sthuladatta heard that, he called Harisarman, who said, "Yesterday I was forgotten, but to-day, now the horse is stolen, I am called to mind," and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman with these words--"I forgot you, forgive me"--and asked him to tell him who had taken away their horse  Then Harisarman drew all kinds of pretended diagrams, and said: "The horse has been placed by thieves on the boundary line south from this place  It is concealed there, and before it is carried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day, go quickly and bring it " When they heard that, many men ran and brought the horse quickly, praising the discernment of Harisarman  Then Harisarman was honoured by all men as a sage, and dwelt there in happiness, honoured by Sthuladatta  Now, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been stolen by a thief from the palace of the king  As the thief was not known, the king quickly summoned Harisarman on account of his reputation for knowledge of magic  And he, when summoned, tried to gain time, and said, "I will tell you to-morrow," and then he was placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully guarded  And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge  Now in that palace there was a maid named Jihva (which means Tongue), who, with the assistance of her brother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the palace', " She, being alarmed at Harisarman's knowledge, went at night and applied her ear to the door of that chamber in order to find out what he was about", ' And Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that very moment blaming his own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of knowledge  He said: "O Tongue, what is this that you have done through your greediness? Wicked one, you will soon receive punishment in full " When Jihva heard this, she thought, in her terror, that she had been discovered by this wise man, and she managed to get in where he was, and falling at his feet, she said to the supposed wizard: "Brahman, here I am, that Jihva whom you have discovered to be the thief of the treasure, and after I took it I buried it in the earth in a garden behind the palace, under a pomegranate tree  So spare me, and receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession " When Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly: "Depart, I know all this; I know the past, present and future; but I will not denounce you, being a miserable creature that has implored my protection  But whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me " When he said this to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly  But Harisarman reflected in his astonishment: "Fate brings about, as if in sport, things impossible, for when calamity was so near, who would have thought chance would have brought us success? While I was blaming my jihva, the thief Jihva suddenly flung herself at my feet  Secret crimes manifest themselves by means of fear  Once upon a time there were a King and a Queen who had an only daughter, called Hadvor, who was fair and beautiful, and being an only child, was heir to the kingdom  The King and Queen had also a foster son, named Hermod, who was just about the same age as Hadvor, and was good-looking, as well as clever at most things  Hermod and Hadvor often played together while they were children, and liked each other so much that while they were still young they secretly plighted their troth to each other  As time went on the Queen fell sick, and suspecting that it was her last illness, sent for the King to come to her  When he came she told him that she had no long time to live, and therefore wished to ask one thing of him, which was, that if he married another wife he should promise to take no other one than the Queen of Hetland the Good  The King gave the promise, and thereafter the Queen died  Time went past, and the King, growing tired of living alone, fitted out his ship and sailed out to sea  As he sailed there came upon him so thick a mist that he altogether lost his bearings, but after long trouble he found land  There he laid his ship to, and went on shore all alone  After walking for some time he came to a forest, into which he went a little way and stopped  Then he heard sweet music from a harp, and went in the direction of the sound until he came to a clearing, and there he saw three women, one of whom sat on a golden chair, and was beautifully and grandly dressed; she held a harp in her hands, and was very sorrowful', " The second was also finely dressed, but younger in appearance, and also sat on a chair, but it was not so grand as the first one's", ' The third stood beside them, and was very pretty to look at; she had a green cloak over her other clothes, and it was easy to see that she was maid to the other two  After the King had looked at them for a little he went forward and saluted them  The one that sat on the golden chair asked him who he was and where he was going; and he told her all the story--how he was a king, and had lost his queen, and was now on his way to Hetland the Good, to ask the Queen of that country in marriage  She answered that fortune had contrived this wonderfully, for pirates had plundered Hetland and killed the King, and she had fled from the land in terror, and had come hither after great trouble, and she was the very person he was looking for, and the others were her daughter and maid  The King immediately asked her hand; she gladly received his proposal and accepted him at once  Thereafter they all set out, and made their way to the ship; and after that nothing is told of their voyage until the King reached his own country  There he made a great feast, and celebrated his marriage with this woman; and after that things are quiet for a time', " Hermod and Hadvor took but little notice of the Queen and her daughter, but, on the other hand, Hadvor and the Queen's maid, whose name was Olof, were very friendly, and Olof came often to visit Hadvor in her castle", ' Before long the King went out to war, and no sooner was he away than the Queen came to talk with Hermod, and said that she wanted him to marry her daughter  Hermod told her straight and plain that he would not do so, at which the Queen grew terribly angry, and said that in that case neither should he have Hadvor, for she would now lay this spell on him, that he should go to a desert island and there be a lion by day and a man by night', " He should also think always of Hadvor, which would cause him all the more sorrow, and from this spell he should never be freed until Hadvor burned the lion's skin, and that would not happen very soon", ' As soon as the Queen had finished her speech Hermod replied that he also laid a spell on her, and that was, that as soon as he was freed from her enchantments she should become a rat and her daughter a mouse, and fight with each other in the hall until he killed them with his sword  After this Hermod disappeared, and no one knew what had become of him; the Queen caused search to be made for him, but he could nowhere be found  One time, when Olof was in the castle beside Hadvor, she asked the Princess if she knew where Hermod had gone to  At this Hadvor became very sad, and said that she did not', " 'I shall tell you then,' said Olof, 'for I know all about it", ' Hermod has disappeared through the wicked devices of the Queen, for she is a witch, and so is her daughter, though they have put on these beautiful forms', " Because Hermod would not fall in with the Queen's plans, and marry her daughter, she has laid a spell on him, to go on an island and be a lion by day and a man by night, and never be freed from this until you burn the lion's skin" ,  'There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey together  So the cock built a beautiful carriage, which had four red wheels, and harnessed four mice to it  The hen seated herself in it with the cock, and they drove away together  Not long afterwards they met a cat who said, where are you going  The cock replied, we are going to the house of herr korbes  Take me with you, said the cat  The cock answered, most willingly, get up behind, lest you fall off in front  Take great care not to dirty my little red wheels  And you little wheels, roll on, and you little mice pipe out, as we go forth on our way to the house of herr korbes  After this came a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin, and at last a needle, who all seated themselves in the carriage, and drove with them  When they reached the house of herr korbes, however, herr korbes was not there  The mice drew the carriage into the barn, the hen flew with the cock upon a perch  The cat sat down by the hearth, the duck on the well-pole  The egg rolled itself into a towel, the pin stuck itself into the chair-cushion, the needle jumped on to the bed in the middle of the pillow, and the millstone laid itself over the door  Then herr korbes came home, went to the hearth, and was about to light the fire, when the cat threw a quantity of ashes in his face  He ran into the kitchen in a great hurry to wash it off, and the duck splashed some water in his face  He wanted to dry it with the towel, but the egg rolled up against him, broke, and glued up his eyes  He wanted to rest, and sat down in the chair, and then the pin pricked him  He fell in a passion, and threw himself on his bed, but as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, the needle pricked him, so that he screamed aloud, and was just going to run out into the wide world in his rage, but when he came to the house-door, the millstone fell down and struck him dead  Herr korbes must have been a very wicked man   There was once a man who understood all kinds of arts  He served in war, and behaved well and bravely, but when the war was over he received his dismissal, and three farthings for his expenses on the way  Wait, said he, I shall not be content with this  If I can only meet with the right people, the king will yet have to give me all the treasure of the country  Then full of anger he went into the forest, and saw a man standing therein who had plucked up six trees as if they were blades of corn  He said to him, will you be my servant and go with me  Yes, he answered, but, first, I will take this little bundle of sticks home to my mother, and he took one of the trees, and wrapped it round the five others, lifted the bundle on his back, and carried it away  Then he returned and went with his master, who said, we two ought to be able to get through the world very well, and when they had walked on for a short while they found a huntsman who was kneeling, had shouldered his gun, and was about to fire  The master said to him, huntsman, what are you going to shoot  He answered, two miles from here a fly is sitting on the branch of an oak-tree, and I want to shoot its left eye out  Oh, come with me, said the man, if we three are together, we certainly ought to be able to get on in the world  The huntsman was ready, and went with him, and they came to seven windmills whose sails were turning round with great speed, and yet no wind was blowing either on the right or the left, and no leaf was stirring  Then said the man, I know not what is driving the windmills, not a breath of air is stirring, and he went onwards with his servants, and when they had walked two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree who was shutting one nostril, and blowing out of the other  Good gracious  What are you doing up there  He answered, two miles from here are seven windmills  Look, I am blowing them till they turn round  Oh, come with me, said the man  If we four are together, we shall carry the whole world before us  Then the blower came down and went with him, and after a while they saw a man who was standing on one leg and had taken off the other, and laid it beside him  Then the master said, you have arranged things very comfortably to have a rest  I am a runner, he replied, and to stop myself running far too fast, I have taken off one of my legs, for if I run with both, I go quicker than any bird can fly  Oh, go with me  If we five are together, we shall carry the whole world before us  So he went with them, and it was not long before they met a man who wore a cap, but wore it entirely over one ear', " Then the master said to him, gracefully, gracefully, don't stick your cap on one ear, you look just like a tom-fool", ' I must not wear it otherwise, said he, for if I set my hat straight, a terrible frost comes on, and all the birds in the air are frozen, and drop dead on the ground  Oh, come with me, said the master  If we six are together, we can carry the whole world before us  Now the six came to a town where the king had proclaimed that whosoever ran a race with his daughter and won the victory, should be her husband, but whosoever lost it, must lose his head  Once upon a time an old man and his wife lived together in a little village  They might have been happy if only the old woman had had the sense to hold her tongue at proper times', " But anything which might happen indoors, or any bit of news which her husband might bring in when he had been anywhere, had to be told at once to the whole village, and these tales were repeated and altered till it often happened that much mischief was made, and the old man's back paid for it", ' One day, he drove to the forest  When he reached the edge of it he got out of his cart and walked beside it  Suddenly he stepped on such a soft spot that his foot sank in the earth', " 'What can this be?' thought he", " 'I'll dig a bit and see", "' So he dug and dug, and at last he came on a little pot full of gold and silver", " 'Oh, what luck! Now, if only I knew how I could take this treasure home with me----but I can never hope to hide it from my wife, and once she knows of it she'll tell all the world, and then I shall get into trouble", "' He sat down and thought over the matter a long time, and at last he made a plan", ' He covered up the pot again with earth and twigs, and drove on into the town, where he bought a live pike and a live hare in the market  Then he drove back to the forest and hung the pike up at the very top of a tree, and tied up the hare in a fishing net and fastened it on the edge of a little stream, not troubling himself to think how unpleasant such a wet spot was likely to be to the hare  Then he got into his cart and trotted merrily home', " 'Wife!' cried he, the moment he got indoors", " 'You can't think what a piece of good luck has come our way", "' 'What, what, dear husband? Do tell me all about it at once", "' 'No, no, you'll just go off and tell everyone", "' 'No, indeed! How can you think such things! For shame! If you like I will swear never to----' 'Oh, well! if you are really in earnest then, listen", "' And he whispered in her ear: 'I've found a pot full of gold and silver in the forest! Hush!----' 'And why didn't you bring it back?' 'Because we'll drive there together and bring it carefully back between us", "' So the man and his wife drove to the forest", " As they were driving along the man said: 'What strange things one hears, wife! I was told only the other day that fish will now live and thrive in the tree tops and that some wild animals spend their time in the water", ' Well! well! times are certainly changed', "' 'Why, you must be crazy, husband! Dear, dear, what nonsense people do talk sometimes", "' 'Nonsense, indeed! Why, just look", " Bless my soul, if there isn't a fish, a real pike I do believe, up in that tree", "' 'Gracious!' cried his wife", " 'How did a pike get there? It IS a pike--you needn't attempt to say it's not", " Can people have said true----' But the man only shook his head and shrugged his shoulders and opened his mouth and gaped as if he really could not believe his own eyes", " 'What are you standing staring at there, stupid?' said his wife" ,  ' Many, many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a tennis-ball growing out of his right cheek  This lump was a great disfigurement to the old man, and so annoyed him that for many years he spent all his time and money in trying to get rid of it  He tried everything he could think of  He consulted many doctors far and near, and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally  But it was all of no use  The lump only grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as big as his face, and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever losing it, and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the lump on his face all his life  One day the firewood gave out in his kitchen, so, as his wife wanted some at once, the old man took his ax and set out for the woods up among the hills not very far from his home  It was a fine day in the early autumn, and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home  So the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping wood, and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his wife  When the day began to draw to a close, he turned his face homewards  The old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily', " He looked about for some shelter, but there was not even a charcoal-burner's hut near", ' At last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree  The hole was near the ground, so he crept in easily, and sat down in hopes that he had only been overtaken by a mountain shower, and that the weather would soon clear', " But much to the old man's disappointment, instead of clearing the rain fell more and more heavily, and finally a heavy thunderstorm broke over the mountain", ' The thunder roared so terrifically, and the heavens seemed to be so ablaze with lightning, that the old man could hardly believe himself to be alive  He thought that he must die of fright  At last, however, the sky cleared, and the whole country was aglow in the rays of the setting sun', " The old man's spirits revived when he looked out at the beautiful twilight, and he was about to step out from his strange hiding-place in the hollow tree when the sound of what seemed like the approaching steps of several people caught his ear", ' He at once thought that his friends had come to look for him, and he was delighted at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home  But on looking out from the tree, what was his amazement to see, not his friends, but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot  The more he looked, the greater was his astonishment  Some of these demons were as large as giants, others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the rest of their bodies, others again had absurdly long noses, and some had such big mouths that they seemed to open from ear to ear  All had horns growing on their foreheads  The old man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree  Fortunately for him the demons did not see him, as the tree was in the background  So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree  While he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be able to get home, he heard the sounds of gay music, and then some of the demons began to sing  "What are these creatures doing?" said the old man to himself  "I will look out, it sounds very amusing' ,  " After Ball-Carrier had managed to drown the Bad One so that he could not do any more mischief, he forgot the way to his grandmother's house, and could not find it again, though he searched everywhere", ' During this time he wandered into many strange places, and had many adventures; and one day he came to a hut where a young girl lived  He was tired and hungry and begged her to let him in and rest, and he stayed a long while, and the girl became his wife  One morning he saw two children playing in front of the hut, and went out to speak to them  But as soon as they saw him they set up cries of horror and ran away', " 'They are the children of my sister who has been on a long journey,' replied his wife, 'and now that she knows you are my husband she wants to kill you", "' 'Oh, well, let her try,' replied Ball-Carrier", " 'It is not the first time people have wished to do that", " And here I am still, you see!' 'Be careful,' said the wife, 'she is very cunning", "' But at this moment the sister-in-law came up", " 'How do you do, brother-in-law? I have heard of you so often that I am very glad to meet you", ' I am told that you are more powerful than any man on earth, and as I am powerful too, let us try which is the strongest', "' 'That will be delightful,' answered he", " 'Suppose we begin with a short race, and then we will go on to other things", "' 'That will suit me very well,' replied the woman, who was a witch", " 'And let us agree that the one who wins shall have the right to kill the other", "' 'Oh, certainly,' said Ball-Carrier;' and I don't think we shall find a flatter course than the prairie itself--no one knows how many miles it stretches", ' We will run to the end and back again', "' This being settled they both made ready for the race, and Ball-Carrier silently begged the good spirits to help him, and not to let him fall into the hands of this wicked witch", " 'When the sun touches the trunk of that tree we will start,' said she, as they both stood side by side", ' But with the first step Ball-Carrier changed himself into a wolf and for a long way kept ahead  Then gradually he heard her creeping up behind him, and soon she was in front  So Ball-Carrier took the shape of a pigeon and flew rapidly past her, but in a little while she was in front again and the end of the prairie was in sight', " 'A crow can fly faster than a pigeon,' thought he, and as a crow he managed to pass her and held his ground so long that he fancied she was quite beaten", ' The witch began to be afraid of it too, and putting out all her strength slipped past him  Next he put on the shape of a hawk, and in this form he reached the bounds of the prairie, he and the witch turning homewards at the moment  Bird after bird he tried, but every time the witch gained on him and took the lead  At length the goal was in sight, and Ball-Carrier knew that unless he could get ahead now he would be killed before his own door, under the eyes of his wife  His eyes had grown dim from fatigue, his wings flapped wearily and hardly bore him along, while the witch seemed as fresh as ever  What bird was there whose flight was swifter than his? Would not the good spirits tell him? Ah, of course he knew; why had he not thought of it at first and spared himself all that fatigue? And the next instant a humming bird, dressed in green and blue, flashed past the woman and entered the house' ,  " A little back from the high road there stands a house which is called 'Hemgard", "' Perhaps you remember the two beautiful mountain ash trees by the reddish-brown palings, and the high gate, and the garden with the beautiful barberry bushes which are always the first to become grown in spring, and which in summer are weighed down with their beautiful berries", ' Behind the garden there is a hedge with tall aspens which rustle in the morning wind, behind the hedge is a road, behind the road is a wood, and behind the wood the wide world  But on the other side of the garden there is a lake, and beyond the lake is a village, and all around stretch meadows and fields, now yellow, now green', " In the pretty house, which has white window-frames, a neat porch and clean steps, which are always strewn with finely-cut juniper leaves, Walter's parents live", ' His brother Frederick, his sister Lotta, old Lena, Jonah, Caro and Bravo, Putte and Murre, and Kuckeliku  Caro lives in the dog house, Bravo in the stable, Putte with the stableman, Murre a little here and a little there, and Kuckeliku lives in the hen house, that is his kingdom  Walter is six years old, and he must soon begin to go to school  He cannot read yet, but he can do many other things  He can turn cartwheels, stand on his head, ride see-saw, throw snowballs, play ball, crow like a cock, eat bread and butter and drink sour milk, tear his trousers, wear holes in his elbows, break the crockery in pieces, throw balls through the windowpanes, draw old men on important papers, walk over the flower-beds, eat himself sick with gooseberries, and be well after a whipping', " For the rest he has a good heart but a bad memory, and forgets his father's and his mother's admonitions, and so often gets into trouble and meets with adventures, as you shall hear, but first of all I must tell you how brave he was and how he hunted wolves", ' Once in the spring, a little before Midsummer, Walter heard that there were a great many wolves in the wood, and that pleased him', " He was wonderfully brave when he was in the midst of his companions or at home with his brothers and sister, then he used often to say 'One wolf is nothing, there ought to be at least four", "' When he wrestled with Klas Bogenstrom or Frithiof Waderfelt and struck them in the back, he would say 'That is what I shall do to a wolf!' and when he shot arrows at Jonas and they rattled against his sheepskin coat he would say: 'That is how I should shoot you if you were a wolf!' Indeed, some thought that the brave boy boasted a little; but one must indeed believe him since he said so himself", " So Jonas and Lena used to say of him 'Look, there goes Walter, who shoots the wolves", "' And other boys and girls would say 'Look, there goes brave Walter, who is brave enough to fight with four", "' There was no one so fully convinced of this as Walter himself, and one day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt", ' He took with him his drum, which had holes in one end since the time he had climbed up on it to reach a cluster of rowan berries, and his tin sabre, which was a little broken, because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a whole unfriendly army of gooseberry bushes  He did not forget to arm himself quite to the teeth with his pop-gun, his bow, and his air-pistol', " He had a burnt cork in his pocket to blacken his moustache, and a red cock's feather to put in his cap to make himself look fierce", ' He had besides in his trouser pocket a clasp knife with a bone handle, to cut off the ears of the wolves as soon as he had killed them, for he thought it would be cruel to do that while they were still living  It was such a good thing that Jonas was going with corn to the mill, for Walter got a seat on the load, while Caro ran barking beside them  As soon as they came to the wood Walter looked cautiously around him to see perchance there was a wolf in the bushes, and he did not omit to ask Jonas if wolves were afraid of a drum', " 'Of course they are' (that is understood) said Jonas", ' Thereupon Walter began to beat his drum with all his might while they were going through the wood  When they came to the mill Walter immediately asked if there had been any wolves in the neighbourhood lately', " 'Alas! yes,' said the miller, 'last night the wolves have eaten our fattest ram there by the kiln not far from here", "' 'Ah!' said Walter, 'do you think that there were many?' 'We don't know,' answered the miller", " 'Oh, it is all the same,' said Walter", " 'I only asked so that I should know if I should take Jonas with me" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a poor knight who had a great many children, and found it very hard to get enough for them to eat  One day he sent his eldest son, Rosald, a brave and honest youth, to the neighbouring town to do some business, and here Rosald met a young man named Geirald, with whom he made friends  Now Geirald was the son of a rich man, who was proud of the boy, and had all his life allowed him to do whatever he fancied, and, luckily for the father, he was prudent and sensible, and did not waste money, as many other rich young men might have done  For some time he had set his heart on travelling into foreign countries, and after he had been talking for a little while to Rosald, he asked if his new friend would be his companion on his journey', " 'There is nothing I should like better,' answered Rosald, shaking his head sorrowfully; 'but my father is very poor, and he could never give me the money", "' 'Oh, if that is your only difficulty, it is all right,' cried Geirald", " 'My father has more money than he knows what to do with, and he will give me as much as I want for both of us; only, there is one thing you must promise me, Rosald, that, supposing we have any adventures, you will let the honour and glory of them fall to me", "' 'Yes, of course, that is only fair,' answered Rosald, who never cared about putting himself forward", " 'But I cannot go without telling my parents", ' I am sure they will think me lucky to get such a chance', "' As soon as the business was finished, Rosald hastened home", ' His parents were delighted to hear of his good fortune, and his father gave him his own sword, which was growing rusty for want of use, while his mother saw that his leather jerkin was in order', " 'Be sure you keep the promise you made to Geirald,' said she, as she bade him good-bye, 'and, come what may, see that you never betray him", "' Full of joy Rosald rode off, and the next day he and Geirald started off to seek adventures", ' To their disappointment their own land was so well governed that nothing out of the common was very likely to happen, but directly they crossed the border into another kingdom all seemed lawlessness and confusion  They had not gone very far, when, riding across a mountain, they caught a glimpse of several armed men hiding amongst some trees in their path, and remembered suddenly some talk they had heard of a band of twelve robbers who lay in wait for rich travellers  The robbers were more like savage beasts than men, and lived somewhere at the top of the mountain in caves and holes in the ground', " They were all called 'Hankur,' and were distinguished one from another by the name of a colour--blue, grey, red, and so on, except their chief, who was known as Hankur the Tall", ' All this and more rushed into the minds of the two young men as they saw the flash of their swords in the moonlight', " 'It is impossible to fight them--they are twelve to two,' whispered Geirald, stopping his horse in the path", " 'We had much better ride back and take the lower road", ' It would be stupid to throw away our lives like this', "' 'Oh, we can't turn back,' answered Rosald, 'we should be ashamed to look anyone in the face again! And, besides, it is a grand opportunity to show what we are made of", ' Let us tie up our horses here, and climb up the rocks so that we can roll stones down on them', "' 'Well, we might try that, and then we shall always have our horses,' said Geirald", ' So they went up the rocks silently and carefully  The robbers were lying all ready, expecting every moment to see their victims coming round the corner a few yards away, when a shower of huge stones fell on their heads, killing half the band  The others sprang up the rock, but as they reached the top the sword of Rosald swung round, and one man after another rolled down into the valley  At last the chief managed to spring up, and, grasping Rosald by the waist, flung away his sword, and the two fought desperately, their bodies swaying always nearer the edge', " It seemed as if Rosald, being the smaller of the two, MUST fall over, when, with his left hand, he drew the robber's sword out of its sheath and plunged it into his heart" ,  ' Long ago a king and queen ruled over the islands of the west, and they had one son, whom they loved dearly  The boy grew up to be tall and strong and handsome, and he could run and shoot, and swim and dive better than any lad of his own age in the country  Besides, he knew how to sail about, and sing songs to the harp, and during the winter evenings, when everyone was gathered round the huge hall fire shaping bows or weaving cloth, Ian Direach would tell them tales of the deeds of his fathers  So the time slipped by till Ian was almost a man, as they reckoned men in those days, and then his mother the queen died  There was great mourning throughout all the isles, and the boy and his father mourned her bitterly also; but before the new year came the king had married another wife, and seemed to have forgotten his old one  Only Ian remembered  On a morning when the leaves were yellow in the trees of the glen, Ian slung his bow over his shoulder, and filling his quiver with arrows, went on to the hill in search of game  But not a bird was to be seen anywhere, till at length a blue falcon flew past him, and raising his bow he took aim at her', " His eye was straight and his hand steady, but the falcon's flight was swift, and he only shot a feather from her wing", ' As the sun was now low over the sea he put the feather in his game bag, and set out homewards', " 'Have you brought me much game to-day?' asked his stepmother as he entered the hall", " 'Nought save this,' he answered, handing her the feather of the blue falcon, which she held by the tip and gazed at silently", " Then she turned to Ian and said: 'I am setting it on you as crosses and as spells, and as the fall of the year! That you may always be cold, and wet and dirty, and that your shoes may ever have pools in them, till you bring me hither the blue falcon on which that feather grew", "' 'If it is spells you are laying I can lay them too,' answered Ian Direach; 'and you shall stand with one foot on the great house and another on the castle, till I come back again, and your face shall be to the wind, from wheresoever it shall blow", "' Then he went away to seek the bird, as his stepmother bade him; and, looking homewards from the hill, he saw the queen standing with one foot on the great house, and the other on the castle, and her face turned towards whatever tempest should blow", ' On he journeyed, over hills, and through rivers till he reached a wide plain, and never a glimpse did he catch of the falcon  Darker and darker it grew, and the small birds were seeking their nests, and at length Ian Direach could see no more, and he lay down under some bushes and sleep came to him', " And in his dream a soft nose touched him, and a warm body curled up beside him, and a low voice whispered to him: 'Fortune is against you, Ian Direach; I have but the cheek and the hoof of a sheep to give you, and with these you must be content", "' With that Ian Direach awoke, and beheld Gille Mairtean the fox", ' Between them they kindled a fire, and ate their supper  Then Gille Mairtean the fox bade Ian Direach lie down as before, and sleep till morning', " And in the morning, when he awoke, Gille Mairtean said: 'The falcon that you seek is in the keeping of the Giant of the Five Heads, and the Five Necks, and the Five Humps", ' I will show you the way to his house, and I counsel you to do his bidding, nimbly and cheerfully, and, above all, to treat his birds kindly, for in this manner he may give you his falcon to feed and care for  And when this happens, wait till the giant is out of his house; then throw a cloth over the falcon and bear her away with you  Only see that not one of her feathers touches anything within the house, or evil will befall you', "' 'I thank you for your counsel,' spake Ian Direach, 'and I will be careful to follow it", "' Then he took the path to the giant's house", " 'Who is there?' cried the giant, as someone knocked loudly on the door of his house", " 'One who seeks work as a servant,' answered Ian Direach", " 'And what can you do?' asked the giant again" ,  ' Far away in a hot country, where the forests are very thick and dark, and the rivers very swift and strong, there once lived a strange pair of friends  Now one of the friends was a big white rabbit named Isuro, and the other was a tall baboon called Gudu, and so fond were they of each other that they were seldom seen apart  One day, when the sun was hotter even than usual, the rabbit awoke from his midday sleep, and saw Gudu the baboon standing beside him', " 'Get up,' said Gudu; 'I am going courting, and you must come with me", ' So put some food in a bag, and sling it round your neck, for we may not be able to find anything to eat for a long while', "' Then the rabbit rubbed his eyes, and gathered a store of fresh green things from under the bushes, and told Gudu that he was ready for the journey", ' They went on quite happily for some distance, and at last they came to a river with rocks scattered here and there across the stream', " 'We can never jump those wide spaces if we are burdened with food,' said Gudu, 'we must throw it into the river, unless we wish to fall in ourselves", "' And stooping down, unseen by Isuro, who was in front of him, Gudu picked up a big stone, and threw it into the water with a loud splash", " 'It is your turn now,' he cried to Isuro", ' And with a heavy sigh, the rabbit unfastened his bag of food, which fell into the river  The road on the other side led down an avenue of trees, and before they had gone very far Gudu opened the bag that lay hidden in the thick hair about his neck, and began to eat some delicious-looking fruit', " 'Where did you get that from?' asked Isuro enviously", " 'Oh, I found after all that I could get across the rocks quite easily, so it seemed a pity not to keep my bag,' answered Gudu", " 'Well, as you tricked me into throwing away mine, you ought to let me share with you,' said Isuro", ' But Gudu pretended not to hear him, and strode along the path  By-and-bye they entered a wood, and right in front of them was a tree so laden with fruit that its branches swept the ground  And some of the fruit was still green, and some yellow', " The rabbit hopped forward with joy, for he was very hungry; but Gudu said to him: 'Pluck the green fruit, you will find it much the best", ' I will leave it all for you, as you have had no dinner, and take the yellow for myself', "' So the rabbit took one of the green oranges and began to bite it, but its skin was so hard that he could hardly get his teeth through the rind", " 'It does not taste at all nice,' he cried, screwing up his face; 'I would rather have one of the yellow ones", "' 'No! no! I really could not allow that,' answered Gudu", " 'They would only make you ill", ' Be content with the green fruit', "' And as they were all he could get, Isuro was forced to put up with them", ' After this had happened two or three times, Isuro at last had his eyes opened, and made up his mind that, whatever Gudu told him, he would do exactly the opposite', " However, by this time they had reached the village where dwelt Gudu's future wife, and as they entered Gudu pointed to a clump of bushes, and said to Isuro: 'Whenever I am eating, and you hear me call out that my food has burnt me, run as fast as you can and gather some of those leaves that they may heal my mouth", "' The rabbit would have liked to ask him why he ate food that he knew would burn him, only he was afraid, and just nodded in reply; but when they had gone on a little further, he said to Gudu: 'I have dropped my needle; wait here a moment while I go and fetch it", "' 'Be quick then,' answered Gudu, climbing into a tree" ,  ' There was once upon a time a man who understood all sorts of arts; he served in the war, and bore himself bravely and well; but when the war was over, he got his discharge, and set out on his travels with three farthings of his pay in his pocket', " 'Wait,' he said; 'that does not please me; only let me find the right people, and the King shall yet give me all the treasures of his kingdom", "' He strode angrily into the forest, and there he saw a man standing who had uprooted six trees as if they were straws", " He said to him, 'Will you be my servant and travel with me?' 'Yes,' he answered; 'but first of all I will take this little bundle of sticks home to my mother,' and he took one of the trees and wound it round the other five, raised the bundle on his shoulders and bore it off", " Then he came back and went with his master, who said, 'We two ought to be able to travel through the wide world!' And when they had gone a little way they came upon a hunter, who was on his knees, his gun on his shoulder, aiming at something", " The master said to him, 'Hunter, what are you aiming at?' He answered, 'Two miles from this place sits a fly on a branch of an oak; I want to shoot out its left eye", "' 'Oh, go with me,' said the man; 'if we three are together we shall easily travel through the wide world", "' The hunter agreed and went with him, and they came to seven windmills whose sails were going round quite fast, and yet there was not a breath of wind, nor was a leaf moving", " The man said, 'I don't know what is turning those windmills; there is not the slightest breeze blowing", "' So he walked on with his servants, and when they had gone two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree, holding one of his nostrils and blowing out of the other", " 'Fellow, what are you puffing at up there?' asked the man", " He replied, 'Two miles from this place are standing seven windmills; see, I am blowing to drive them round", "' 'Oh, go with me,' said the man; 'if we four are together we shall easily travel through the wide world", "' So the blower got down and went with him, and after a time they saw a man who was standing on one leg, and had unstrapped the other and laid it near him", " Then said the master, 'You have made yourself very comfortable to rest!' 'I am a runner,' answered he; 'and so that I shall not go too quickly, I have unstrapped one leg; when I run with two legs, I go faster than a bird flies", "' 'Oh, go with me; if we five are together, we shall easily travel through the wide world", "' So he went with him, and, not long afterwards, they met a man who wore a little hat, but he had it slouched over one ear", " 'Manners, manners!' said the master to him; 'don't hang your hat over one ear; you look like a madman!' 'I dare not,' said the other, 'for if I were to put my hat on straight, there would come such a frost that the very birds in the sky would freeze and fall dead on the earth", "' 'Oh, go with me,' said the master; 'if we six are together, we shall easily travel through the wide world", ' Now the Six came to a town in which the King had proclaimed that whoever should run with his daughter in a race, and win, should become her husband; but if he lost, he must lose his head', " This was reported to the man who declared he would compete, 'but,' he said, 'I shall let my servant run for me", "' The King replied, 'Then both your heads must be staked, and your head and his must be guaranteed for the winner", "' When this was agreed upon and settled, the man strapped on the runner's other leg, saying to him, 'Now be nimble, and see that we win!' It was arranged that whoever should first bring water out of a stream a long way off, should be the victor", " Then the runner got a pitcher, and the King's daughter another, and they began to run at the same time; but in a moment, when the King's daughter was only just a little way off, no spectator could see the runner, and it seemed as if the wind had whistled past", ' In a short time he reached the stream, filled his pitcher with water, and turned round again  But, half way home, a great drowsiness came over him; he put down his pitcher, lay down, and fell asleep', " He had, however, put a horse's skull which was lying on the ground, for his pillow, so that he should not be too comfortable and might soon wake up", " In the meantime the King's daughter, who could also run well, as well as an ordinary man could, reached the stream, and hastened back with her pitcher full of water", " When she saw the runner lying there asleep, she was delighted, and said, 'My enemy is given into my hands!' She emptied his pitcher and ran on", ' Everything now would have been lost, if by good luck the hunter had not been standing on the castle tower and had seen everything with his sharp eyes  Once upon a time there lived a miller who was so rich that, when he was going to be married, he asked to the feast not only his own friends but also the wild animals who dwelt in the hills and woods round about  The chief of the bears, the wolves, the foxes, the horses, the cows, the goats, the sheep, and the reindeer, all received invitations; and as they were not accustomed to weddings they were greatly pleased and flattered, and sent back messages in the politest language that they would certainly be there  The first to start on the morning of the wedding-day was the bear, who always liked to be punctual; and, besides, he had a long way to go, and his hair, being so thick and rough, needed a good brushing before it was fit to be seen at a party  However, he took care to awaken very early, and set off down the road with a light heart  Before he had walked very far he met a boy who came whistling along, hitting at the tops of the flowers with a stick', " 'Where are you going?' said he, looking at the bear in surprise, for he was an old acquaintance, and not generally so smart", " 'Oh, just to the miller's marriage,' answered the bear carelessly", " 'Of course, I would much rather stay at home, but the miller was so anxious I should be there that I really could not refuse", "' 'Don't go, don't go!' cried the boy", " 'If you do you will never come back! You have got the most beautiful skin in the world--just the kind that everyone is wanting, and they will be sure to kill you and strip you of it", "' 'I had not thought of that,' said the bear, whose face turned white, only nobody could see it", " 'If you are certain that they would be so wicked--but perhaps you are jealous because nobody has invited you?' 'Oh, nonsense!' replied the boy angrily, 'do as you see", " It is your skin, and not mine; I don't care what becomes of it!' And he walked quickly on with his head in the air", " The bear waited until he was out of sight, and then followed him slowly, for he felt in his heart that the boy's advice was good, though he was too proud to say so", ' The boy soon grew tired of walking along the road, and turned off into the woods, where there were bushes he could jump and streams he could wade; but he had not gone far before he met the wolf', " 'Where are you going?' asked he, for it was not the first time he had seen him", " 'Oh, just to the miller's marriage,' answered the wolf, as the bear had done before him", " 'It is rather tiresome, of course--weddings are always so stupid; but still one must be good-natured!'

'Yes,' answered the fox; 'it is a long journey to take for such a thing as that, but you know what the miller's friends are like--so dull and heavy! It is only kind to go and amuse them a little", "' 'You poor fellow,' said the boy pityingly", " 'Take my advice and stay at home" ,  ' One day Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to dine with their uncle and aunts Thunder and Lightning', " Their mother (one of the most distant Stars you see far up in the sky) waited alone for her children's return", ' Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish  They enjoyed the great feast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving any of it to take home to their mother--but the gentle Moon did not forget her  Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a small portion under one of her beautiful long finger-nails, that Star might also have a share in the treat  On their return, their mother, who had kept watch for them all night long with her little bright eye, said, "Well, children, what have you brought home for me?" Then Sun (who was eldest) said, "I have brought nothing home for you  I went out to enjoy myself with my friends--not to fetch a dinner for my mother!" And Wind said, "Neither have I brought anything home for you, mother  You could hardly expect me to bring a collection of good things for you, when I merely went out for my own pleasure " But Moon said, "Mother, fetch a plate, see what I have brought you " And shaking her hands she showered down such a choice dinner as never was seen before  Then Star turned to Sun and spoke thus, "Because you went out to amuse yourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, without any thought of your mother at home--you shall be cursed  Henceforth, your rays shall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that they touch  And men shall hate you, and cover their heads when you appear " (And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day ) Then she turned to Wind and said, "You also who forgot your mother in the midst of your selfish pleasures--hear your doom  You shall always blow in the hot dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all living things  And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time " (And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable ) But to Moon she said, "Daughter, because you remembered your mother, and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth you shall be ever cool, and calm, and bright', " No noxious glare shall accompany your pure rays, and men shall always call you 'blessed", '\'"     Once upon a time there lived a man who had only one son, a lazy, stupid boy, who would never do anything he was told  When the father was dying, he sent for his son and told him that he would soon be left alone in the world, with no possessions but the small cottage they lived in and a pear tree which grew behind it, and that, whether he liked it or not, he would have to work, or else he would starve  Then the old man died  But the boy did not work; instead, he idled about as before, contenting himself with eating the pears off his tree, which, unlike other pear trees before or since, bore fruit the whole year round  Indeed, the pears were so much finer than any you could get even in the autumn, that one day, in the middle of the winter, they attracted the notice of a fox who was creeping by', " 'Dear me; what lovely pears!' he said to the youth", " 'Do give me a basket of them", " It will bring you luck!' 'Ah, little fox, but if I give you a basketful, what am I to eat?' asked the boy", " 'Oh, trust me, and do what I tell you,' said the fox; 'I know it will bring you luck", "' So the boy got up and picked some of the ripest pears and put them into a rush basket", " The fox thanked him, and, taking the basket in his mouth, trotted off to the king's palace and made his way straight to the king", " 'Your Majesty, my master sends you a few of his best pears, and begs you will graciously accept them,' he said, laying the basket at the feet of the king", " 'Pears! at this season?' cried the king, peering down to look at them; 'and, pray, who is your master?' 'The Count Piro,' answered the fox", " 'But how does he manage to get pears in midwinter?' asked the king", " 'Oh, he has everything he wants,' replied the fox; 'he is richer even than you are, your Majesty", "' 'Then what can I send him in return for his pears?' said the king", " 'Nothing, your Majesty, or you would hurt his feelings,' answered the fox", " 'Well, tell him how heartily I thank him, and how much I shall enjoy them", "' And the fox went away", ' He trotted back to the cottage with his empty basket and told his tale, but the youth did not seem as pleased to hear as the fox was to tell', " 'But, my dear little fox,' said he, 'you have brought me nothing in return, and I am so hungry!' 'Let me alone,' replied the fox; 'I know what I am doing", ' You will see, it will bring you luck', "' A few days after this the fox came back again", " 'I must have another basket of pears,' said he", " 'Ah, little fox, what shall I eat if you take away all my pears?' answered the youth", " 'Be quiet, it will be all right,' said the fox; and taking a bigger basket than before, he filled it quite full of pears", ' Then he picked it up in his mouth, and trotted off to the palace', " 'Your Majesty, as you seemed to like the first basket of pears, I have brought you some more,' said he, 'with my master, the Count Piro's humble respects", "' 'Now, surely it is not possible to grow such pears with deep snow on the ground?' cried the king", " 'Oh, that never affects them,' answered the fox lightly; 'he is rich enough to do anything" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not get on at all well together, for the younger was much handsomer than his elder brother who was very jealous of him  When they grew older, things became worse and worse, and at last one day as they were walking through a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other, tied him to a tree, and went on his way hoping that the boy might starve to death', " However, it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed the tree with his flock, and seeing the prisoner, he stopped and said to him, 'Tell me, my son why are you tied to that tree?'

After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse, but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise", ' But when the same thing happened the third time, the dragon lost his temper, and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating  This offended the horse and made him angry, and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head, he made no further fuss, but suffered himself to be led quietly away', " Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off, calling over his shoulder, 'Hi! dragon! dragon! if anyone asks you what has become of your horse, you can say that I have got him!' But the king said, 'The flying horse is all very well, but I want something more", ' You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on the bed of the dragon, or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces', "' 'Is that all?' answered the youth", " 'That is easily done", "' And when night came he went away to the dragon's house and climbed up on to the roof", ' Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung, and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up', " But the little bells all began to ring, and the dragon woke and said to his wife, 'Wife, you have pulled off all the bed-clothes!' and drew the covering towards him, pulling, as he did so, the young man into the room", " Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot, 'To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him, and when I get back we will eat him together", "' So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him", ' But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him, the prisoner caught her by the legs, threw her to the ground, seized her and speedily cut her throat, just as she had been about to do for him, and put her body in the oven  Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king  The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow  Long ago there lived a very rich man who had three sons  When he felt himself to be dying he divided his property between them, making them share alike, both in money and lands  Soon after he died the king set forth a proclamation through the whole country that whoever could build a ship that should float both on land and sea should have his daughter to wife', " The eldest brother, when he heard it, said to the other, 'I think I will spend some of my money in trying to build that ship, as I should like to have the king for my father-in-law", "' So he called together all the shipbuilders in the land, and gave them orders to begin the ship without delay", ' And trees were cut down, and great preparations made, and in a few days everybody knew what it was all for; and there was a crowd of old people pressing round the gates of the yard, where the young man spent the most of his day', " 'Ah, master, give us work,' they said, 'so that we may earn our bread", "' But he only gave them hard words, and spoke roughly to them", " 'You are old, and have lost your strength; of what use are you?'

Get you gone!\' And if any presented themselves that were not skilled workmen he would have none of them', " At last there knocked at the gate a little old man with a long white beard, and said, 'Will you give me work, so that I may earn my bread?' But he was only driven away like the rest", " The ship took a long while to build, and cost a great deal of money, and when it was launched a sudden squall rose, and it fell to pieces, and with it all the young man's hopes of winning the princess", ' By this time he had not a penny left, so he went back to his two brothers and told his tale', " And the second brother said to himself as he listened, 'Certainly he has managed very badly, but I should like to see if I can't do better, and win the princess for my own self", "' So he called together all the shipbuilders throughout the country, and gave them orders to build a ship which should float on the land as well as on the sea", " But his heart was no softer than his brother's, and every man that was not a skilled workman was chased away with hard words", ' Last came the white-bearded man, but he fared no better than the rest  When the ship was finished the launch took place, and everything seemed going smoothly when a gale sprang up, and the vessel was dashed to pieces on the rocks  The young man had spent his whole fortune on it, and now it was all swallowed up, was forced to beg shelter from his youngest brother', " When he told his story the youngest said to himself, 'I am not rich enough to support us all three", ' I had better take my turn, and if I manage to win the princess there will be her fortune as well as my own for us to live on', "' So he called together all the shipbuilders in the kingdom, and gave orders that a new ship should be built", " Then all the old people came and asked for work, and he answered cheerfully, 'Oh, yes, there is plenty for everybody;' and when the boys begged to be allowed to help he found something that they could do", " And when the old man with the long white beard stood before him, praying that he might earn his bread, he replied, 'Oh, father, I could not suffer you to work, but you shall be overseer, and look after the rest", "' Now the old man was a holy hermit, and when he saw how kind-hearted the youth was he determined to do all he could for him to gain the wish of his heart", " By-and-bye, when the ship was finished, the hermit said to his young friend, 'Now you can go and claim the king's daughter, for hte ship will float both by land and sea", "' 'Oh, good father,' cried the young man, 'you will not forsake me? Stay with me, I pray you, and lead me to the king!' 'If you wish it, I will,' said the hermit, 'on condition that you will give me half of anything you get", "' 'Oh, if that is all,' answered he, 'it is easily promised!' And they set out together on the ship", ' After they had gone some distance they saw a man standing in a thick fog, which he was trying to put into a sack', " 'Oh, good father,' exclaimed the youth, 'what can he be doing?' 'Ask him,' said the old man" ,  ' In a small hut, right in the middle of the forest, lived a man, his wife, three sons and a daughter  For some reason, all the animals seemed to have left that part of the country, and food grew very scarce; so, one morning, after a night of snow, when the tracks of beasts might be easily seen, the three boys started off to hunt  They kept together for some time, till they reached a place where the path they had been following split into two, and one of the brothers called his dog and went to the left, while the others took the trail to the right  These had not gone far when their dogs scented a bear, and drove him out from the thicket  The bear ran across a clearing, and the elder brother managed to place an arrow right in his head  They both took up the bear, and carried it towards home, meeting the third at the spot where they had parted from him', " When they reached home they threw the bear down on the floor of the hut saying, 'Father, here is a bear which we killed; now we can have some dinner", "' But the father, who was in a bad temper, only said: 'When I was a young man we used to get two bears in one day", "' The sons were rather disappointed at hearing this, and though there was plenty of meat to last for two or three days, they started off early in the morning down the same trail that they had followed before", ' As they drew near the fork a bear suddenly ran out from behind a tree, and took the path on the right  The two elder boys and their dogs pursued him, and soon the second son, who was also a good shot, killed him instantly with an arrow  At the fork of the trail, on their way home, they met the youngest, who had taken the left-hand road, and had shot a bear for himself', " But when they threw the two bears triumphantly on the floor of the hut their father hardly looked at them, and only said: 'When I was a young man I used to get three bears in one day", "' The next day they were luckier than before, and brought back three bears, on which their father told them that HE had always killed four", ' However, that did not prevent him from skinning the bears and cooking them in a way of his own, which he thought very good, and they all ate an excellent supper  Now these bears were the servants of the great bear chief who lived in a high mountain a long way off  And every time a bear was killed his shadow returned to the house of the bear chief, with the marks of his wounds plainly to bee seen by the rest  The chief was furious at the number of bears the hunters had killed, and determined that he would find some way of destroying them', " So he called another of his servants, and said to him: 'Go to the thicket near the fork, where the boys killed your brothers, and directly they or the dogs see you return here as fast as ever you can", ' The mountain will open to let you in, and the hunters will follow you  Then I shall have them in my power, and be able to revenge myself', "' The servant bowed low, and started at once for the fork, where he hid himself in the bushes", ' By-and-by the boys came in sight, but this time there were only two of them, as the youngest had stayed at home', " The air was warm and damp, and the snow soft and slushy, and the elder brother's bowstring hung loose, while the bow of the younger caught in a tree and snapped in half", ' At that moment the dogs began to bark loudly, and the bear rushed out of the thicket and set off in the direction of the mountain  Without thinking that they had nothing to defend themselves with, should the bear turn and attack them, the boys gave chase  The bear, who knew quite well that he could not be shot, sometimes slackened his pace and let the dogs get quite close; and in this way the elder son reached the mountain without observing it, while his brother, who had hurt his foot, was still far behind  As he ran up, the mountain opened to admit the bear, and the boy, who was close on his heels, rushed in after him, and did not know where he was till he saw bears sitting on every side of him, holding a council  The animal he had been chasing sank panting in their midst, and the boy, very much frightened, stood still, letting his bow fall to the ground', " 'Why are you trying to kill all my servants?' asked the chief" ,  ' In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt  One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, "You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side " This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess  The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side  When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it  The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky  All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot  When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, "Don\'t fly away and leave me alone when the Raja\'s son shoots  If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam " Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering  The prince was greatly surprised, and said, "Why, these birds can talk!" Then he said to the parrots, "Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?" But the parrots would not tell him where she lived  "You can never get to the Princess Labam\'s country " That is all they would say  The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home  When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill  At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam  "I must go," he said; "I must see what she is like  Tell me where her country is " "We do not know where it is," answered his father and mother  "Then I must go and look for it," said the prince  "No, no," they said, "you must not leave us  You are our only son  Stay with us  You will never find the Princess Labam " "I must try and find her," said the prince  "Perhaps God will show me the way  If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again  Still I must go " So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him  His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse' ,  " 'Mother, I have seen such a wonderful man,' said a little boy one day, as he entered a hut in Lapland, bearing in his arms the bundle of sticks he had been sent out to gather", " 'Have you, my son; and what was he like?' asked the mother, as she took off the child's sheepskin coat and shook it on the doorstep", " 'Well, I was tired of stooping for the sticks, and was leaning against a tree to rest, when I heard a noise of 'sh-'sh, among the dead leaves", ' I thought perhaps it was a wolf, so I stood very still  But soon there came past a tall man--oh! twice as tall as father--with a long red beard and a red tunic fastened with a silver girdle, from which hung a silver-handled knife  Behind him followed a great dog, which looked stronger than any wolf, or even a bear', " But why are you so pale, mother?' 'It was the Stalo,' replied she, her voice trembling; 'Stalo the man-eater! You did well to hide, or you might never had come back", ' But, remember that, though he is so tall and strong, he is very stupid, and many a Lapp has escaped from his clutches by playing him some clever trick', "' Not long after the mother and son had held this talk, it began to be whispered in the forest that the children of an old man called Patto had vanished one by one, no one knew whither", ' The unhappy father searched the country for miles round without being able to find as much as a shoe or a handkerchief, to show him where they had passed, but at length a little boy came with news that he had seen the Stalo hiding behind a well, near which the children used to play  The boy had waited behind a clump of bushes to see what would happen, and by-and-by he noticed that the Stalo had laid a cunning trap in the path to the well, and that anybody who fell over it would roll into the water and drown there', " And, as he watched, Patto's youngest daughter ran gaily down the path, till her foot caught in the strings that were stretched across the steepest place", ' She slipped and fell, and in another instant had rolled into the water within reach of the Stalo  As soon as Patto heard this tale his heart was filled with rage, and he vowed to have his revenge  So he straightway took an old fur coat from the hook where it hung, and putting it on went out into the forest  When he reached the path that led to the well he looked hastily round to be sure that no one was watching him, then laid himself down as if he had been caught in the snare and had rolled into the well, though he took care to keep his head out of the water', " Very soon he heard a 'sh-'sh of the leaves, and there was the Stalo pushing his way through the undergrowth to see what chance he had of a dinner", " At the first glimpse of Patto's head in the well he laughed loudly, crying: 'Ha! ha! This time it is the old ass! I wonder how he will taste?' And drawing Patto out of the well, he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home", " Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast, while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut, which he meant to hold Patto's flesh when it was cooked", ' In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe; but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors, and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool  The young man looked everywhere, but he could not find the axe, for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes', " 'Stupid fellow! what is the use of you?' grumbled his father angrily; and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool, but they had no better success than their brother", " 'I must come myself, I suppose!' said Stalo, putting aside the box", " But, meanwhile, Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door, so that, as Stalo stepped in, his prisoner raised the axe, and with one blow the ogre's head was rolling on the ground", ' His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away  And in this manner Patto avenged his dead children  But though Stalo was dead, his three sons were still living, and not very far off either', " They had gone to their mother, who was tending some reindeer on the pastures, and told her that by some magic, they knew not what, their father's head had rolled from his body, and they had been so afraid that something dreadful would happen to them that they had come to take refuge with her", ' The ogress said nothing', " Long ago she had found out how stupid her sons were, so she just sent them out to milk the reindeer, while she returned to the other house to bury her husband's body" ,  ' A very wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death, sent for his sons and divided his property among them  However, he did not die for several years afterwards; and miserable years many of them were  Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bear with much abuse and cruelty from his sons  Wretched, selfish ingrates! Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father, hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received their patrimony, they cared not how soon he left them--nay, the sooner the better, because he was only a needless trouble and expense  And they let the poor old man know what they felt  One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles  The friend sympathised very much with him, and promised to think over the matter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do  He did so; in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel before him  "Look here, friend," said he  "Your sons will get to know of my coming here to-day, and will inquire about it  You must pretend that I came to discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are several thousands of rupees richer than you thought you were  Keep these bags in your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as long as you are alive  You will soon find them change their conduct towards you  Salaam  I will come again soon to see how you are getting on " When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth they began to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than ever before', " And thus they continued to the day of the old man's demise, when the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stones and gravel!   " ,  ' The hunters had hunted the wood for so many years that no wild animal was any more to be found in it  You might walk from one end to the other without ever seeing a hare, or a deer, or a boar, or hearing the cooing of the doves in their nest  If they were not dead, they had flown elsewhere  Only three creatures remained alive, and they had hidden themselves in the thickest part of the forest, high up the mountain  These were a grey-furred, long-tailed tanuki, his wife the fox, who was one of his own family, and their little son  The fox and the tanuki were very clever, prudent beasts, and they also were skilled in magic, and by this means had escaped the fate of their unfortunate friends  If they heard the twang of an arrow or saw the glitter of a spear, ever so far off, they lay very still, and were not to be tempted from their hiding-place, if their hunger was ever so great, or the game ever so delicious', " 'We are not so foolish as to risk our lives,' they said to each other proudly", ' But at length there came a day when, in spite of their prudence, they seemed likely to die of starvation, for no more food was to be had  Something had to be done, but they did not know what  Suddenly a bright thought struck the tanuki', " 'I have got a plan,' he cried joyfully to his wife", " 'I will pretend to be dead, and you must change yourself into a man, and take me to the village for sale", " It will be easy to find a buyer, tanukis' skins are always wanted; then buy some food with the money and come home again", ' I will manage to escape somehow, so do not worry about me', "' The fox laughed with delight, and rubbed her paws together with satisfaction", " 'Well, next time I will go,' she said, 'and you can sell me", "' And then she changed herself into a man, and picking up the stiff body of the tanuki, set off towards the village", ' She found him rather heavy, but it would never have done to let him walk through the wood and risk his being seen by somebody  As the tanaki had foretold, buyers were many, and the fox handed him over to the person who offered the largest price, and hurried to get some food with the money  The buyer took the tanuki back to his house, and throwing him into a corner went out  Directly the tanaki found he was alone, he crept cautiously through a chink of the window, thinking, as he did so, how lucky it was that he was not a fox, and was able to climb  Once outside, he hid himself in a ditch till it grew dusk, and then galloped away into the forest  While the food lasted they were all three as happy as kings; but there soon arrived a day when the larder was as empty as ever', " 'It is my turn now to pretend to be dead,' cried the fox", " So the tanuki changed himself into a peasant, and started for the village, with his wife's body hanging over his shoulder", " A buyer was not long in coming forward, and while they were making the bargain a wicked thought darted into the tanuki's head, that if he got rid of the fox there would be more food for him and his son", ' So as he put the money in his pocket he whispered softly to the buyer that the fox was not really dead, and that if he did not take care she might run away from him  The man did not need twice telling  He gave the poor fox a blow on the head, which put an end to her, and the wicked tanuki went smiling to the nearest shop  Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who longed to have a son  As none came, one day they made a vow at the shrine of St  James that if their prayers were granted the boy should set out on a pilgrimage as soon as he had passed his eighteenth birthday  And fancy their delight when one evening the king returned home from hunting and saw a baby lying in the cradle  All the people came crowding round to peep at it, and declared it was the most beautiful baby that ever was seen  Of course that is what they always say, but this time it happened to be true  And every day the boy grew bigger and stronger till he was twelve years old, when the king died, and he was left alone to take care of his mother  In this way six years passed by, and his eighteenth birthday drew near', " When she thought of this the queen's heart sank within her, for he was the light of her eyes' and how was she to send him forth to the unknown dangers that beset a pilgrim? So day by day she grew more and more sorrowful, and when she was alone wept bitterly", " Now the queen imagined that no one but herself knew how sad she was, but one morning her son said to her, 'Mother, why do you cry the whole day long?' 'Nothing, nothing, my son; there is only one thing in the world that troubles me", "' 'What is that one thing?' asked he", " 'Are you afraid your property is badly managed? Let me go and look into the matter", "' This pleased the queen, and he rode off to the plain country, where his mother owned great estates; but everything was in beautiful order, and he returned with a joyful heart, and said, 'Now, mother, you can be happy again, for your lands are better managed than anyone else's I have seen", ' The cattle are thriving; the fields are thick with corn, and soon they will be ripe for harvest', "' 'That is good news indeed,' answered she; but it did not seem to make any difference to her, and the next morning she was weeping and wailing as loudly as ever", " 'Dear mother,' said her son in despair, 'if you will not tell me what is the cause of all this misery I shall leave home and wander far through the world", "' 'Ah, my son, my son,' cried the queen, 'it is the thought that I must part from you which causes me such grief; for before you were born we vowed a vow to St", ' James that when your eighteenth birthday was passed you should make a pilgrimage to his shrine, and very soon you will be eighteen, and I shall lose you  And for a whole year my eyes will never be gladdened by the sight of you, for the shrine is far away', "' 'Will it take no longer than that to reach it?' said he", " 'Oh, don't be so wretched; it is only dead people who never return", ' As long as I am alive you may be sure I will come back to you', "' After this manner he comforted his mother, and on his eighteenth birthday his best horse was led to the door of the palace, and he took leave of the queen in these words, 'Dear mother, farewell, and by the help of fate I shall return to you as soon as I can", "' The queen burst into tears and wept sore; then amidst her sobs she drew three apples from her pocket and held them out, saying, 'My son, take these apples and give heed unto my words", ' You will need a companion in the long journey on which you are going  If you come across a young man who pleases you beg him to accompany you, and when you get to an inn invite him to have dinner with you  After you have eaten cut one of these apples in two unequal parts, and ask him to take one  If he takes the larger bit, then part from him, for he is no true friend to you  But if he takes the smaller bit treat him as your brother, and share with him all you have', "' Then she kissed her son once more, and blessed him, and let him go" ,  ' There was once upon a time a Prince who wanted to marry a Princess, but she must be a true Princess  So he travelled through the whole world to find one, but there was always something against each  There were plenty of Princesses, but he could not find out if they were true Princesses  In every case there was some little defect, which showed the genuine article was not yet found  So he came home again in very low spirits, for he had wanted very much to have a true Princess  One night there was a dreadful storm; it thundered and lightened and the rain streamed down in torrents  It was fearful! There was a knocking heard at the Palace gate, and the old King went to open it  There stood a Princess outside the gate; but oh, in what a sad plight she was from the rain and the storm! The water was running down from her hair and her dress into the points of her shoes and out at the heels again', " And yet she said she was a true Princess! 'Well, we shall soon find that!' thought the old Queen", ' But she said nothing, and went into the sleeping-room, took off all the bed-clothes, and laid a pea on the bottom of the bed  Then she put twenty mattresses on top of the pea, and twenty eider-down quilts on the top of the mattresses  And this was the bed in which the Princess was to sleep  The next morning she was asked how she had slept', " 'Oh, very badly!' said the Princess", " 'I scarcely closed my eyes all night! I am sure I don't know what was in the bed", ' I laid on something so hard that my whole body is black and blue', " It is dreadful!' Now they perceived that she was a true Princess, because she had felt the pea through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down quilts", ' No one but a true Princess could be so sensitive  So the Prince married her, for now he knew that at last he had got hold of a true Princess  And the pea was put into the Royal Museum, where it is still to be seen if no one has stolen it  Now this is a true story    There was once upon a time two farmers, and their names were Hudden and Dudden  They had poultry in their yards, sheep on the uplands, and scores of cattle in the meadow-land alongside the river', " But for all that they weren't happy", " For just between their two farms there lived a poor man by the name of Donald O'Neary", ' He had a hovel over his head and a strip of grass that was barely enough to keep his one cow, Daisy, from starving, and, though she did her best, it was but seldom that Donald got a drink of milk or a roll of butter from Daisy', " You would think there was little here to make Hudden and Dudden jealous, but so it is, the more one has the more one wants, and Donald's neighbours lay awake of nights scheming how they might get hold of his little strip of grass-land", ' Daisy, poor thing, they never thought of; she was just a bag of bones  One day Hudden met Dudden, and they were soon grumbling as usual, and all to the tune of "If only we could get that vagabond Donald O\'Neary out of the country " "Let\'s kill Daisy," said Hudden at last; "if that doesn\'t make him clear out, nothing will " No sooner said than agreed, and it wasn\'t dark before Hudden and Dudden crept up to the little shed where lay poor Daisy trying her best to chew the cud, though she hadn\'t had as much grass in the day as would cover your hand  And when Donald came to see if Daisy was all snug for the night, the poor beast had only time to lick his hand once before she died', " Well, Donald was a shrewd fellow, and downhearted though he was, began to think if he could get any good out of Daisy's death", " He thought and he thought, and the next day you could have seen him trudging off early to the fair, Daisy's hide over his shoulder, every penny he had jingling in his pockets", ' Just before he got to the fair, he made several slits in the hide, put a penny in each slit, walked into the best inn of the town as bold as if it belonged to him, and, hanging the hide up to a nail in the wall, sat down  "Some of your best whisky," says he to the landlord', " But the landlord didn't like his looks", ' "Is it fearing I won\'t pay you, you are?" says Donald; "why I have a hide here that gives me all the money I want " And with that he hit it a whack with his stick and out hopped a penny  The landlord opened his eyes, as you may fancy  "What\'ll you take for that hide?" "It\'s not for sale, my good man " "Will you take a gold piece?" "It\'s not for sale, I tell you  Hasn\'t it kept me and mine for years?" and with that Donald hit the hide another whack and out jumped a second penny  Well, the long and the short of it was that Donald let the hide go, and, that very evening, who but he should walk up to Hudden\'s door? "Good-evening, Hudden  Will you lend me your best pair of scales?" Hudden stared and Hudden scratched his head, but he lent the scales  When Donald was safe at home, he pulled out his pocketful of bright gold and began to weigh each piece in the scales  But Hudden had put a lump of butter at the bottom, and so the last piece of gold stuck fast to the scales when he took them back to Hudden', " If Hudden had stared before, he stared ten times more now, and no sooner was Donald's back turned, than he was of as hard as he could pelt to Dudden's", ' "Good-evening, Dudden  That vagabond, bad luck to him--" "You mean Donald O\'Neary?" "And who else should I mean? He\'s back here weighing out sackfuls of gold " "How do you know that?" "Here are my scales that he borrowed, and here\'s a gold piece still sticking to them  There dwelt a knight in Grianaig of the land of the West, who had three daughters, and for goodness and beauty they had not their like in all the isles  All the people loved them, and loud was the weeping when one day, as the three maidens sat on the rocks on the edge of the sea, dipping their feet in the water, there arose a great beast from under the waves and swept them away beneath the ocean  And none knew whither they had gone, or how to seek them  Now there lived in a town a few miles off a soldier who had three sons, fine youths and strong, and the best players at shinny in that country', " At Christmastide that year, when families met together and great feasts were held, Ian, the youngest of the three brothers, said: 'Let us have a match at shinny on the lawn of the knight of Grianaig, for his lawn is wider and the grass smoother than ours", "' But the others answered: 'Nay, for he is in sorrow, and he will think of the games that we have played there when his daughters looked on", "' 'Let him be pleased or angry as he will,' said Ian; 'we will drive our ball on his lawn to-day", "' And so it was done, and Ian won three games from his brothers", ' But the knight looked out of his window, and was wroth; and bade his men bring the youths before him', " When he stood in his hall and beheld them, his heart was softened somewhat; but his face was angry as he asked: 'Why did you choose to play shinny in front of my castle when you knew full well that the remembrance of my daughters would come back to me? The pain which you have made me suffer you shall suffer also", "' 'Since we have done you wrong,' answered Ian, the youngest, 'build us a ship, and we will go and seek your daughters", ' Let them be to windward, or to leeward, or under the four brown boundaries of the sea, we will find them before a year and a day goes by, and will carry them back to Grianaig', "' In seven days the ship was built, and great store of food and wine placed in her", ' And the three brothers put her head to the sea and sailed away, and in seven days the ship ran herself on to a beach of white sand, and they all went ashore  They had none of them ever seen that land before, and looked about them  Then they saw that, a short way from them, a number of men were working on a rock, with one man standing over them', " 'What place is this?' asked the eldest brother", " And the man who was standing by made answer: 'This is the place where dwell the three daughters of the knight of Grianaig, who are to be wedded to-morrow to three giants", "' 'How can we find them?' asked the young man again", " And the overlooker answered: 'To reach the daughters of the knight of Grianaig you must get into this basket, and be drawn by a rope up the face of this rock", "' 'Oh, that is easily done,' said the eldest brother, jumping into the basket, which at once began to move--up, and up, and up--till he had gone about half-way, when a fat black raven flew at him and pecked him till he was nearly blind, so that he was forced to go back the way he had come", ' After that the second brother got into the creel; but he fared no better, for the raven flew upon him, and he returned as his brother had done', " 'Now it is my turn,' said Ian", ' But when he was halfway up the raven set upon him also', " 'Quick! quick!' cried Ian to the men who held the rope", " 'Quick! quick! or I shall be blinded!' And the men pulled with all their might, and in another moment Ian was on top, and the raven behind him", " 'Will you give me a piece of tobacco?' asked the raven, who was now quite quiet", " 'You rascal! Am I to give you tobacco for trying to peck my eyes out?' answered Ian", " 'That was part of my duty,' replied the raven; 'but give it to me, and I will prove a good friend to you", "' So Ian broke off a piece of tobacco and gave it to him" ,  ' There was once a man who had three daughters, and they were all married to trolls, who lived underground  One day the man thought that he would pay them a visit, and his wife gave him some dry bread to eat by the way  After he had walked some distance he grew both tired and hungry, so he sat down on the east side of a mound and began to eat his dry bread', " The mound then opened, and his youngest daughter came out of it, and said, 'Why, father! why are you not coming in to see me?' 'Oh,' said he, 'if I had known that you lived here, and had seen any entrance, I would have come in", "' Then he entered the mound along with her", ' The troll came home soon after this, and his wife told him that her father was come, and asked him to go and buy some beef to make broth with', " 'We can get it easier than that!' said the troll", ' He fixed an iron spike into one of the beams of the roof, and ran his head against this till he had knocked several large pieces off his head  He was just as well as ever after doing this, and they got their broth without further trouble  The troll then gave the old man a sackful of money, and laden with this he betook himself homewards  When he came near his home he remembered that he had a cow about to calve, so he laid down the money on the ground, ran home as fast as he could, and asked his wife whether the cow had calved yet', " 'What kind of a hurry is this to come home in?' said she", " 'No, the cow has not calved yet", "' 'Then you must come out and help me in with a sackful of money,' said the man", " 'A sackful of money?' cried his wife", " 'Yes, a sackful of money,' said he", " 'Is that so very wonderful?'

I know that,' said the man", ' After some time had passed the man had a mind to visit his second eldest daughter  His wife again gave him some dry bread to eat, and when he grew tired and hungry he sat down on the east side of a mound and began to eat it  As he sat there his daughter came up out of the mound, and invited him to come inside, which he did very willingly  Soon after this the troll came home  It was dark by that time, and his wife bade him go and buy some candles', " 'Oh, we shall soon get a light,' said the troll", ' With that he dipped his fingers into the fire, and they then gave light without being burned in the least  The old man got two sacks of money here, and plodded away homewards with these Yes, in a thousand years people will fly on the wings of steam through the air, over the ocean!

The Thames, the Danube, and the Rhine still roll their course, Mont Blanc stands firm with its snow-capped summit, and the Northern Lights gleam over the land of the North; but generation after generation has become dust, whole rows of the mighty of the moment are forgotten, like those who already slumber under the hill on which the rich trader, whose ground it is, has built a bench, on which he can sit and look out across his waving corn fields  "To Europe!" cry the young sons of America; "to the land of our ancestors, the glorious land of monuments and fancy--to Europe!" The ship of the air comes  It is crowded with passengers, for the transit is quicker than by sea  The electro-magnetic wire under the ocean has already telegraphed the number of the aerial caravan  Europe is in sight  It is the coast of Ireland that they see, but the passengers are still asleep; they will not be called till they are exactly over England  There they will first step on European shore, in the land of Shakespeare, as the educated call it; in the land of politics, the land of machines, as it is called by others  Here they stay a whole day  That is all the time the busy race can devote to the whole of England and Scotland  Then the journey is continued through the tunnel under the English Channel, to France, the land of Charlemagne and Napoleon  Moliere is named, the learned men talk of the classic school of remote antiquity  There is rejoicing and shouting for the names of heroes, poets, and men of science, whom our time does not know, but who will be born after our time in Paris, the centre of Europe, and elsewhere  The air steamboat flies over the country whence Columbus went forth, where Cortez was born, and where Calderon sang dramas in sounding verse  Beautiful black-eyed women live still in the blooming valleys, and the oldest songs speak of the Cid and the Alhambra  Then through the air, over the sea, to Italy, where once lay old, everlasting Rome  It has vanished!

but here and there, on the rich sites of those that time shall bring forth, the caravan sometimes descends, and departs thence again  Down below lies Germany, that was once covered with a close net of railway and canals, the region where Luther spoke, where Goethe sang, and Mozart once held the sceptre of harmony  Great names shine there, in science and in art, names that are unknown to us  One day devoted to seeing Germany, and one for the North, the country of Oersted and Linnaeus, and for Norway, the land of the old heroes and the young Normans  Iceland is visited on the journey home  The geysers burn no more, Hecla is an extinct volcano, but the rocky island is still fixed in the midst of the foaming sea, a continual monument of legend and poetry  "There is really a great deal to be seen in Europe," says the young American, "and we have seen it in a week, according to the directions of the great traveller" (and here he mentions the name of one of his contemporaries) "in his celebrated work, \'How to See All Europe in a Week \'"   Far away, in North America, where the Red Indians dwell, there lived a long time ago a beautiful maiden, who was lovelier than any other girl in the whole tribe  Many of the young braves sought her in marriage, but she would listen to one only--a handsome chief, who had taken her fancy some years before  So they were to be married, and great rejoicings were made, and the two looked forward to a long life of happiness together, when the very night before the wedding feast a sudden illness seized the girl, and, without a word to her friends who were weeping round her, she passed silently away  The heart of her lover had been set upon her, and the thought of her remained with him night and day  He put aside his bow, and went neither to fight nor to hunt, but from sunrise to sunset he sat by the place where she was laid, thinking of his happiness that was buried there  At last, after many days, a light seemed to come to him out of the darkness  He remembered having heard from the old, old people of the tribe, that there was a path that led to the Land of Souls--that if you sought carefully you could find it  So the next morning he got up early, and put some food in his pouch and slung an extra skin over his shoulders, for he knew not how long his journey would take, nor what sort of country he would have to go through  Only one thing he knew, that if the path was there, he would find it  At first he was puzzled, as there seemed no reason he should go in one direction more than another  Then all at once he thought he had heard one of the old men say that the Land of Souls lay to the south, and so, filled with new hope and courage, he set his face southwards  For many, many miles the country looked the same as it did round his own home  The forests, the hills, and the rivers all seemed exactly like the ones he had left  The only thing that was different was the snow, which had lain thick upon the hills and trees when he started, but grew less and less the farther he went south, till it disappeared altogether  Soon the trees put forth their buds, and flowers sprang up under his feet, and instead of thick clouds there was blue sky over his head, and everywhere the birds were singing  Then he knew that he was in the right road  The thought that he should soon behold his lost bride made his heart beat for joy, and he sped along lightly and swiftly  Now his way led through a dark wood, and then over some steep cliffs, and on the top of these he found a hut or wigwam', " An old man clothed in skins, and holding a staff in his hand, stood in the doorway; and he said to the young chief who was beginning to tell his story, 'I was waiting for you, wherefore you have come I know", ' It is but a short while since she whom you seek was here  Rest in my hut, as she also rested, and I will tell you what you ask, and whither you should go', "' On hearing these words, the young man entered the hut, but his heart was too eager within him to suffer him to rest, and when he arose, the old man rose too, and stood with him at the door", " 'Look,' he said, 'at the water which lies far out yonder, and the plains which stretch beyond", ' That is the Land of Souls, but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him  So, lay down your body here; your bow and arrows, your skin and your dog  They shall be kept for you safely', "' Then he turned away, and the young chief, light as air, seemed hardly to touch the ground; and as he flew along the scents grew sweeter and the flowers more beautiful, while the animals rubbed their noses against him, instead of hiding as he approached, and birds circled round him, and fishes lifted up their heads and looked as he went by", ' Very soon he noticed with wonder, that neither rocks nor trees barred his path  He passed through them without knowing it, for indeed, they were not rocks and trees at all, but only the souls of them; for this was the Land of Shadows  So he went on with winged feet till he came to the shores of a great lake, with a lovely island in the middle of it; while on the bank of the lake was a canoe of glittering stone, and in the canoe were two shining paddles  Father, and mother, and brothers, and sisters, were gone to the play; only little Anna and her grandpapa were left at home  "We\'ll have a play too," he said, "and it may begin immediately " "But we have no theatre," cried little Anna, "and we have no one to act for us; my old doll cannot, for she is a fright, and my new one cannot, for she must not rumple her new clothes " "One can always get actors if one makes use of what one has," observed grandpapa  "Now we\'ll go into the theatre  Here we will put up a book, there another, and there a third, in a sloping row  Now three on the other side; so, now we have the side scenes', " The old box that lies yonder may be the back stairs; and we'll lay the flooring on top of it", ' The stage represents a room, as every one may see  Now we want the actors  Let us see what we can find in the plaything-box  First the personages, and then we will get the play ready', " One after the other; that will be capital! Here's a pipe-head, and yonder an odd glove; they will do very well for father and daughter", '" "But those are only two characters," said little Anna  "Here\'s my brother\'s old waistcoat--could not that play in our piece, too?" "It\'s big enough, certainly," replied grandpapa  "It shall be the lover', " There's nothing in the pockets, and that's very interesting, for that's half of an unfortunate attachment", " And here we have the nut-cracker's boots, with spurs to them", ' Row, dow, dow! how they can stamp and strut! They shall represent the unwelcome wooer, whom the lady does not like  What kind of a play will you have now? Shall it be a tragedy, or a domestic drama?" "A domestic drama, please," said little Anna, "for the others are so fond of that  Do you know one?" "I know a hundred," said grandpapa  "Those that are most in favor are from the French, but they are not good for little girls', " In the meantime, we may take one of the prettiest, for inside they're all very much alike", " Now I shake the pen! Cock-a-lorum! So now, here's the play, brin-bran-span new! Now listen to the play-bill", '" And grandpapa took a newspaper, and read as if he were reading from it:         THE PIPE-HEAD AND THE GOOD HEAD           A Family Drama in One Act               CHARACTERS    MR  PIPE-HEAD, a father       MR  WAISTCOAT, a lover     MISS GLOVE, a daughter       MR Some years ago, large ships were sent towards the north pole, to explore the distant coasts, and to try how far men could penetrate into those unknown regions  For more than a year one of these ships had been pushing its way northward, amid snow and ice, and the sailors had endured many hardships; till at length winter set in, and the sun entirely disappeared; for many weeks there would be constant night  All around, as far as the eye could reach, nothing could be seen but fields of ice, in which the ship remained stuck fast  The snow lay piled up in great heaps, and of these the sailors made huts, in the form of bee-hives, some of them as large and spacious as one of the "Huns\' graves," and others only containing room enough to hold three or four men  It was not quite dark; the northern lights shot forth red and blue flames, like continuous fireworks, and the snow glittered, and reflected back the light, so that the night here was one long twilight  When the moon was brightest, the natives came in crowds to see the sailors  They had a very singular appearance in their rough, hairy dresses of fur, and riding in sledges over the ice  They brought with them furs and skins in great abundance, so that the snow-houses were soon provided with warm carpets, and the furs also served for the sailors to wrap themselves in, when they slept under the roofs of snow, while outside it was freezing with a cold far more severe than in the winter with us  In our country it was still autumn, though late in the season; and they thought of that in their distant exile, and often pictured to themselves the yellow leaves on the trees at home  Their watches pointed to the hours of evening, and time to go to sleep, although in these regions it was now always night  In one of the huts, two of the men laid themselves down to rest  The younger of these men had brought with him from home his best, his dearest treasure--a Bible, which his grandmother had given him on his departure  Every night the sacred volume rested under his head, and he had known from his childhood what was written in it  Every day he read in the book, and while stretched on his cold couch, the holy words he had learnt would come into his mind: "If I take the wings of the morning, and fly to the uttermost parts of the sea, even there Thou art with me, and Thy right hand shall uphold me;" and under the influence of that faith which these holy words inspired, sleep came upon him, and dreams, which are the manifestations of God to the spirit  The soul lives and acts, while the body is at rest  He felt this life in him, and it was as if he heard the sound of dear, well-known melodies, as if the breezes of summer floated around him; and over his couch shone a ray of brightness, as if it were shining through the covering of his snow-roof  He lifted his head, and saw that the bright gleaming was not the reflection of the glittering snow, but the dazzling brightness of the pinions of a mighty angel, into whose beaming face he was gazing  As from the cup of a lily, the angel rose from amidst the leaves of the Bible; and, stretching out his arm, the walls of the hut sunk down, as though they had been formed of a light, airy veil of mist, and the green hills and meadows of home, with its ruddy woods, lay spread around him in the quiet sunshine of a lovely autumn day  The nest of the stork was empty, but ripe fruit still hung on the wild apple-tree, although the leaves had fallen', " The red hips gleamed on the hedges, and the starling which hung in the green cage outside the window of the peasant's hut, which was his home, whistled the tune which he had taught him", " His grandmother hung green birds'-food around the cage, as he, her grandson, had been accustomed to do", ' The daughter of the village blacksmith, who was young and fair, stood at the well, drawing water  She nodded to the grandmother, and the old woman nodded to her, and pointed to a letter which had come from a long way off  That very morning the letter had arrived from the cold regions of the north; there, where the absent one was sweetly sleeping under the protecting hand of God', " They laughed and wept over the letter; and he, far away, amid ice and snow, under the shadow of the angel's wings, wept and smiled with them in spirit; for he saw and heard it all in his dream", ' From the letter they read aloud the words of Holy Writ: "In the uttermost parts of the sea, Thy right hand shall uphold me " And as the angel spread his wings like a veil over the sleeper, there was the sound of beautiful music and a hymn  Then the vision fled  It was dark again in the snow-hut: but the Bible still rested beneath his head, and faith and hope dwelt in his heart  God was with him, and he carried home in his heart, even "in the uttermost parts of the sea That same morning early, the princess woke in a terrible fright  There was a hideous noise in her room--creatures snarling and hissing and rocketing about as if they were fighting  The moment she came to herself, she remembered something she had never thought of again--what her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened  She immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow  As she did so she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under her palm', " 'It must be my grandmother!' she said to herself, and the thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty little slippers before running from the room", ' While doing this she caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue, thrown over the back of a chair by the bedside  She had never seen it before but it was evidently waiting for her', " She put it on, and then, feeling with the forefinger of her right hand, soon found her grandmother's thread, which she proceeded at once to follow, expecting it would lead her straight up the old stair", ' When she reached the door she found it went down and ran along the floor, so that she had almost to crawl in order to keep a hold of it  Then, to her surprise, and somewhat to her dismay, she found that instead of leading her towards the stair it turned in quite the opposite direction  It led her through certain narrow passages towards the kitchen, turning aside ere she reached it, and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard  Some of the maids were already up, and this door was standing open  Across the yard the thread still ran along the ground, until it brought her to a door in the wall which opened upon the Mountainside  When she had passed through, the thread rose to about half her height, and she could hold it with ease as she walked  It led her straight up the mountain  The cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed', " The cook's great black cat, pursued by the housekeeper's terrier, had bounced against her bedroom door, which had not been properly fastened, and the two had burst into the room together and commenced a battle royal", ' How the nurse came to sleep through it was a mystery, but I suspect the old lady had something to do with it  It was a clear warm morning  The wind blew deliciously over the Mountainside  Here and there she saw a late primrose but she did not stop to call upon them  The sky was mottled with small clouds  The sun was not yet up, but some of their fluffy edges had caught his light, and hung out orange and gold-coloured fringes upon the air  The dew lay in round drops upon the leaves, and hung like tiny diamond ear-rings from the blades of grass about her path', " 'How lovely that bit of gossamer is!' thought the princess, looking at a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the hill", ' It was not the time for gossamers though; and Irene soon discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in the light of the morning  It was leading her she knew not whither; but she had never in her life been out before sunrise, and everything was so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming, that she felt too happy to be afraid of anything  After leading her up a good distance, the thread turned to the left, and down the path upon which she and Lootie had met Curdie  But she never thought of that, for now in the morning light, with its far outlook over the country, no path could have been more open and airy and cheerful' ,  " When the princess awoke from the sweetest of sleeps, she found her nurse bending over her, the housekeeper looking over the nurse's shoulder, and the laundry-maid looking over the housekeeper's", ' The room was full of women-servants; and the gentlemen-at-arms, with a long column of servants behind them, were peeping, or trying to peep in at the door of the nursery', " 'Are those horrid creatures gone?' asked the princess, remembering first what had terrified her in the morning", " 'You naughty, naughty little princess!' cried Lootie", ' Her face was very pale, with red streaks in it, and she looked as if she were going to shake her; but Irene said nothing--only waited to hear what should come next', " 'How could you get under the clothes like that, and make us all fancy you were lost! And keep it up all day too! You are the most obstinate child! It's anything but fun to us, I can tell you!' It was the only way the nurse could account for her disappearance", " 'I didn't do that, Lootie,' said Irene, very quietly", " 'Don't tell stories!' cried her nurse quite rudely", " 'I shall tell you nothing at all,' said Irene", " 'That's just as bad,' said the nurse", " 'Just as bad to say nothing at all as to tell stories?' exclaimed the princess", " 'I will ask my papa about that", " He won't say so", " And I don't think he will like you to say so", "' 'Tell me directly what you mean by it!' screamed the nurse, half wild with anger at the princess and fright at the possible consequences to herself", ' \'When I tell you the truth, Lootie,\' said the princess, who somehow did not feel at all angry, \'you say to me "Don\'t tell stories": it seems I must tell stories before you will believe me', "' 'You are very rude, princess,' said the nurse", " 'You are so rude, Lootie, that I will not speak to you again till you are sorry", " Why should I, when I know you will not believe me?' returned the princess", ' For she did know perfectly well that if she were to tell Lootie what she had been about, the more she went on to tell her, the less would she believe her', " 'You are the most provoking child!' cried her nurse", " 'You deserve to be well punished for your wicked behaviour", "' 'Please, Mrs Housekeeper,' said the princess, 'will you take me to your room, and keep me till my king-papa comes? I will ask him to come as soon as he can", "' Every one stared at these words", ' Up to this moment they had all regarded her as little more than a baby', " But the housekeeper was afraid of the nurse, and sought to patch matters up, saying: 'I am sure, princess, nursie did not mean to be rude to you", "' 'I do not think my papa would wish me to have a nurse who spoke to me as Lootie does", ' If she thinks I tell lies, she had better either say so to my papa, or go away', " Sir Walter, will you take charge of me?' 'With the greatest of pleasure, princess,' answered the captain of the gentlemen-at-arms, walking with his great stride into the room", " The crowd of servants made eager way for him, and he bowed low before the little princess's bed" ,  '***There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals  One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back  Perhaps some accident has befallen him, said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away  Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said, scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three  But of these also, none came home again, and of the pack of hounds which they had taken with them, none were seen again  From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it  This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest  The king, however, would not give his consent, and said, it is not safe in there, I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again  The huntsman replied, lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing  The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest  It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it, but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under  When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water  When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees  They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle  There was great astonishment over the wild man, the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his court-yard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping  And from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety  The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the court-yard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage  The boy ran thither and said, give me my ball out  Not till you have opened the door for me, answered the man  No, said the boy, I will not do that, the king has forbidden it, and ran away  The next day he again went and asked for his ball  The wild man said, open my door, but the boy would not  On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key', " Then the wild man said, it lies under your mother's pillow, you can get it there", ' The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key  The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers  When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away  The boy had become afraid, he called and cried after him, oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten  The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest  When the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened  Once there was a poor widow, as often there has been, and she had one son', " A very scarce summer came, and they didn't know how they'd live till the new potatoes would be fit for eating", ' So Jack said to his mother one evening, "Mother, bake my cake, and kill my hen, till I go seek my fortune; and if I meet it, never fear but I\'ll soon be back to share it with you " So she did as he asked her, and he set out at break of day on his journey  His mother came along with him to the yard gate, and says she, "Jack, which would you rather have, half the cake and half the hen with my blessing, or the whole of \'em with my curse?" "O musha, mother," says Jack, "why do you ax me that question? sure you know I wouldn\'t have your curse and Damer\'s estate along with it " "Well, then, Jack," says she, "here\'s the whole lot of \'em with my thousand blessings along with them " So she stood on the yard fence and blessed him as far as her eyes could see him', " Well, he went along and along till he was tired, and ne'er a farmer's house he went into wanted a boy", ' At last his road led by the side of a bog, and there was a poor ass up to his shoulders near a big bunch of grass he was striving to come at  "Ah, then, Jack asthore," says he, "help me out or I\'ll be drowned " "Never say\'t twice," says Jack, and he pitched in big stones and sods into the slob, till the ass got good ground under him  "Thank you, Jack," says he, when he was out on the hard road; "I\'ll do as much for you another time  Where are you going?" "Faith, I\'m going to seek my fortune till harvest comes in, God bless it!" "And if you like," says the ass, "I\'ll go along with you; who knows what luck we may have!" "With all my heart, it\'s getting late, let us be jogging " Well, they were going through a village, and a whole army of gossoons were hunting a poor dog with a kettle tied to his tail  He ran up to Jack for protection, and the ass let such a roar out of him, that the little thieves took to their heels as if the ould boy was after them  "More power to you, Jack," says the dog  "I\'m much obleeged to you: where is the baste and yourself going?" "We\'re going to seek our fortune till harvest comes in " "And wouldn\'t I be proud to go with you!" says the dog, "and get rid of them ill conducted boys; purshuin\' to \'em " "Well, well, throw your tail over your arm, and come along " They got outside the town, and sat down under an old wall, and Jack pulled out his bread and meat, and shared with the dog; and the ass made his dinner on a bunch of thistles  While they were eating and chatting, what should come by but a poor half-starved cat, and the moll-row he gave out of him would make your heart ache  "You look as if you saw the tops of nine houses since breakfast," says Jack; "here\'s a bone and something on it " "May your child never know a hungry belly!" says Tom; "it\'s myself that\'s in need of your kindness  May I be so bold as to ask where yez are all going?" "We\'re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in, and you may join us if you like " "And that I\'ll do with a heart and a half," says the cat, "and thank\'ee for asking me "\' Off they set again, and just as the shadows of the trees were three times as long as themselves, they heard a great cackling in a field inside the road, and out over the ditch jumped a fox with a fine black cock in his mouth  "Oh, you anointed villain!" says the ass, roaring like thunder  "At him, good dog!" says Jack, and the word wasn\'t out of his mouth when Coley was in full sweep after the Red Dog  Reynard dropped his prize like a hot potato, and was off like shot, and the poor cock came back fluttering and trembling to Jack and his comrades  "O musha, naybours!" says he, "wasn\'t it the height o\' luck that threw you in my way! Maybe I won\'t remember your kindness if ever I find you in hardship; and where in the world are you all going?" "We\'re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in; you may join our party if you like, and sit on Neddy\'s crupper when your legs and wings are tired  A poor woman had three sons  The eldest and second eldest were cunning clever fellows, but they called the youngest Jack the Fool, because they thought he was no better than a simpleton', " The eldest got tired of staying at home, and said he'd go look for service", ' He stayed away a whole year, and then came back one day, dragging one foot after the other, and a poor wizened face on him, and he as cross as two sticks  When he was rested and got something to eat, he told them how he got service with the Gray Churl of the Townland of Mischance, and that the agreement was, whoever would first say he was sorry for his bargain, should get an inch wide of the skin of his back, from shoulder to hips, taken off  If it was the master, he should also pay double wages; if it was the servant, he should get no wages at all  "But the thief," says he, "gave me so little to eat, and kept me so hard at work, that flesh and blood couldn\'t stand it; and when he asked me once, when I was in a passion, if I was sorry for my bargain, I was mad enough to say I was, and here I am disabled for life " Vexed enough were the poor mother and brothers; and the second eldest said on the spot he\'d go and take service with the Gray Churl, and punish him by all the annoyance he\'d give him till he\'d make him say he was sorry for his agreement  "Oh, won\'t I be glad to see the skin coming off the old villain\'s back!" said he  All they could say had no effect: he started off for the Townland of Mischance, and in a twelvemonth he was back just as miserable and helpless as his brother', " All the poor mother could say didn't prevent Jack the Fool from starting to see if he was able to regulate the Gray Churl", ' He agreed with him for a year for twenty pounds, and the terms were the same  "Now, Jack," said the Gray Churl, "if you refuse to do anything you are able to do, you must lose a month\'s wages " "I\'m satisfied," said Jack; "and if you stop me from doing a thing after telling me to do it, you are to give me an additional month\'s wages " "I am satisfied," says the master  "Or if you blame me for obeying your orders, you must give the same " "I am satisfied," said the master again  The first day that Jack served he was fed very poorly, and was worked to the saddleskirts  Next day he came in just before the dinner was sent up to the parlour  They were taking the goose off the spit, but well becomes Jack he whips a knife off the dresser, and cuts off one side of the breast, one leg and thigh, and one wing, and fell to  In came the master, and began to abuse him for his assurance  "Oh, you know, master, you\'re to feed me, and wherever the goose goes won\'t have to be filled again till supper  Are you sorry for our agreement?" The master was going to cry out he was, but he bethought himself in time  "Oh no, not at all," said he  "That\'s well," said Jack  Next day Jack was to go clamp turf on the bog', " They weren't sorry to have him away from the kitchen at dinner time", ' He didn\'t find his breakfast very heavy on his stomach; so he said to the mistress, "I think, ma\'am, it will be better for me to get my dinner now, and not lose time coming home from the bog " "That\'s true, Jack," said she', " So she brought out a good cake, and a print of butter, and a bottle of milk, thinking he'd take them away to the bog" ,  ' ONCE upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottage with her only son Jack  Jack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kind-hearted and affectionate  There had been a hard winter, and after it the poor woman had suffered from fever and ague  Jack did no work as yet, and by degrees they grew dreadfully poor', " The widow saw that there was no means of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling her cow; so one morning she said to her son, 'I am too weak to go myself, Jack, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her", "' Jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was on the way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand", ' Jack stopped to look at them, and the butcher told the boy that they were of great value, and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow for these beans  When he brought them home to his mother instead of the money she expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed many tears, scolding Jack for his folly  He was very sorry, and mother and son went to bed very sadly that night; their last hope seemed gone  At daybreak Jack rose and went out into the garden', " 'At least,' he thought, 'I will sow the wonderful beans", ' Mother says that they are just common scarlet-runners, and nothing else; but I may as well sow them', "' So he took a piece of stick, and made some holes in the ground, and put in the beans", ' That day they had very little dinner, and went sadly to bed, knowing that for the next day there would be none and Jack, unable to sleep from grief and vexation, got up at day-dawn and went out into the garden  What was his amazement to find that the beans had grown up in the night, and climbed up and up till they covered the high cliff that sheltered the cottage, and disappeared above it! The stalks had twined and twisted themselves together till they formed quite a ladder', " 'It would be easy to climb it,' thought Jack", ' And, having thought of the experiment, he at once resolved to carry it out, for Jack was a good climber  However, after his late mistake about the cow, he thought he had better consult his mother first', " WONDERFUL GROWTH OF THE BEANSTALK So Jack called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at the Beanstalk, which was not only of great height, but was thick enough to bear Jack's weight", " 'I wonder where it ends,' said Jack to his mother; 'I think I will climb up and see", "' His mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jack coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain there must be something wonderful in the Beanstalk; so at last she yielded to his wishes", ' Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-like bean till everything he had left behind him--the cottage, the village, and even the tall church tower--looked quite little, and still he could not see the top of the Beanstalk  Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would go back again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the way to succeed in anything is not to give up  So after resting for a moment he went on  After climbing higher and higher, till he grew afraid to look down for fear he should be giddy, Jack at last reached the top of the Beanstalk, and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded, with beautiful meadows covered with sheep  A crystal stream ran through the pastures; not far from the place where he had got off the Beanstalk stood a fine, strong castle  Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle before; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was as much separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which it stood as if it were in another land  While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange-looking woman came out of the wood, and advanced towards him  She wore a pointed cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine, her hair streamed loose over her shoulders, and she walked with a staff  Jack took off his cap and made her a bow  Down in Fannet, in times gone by, lived Jamie Freel and his mother', " Jamie was the widow's sole support; his strong arm worked for her untiringly, and as each Saturday night came round he poured his wages into her lap, thanking her dutifully for the halfpence which she returned him for tobacco", ' He was extolled by his neighbours as the best son ever known or heard of  But he had neighbours of whose opinions he was ignorant--neighbours who lived pretty close to him, whom he had never seen, who are, indeed, rarely seen by mortals, except on May Eves or Halloweens  An old ruined castle, about a quarter of a mile from his cabin, was said to be the abode of the "wee folk " Every Halloween were the ancient windows lighted up, and passersby saw little figures flitting to and fro inside the building, while they heard the music of flutes and pipes  It was well known that fairy revels took place; but nobody had the courage to intrude on them  Jamie had often watched the little figures from a distance, and listened to the charming music, wondering what the inside of the castle was like; but one Halloween he got up, and took his cap, saying to his mother, "I\'m awa to the castle to seek my fortune " "What!" cried she  "Would you venture there--you that\'s the widow\'s only son? Dinna be sae venturesome and foolitch, Jamie! They\'ll kill you, an\' then what\'ll come o\' me?" "Never fear, mother; nae harm\'ll happen me, but I maun gae " He set out, and, as he crossed the potato field, came in sight of the castle, whose windows were ablaze with light that seemed to turn the russet leaves, still clinging to the crab-tree branches, into gold  Halting in the grove at one side of the ruin, he listened to the elfin revelry, and the laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed  Numbers of little people, the largest about the size of a child of five years old, were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles, while others drank and feasted  "Welcome, Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!" cried the company, perceiving their visitor  The word "Welcome" was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle  Time flew, and Jamie was enjoying himself very much, when his hosts said, "We\'re going to ride to Dublin to-night to steal a young lady  Will you come, too, Jamie Freel?" "Ay, that I will," cried the rash youth, thirsting for adventure  A troop of horses stood at the door  Jamie mounted, and his steed rose with him into the air', " He was presently flying over his mother's cottage, surrounded by the elfin troop, and on and on they went, over bold mountains, over little hills, over the deep Lough Swilley, over towns and cottages, where people were burning nuts and eating apples and keeping merry Halloween", ' It seemed to Jamie that they flew all round Ireland before they got to Dublin  "This is Derry," said the fairies, flying over the cathedral spire; and what was said by one voice was repeated by all the rest, till fifty little voices were crying out, "Derry! Derry! Derry!" In like manner was Jamie informed as they passed over each town on the route, and at length he heard the silvery voices cry, "Dublin! Dublin!" It was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but one of the finest houses in Stephen\'s Green  The troop dismounted near a window, and Jamie saw a beautiful face on a pillow in a splendid bed  He saw the young lady lifted and carried away, while the stick which was dropped in her place on the bed took her exact form  The lady was placed before one rider and carried a short way, then given another, and the names of the towns were cried as before  They were approaching home  Jamie heard "Rathmullan," "Milford," "Tamney," and then he knew they were near his own house  "You\'ve all had your turn at carrying the young lady," said he  "Why wouldn\'t I get her for a wee piece?" "Ay, Jamie," replied they pleasantly, "you may take your turn at carrying her, to be sure " Holding his prize very tightly he dropped down near his mother\'s door  There was once a king who ruled over a kingdom somewhere between sunrise and sunset  It was as small as kingdoms usually were in old times, and when the king went up to the roof of his palace and took a look round he could see to the ends of it in every direction  But as it was all his own, he was very proud of it, and often wondered how it would get along without him  He had only one child, and that was a daughter, so he foresaw that she must be provided with a husband who would be fit to be king after him  Where to find one rich enough and clever enough to be a suitable match for the princess was what troubled him, and often kept him awake at night  At last he devised a plan  He made a proclamation over all his kingdom (and asked his nearest neighbours to publish it in theirs as well) that whoever could bring him a dozen of the finest pearls the king had ever seen, and could perform certain tasks that would be set him, should have his daughter in marriage and in due time succeed to the throne  The pearls, he thought, could only be brought by a very wealthy man, and the tasks would require unusual talents to accomplish them  There were plenty who tried to fulfil the terms which the king proposed  Rich merchants and foreign princes presented themselves one after the other, so that some days the number of them was quite annoying; but, though they could all produce magnificent pearls, not one of them could perform even the simplest of the tasks set them  Some turned up, too, who were mere adventurers, and tried to deceive the old king with imitation pearls; but he was not to be taken in so easily, and they were soon sent about their business  At the end of several weeks the stream of suitors began to fall off, and still there was no prospect of a suitable son-in-law', " Now it so happened that in a little corner of the king's dominions, beside the sea, there lived a poor fisher, who had three sons, and their names were Peter, Paul, and Jesper", ' Peter and Paul were grown men, while Jesper was just coming to manhood  The two elder brothers were much bigger and stronger than the youngest, but Jesper was far the cleverest of the three, though neither Peter nor Paul would admit this  It was a fact, however, as we shall see in the course of our story  One day the fisherman went out fishing, and among his catch for the day he brought home three dozen oysters  When these were opened, every shell was found to contain a large and beautiful pearl  Hereupon the three brothers, at one and the same moment, fell upon the idea of offering themselves as suitors for the princess  After some discussion, it was agreed that the pearls should be divided by lot, and that each should have his chance in the order of his age: of course, if the oldest was successful the other two would be saved the trouble of trying', " Next morning Peter put his pearls in a little basket, and set off for the king's palace", ' He had not gone far on his way when he came upon the King of the Ants and the King of the Beetles, who, with their armies behind them, were facing each other and preparing for battle', " 'Come and help me,' said the King of the Ants; 'the beetles are too big for us", ' I may help you some day in return', "' 'I have no time to waste on other people's affairs,' said Peter; 'just fight away as best you can;' and with that he walked off and left them", ' A little further on the way he met an old woman', " 'Good morning, young man,' said she; 'you are early astir", " What have you got in your basket?' 'Cinders,' said Peter promptly, and walked on, adding to himself, 'Take that for being so inquisitive", "' 'Very well, cinders be it,' the old woman called after him, but he pretended not to hear her", ' Very soon he reached the palace, and was at once brought before the king There was once an old castle in the midst of a large and dense forest, and in it an old woman who was a witch dwelt all alone  In the day-time she changed herself into a car or a screech-owl, but in the evening she took her proper shape again as a human being  She could lure wild beasts and birds to her, and then she killed and boiled and roasted them  If anyone came within one hundred paces of the castle he was obliged to stand still, and could not stir from the place until she bade him be free  But whenever an innocent maiden came within this circle, she changed her into a bird, and shut her up in a wicker-work cage, and carried the cage into a room in the castle  She had about seven thousand cages of rare birds in the castle  Now, there was once a maiden who was called jorinda, who was fairer than all other girls  She and a handsome youth named joringel had promised to marry each other  They were still in the days of betrothal, and their greatest happiness was being together  One day in order that they might be able to talk together in peace they went for a walk in the forest  Take care, said joringel, that you do not go too near the castle  It was a beautiful evening  The sun shone brightly between the trunks of the trees into the dark green of the forest, and the turtle-doves sang mournfully upon the beech trees  Jorinda wept now and then  She sat down in the sunshine and was sorrowful  Joringel was sorrowful too  They were as sad as if they were about to die  Then they looked around them, and were quite at a loss, for they did not know by which way they should go home  The sun was still half above the mountain and half under  Joringel looked through the bushes, and saw the old walls of the castle close at hand  He was horror-stricken and filled with deadly fear  Jorinda was singing,      my little bird, with the necklace red,      sings sorrow, sorrow, sorrow,      he sings that the dove must soon be dead,      sings sorrow, sor - jug, jug, jug  Joringel looked for jorinda  She was changed into a nightingale, and sang, jug, jug, jug  A screech-owl with glowing eyes flew three times round about her, and three times cried, to-whoo, to-whoo, to-whoo  Joringel could not move  He stood there like a stone, and could neither weep nor speak, nor move hand or foot  The sun had now set  The owl flew into the thicket, and directly afterwards there came out of it a crooked old woman, yellow and lean, with large red eyes and a hooked nose, the point of which reached to her chin  She muttered to herself, caught the nightingale, and took it away in her hand  THERE was once upon a time a King who had become a widower  His Queen had left one daughter behind her, and she was so wise and so pretty that it was impossible for any one to be wiser or prettier  For a long time the King went sorrowing for his wife, for he had loved her exceedingly; but at last he grew tired of living alone, and married a Queen who was a widow, and she also had a daughter, who was just as ill-favoured and wicked as the other was good and beautiful', " The stepmother and her daughter were envious of the King's daughter because she was so pretty, but so long as the King was at home they dared do her no harm, because his love for her was so great", " Then there came a time when he made war on another King and went away to fight, and then the new Queen thought that she could do what she liked; so she both hungered and beat the King's daughter and chased her about into every corner", ' At last she thought that everything was too good for her, and set her to work to look after the cattle  So she went about with the cattle, and herded them in the woods and in the fields  Of food she got little or none, and grew pale and thin, and was nearly always weeping and sad', " Among the herd there was a great blue bull, which always kept itself very smart and sleek, and often came to the King's daughter and let her stroke him", ' So one day, when she was again sitting crying and sorrowing, the Bull came up to her and asked why she was always so full of care? She made no answer, but continued to weep', " 'Well,' said the Bull, 'I know what it is, though you will not tell me; you are weeping because the Queen is unkind to you, and because she wants to starve you to death", ' But you need be under no concern about food, for in my left ear there lies a cloth, and if you will but take it and spread it out, you can have as many dishes as you like', "' So she did this, and took the cloth and spread it out upon the grass, and then it was covered with the daintiest dishes that any one could desire, and there was wine, and mead, and cake", ' And now she became brisk and well again, and grew so rosy, and plump, and fair that the Queen and her scraggy daughter turned blue and white with vexation at it  The Queen could not imagine how her step-daughter could look so well on such bad food, so she ordered one of her handmaidens to follow her into the wood and watch her, and see how it was, for she thought that some of the servants must be giving her food', " So the maid followed her into the wood and watched, and saw how the step-daughter took the cloth out of the Blue Bull's ear, and spread it out, and how the cloth was then covered with the most delicate dishes, which the step-daughter ate and regaled herself with", ' So the waiting-maid went home and told the Queen  And now the King came home, and he had conquered the other King with whom he had been at war', " So there was great gladness in the palace, but no one was more glad than the King's daughter", ' The Queen, however, pretended to be ill, and gave the doctor much money to say that she would never be well again unless she had some of the flesh of the Blue Bull to eat', " Both the King's daughter and the people in the palace asked the doctor if there were no other means of saving her, and begged for the Bull's life, for they were all fond of him, and they all declared that there was no such Bull in the whole country; but it was all in vain, he was to be killed, and should be killed, and nothing else would serve", " When the King's daughter heard it she was full of sorrow, and went down to the byre to the Bull", ' He too was standing there hanging his head, and looking so downcast that she fell a-weeping over him', " 'What are you weeping for?' said the Bull", ' So she told him that the King had come home again, and that the Queen had pretended to be ill, and that she had made the doctor say that she could never be well again unless some of the flesh of the Blue Bull was given her to eat, and that now he was to be killed', " 'When once they have taken my life they will soon kill you also,' said the Bull", " 'If you are of the same mind with me, we will take our departure this very night", "' The King's daughter thought that it was bad to go and leave her father, but that it was worse still to be in the same house with the Queen, so she promised the Bull that she would come", " At night, when all the others had gone to bed, the King's daughter stole softly down to the byre to the Bull, and he took her on his back and got out of the courtyard as quickly as he could", ' So at cock-crow next morning, when the people came to kill the Bull, he was gone, and when the King got up and asked for his daughter she was gone too A king had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure, but so proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good enough for her  She sent away one after the other, and ridiculed them as well  Once the king made a great feast and invited thereto, from far and near, all the young men likely to marry  They were all marshalled in a row according to their rank and standing  First came the kings, then the grand-dukes, then the princes, the earls, the barons, and the gentry', " Then the king's daughter was led through the ranks, but to each one she had some objection to make", ' One was too fat, the wine-barrel, she said  Another was too tall, long and thin has little in  The third was too short, short and thick is never quick  The fourth was too pale, as pale as death  The fifth too red, a fighting cock  The sixth was not straight enough, a green log dried behind the stove  So she had something to say against each one, but she made herself especially merry over a good king who stood quite high up in the row, and whose chin had grown a little crooked', " Look, she cried and laughed, he has a chin like a thrush's beak", ' And from that time he got the name of king thrushbeard  But the old king, when he saw that his daugher did nothing but mock the people, and despised all the suitors who were gathered there, was very angry, and swore that she should have for her husband the very first beggar that came to his doors  A few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the windows, trying to earn a few pennies  When the king heard him he said, let him come up  So the fiddler came in, in his dirty, ragged clothes, and sang before the king and his daughter, and when he had ended he asked for a trifling gift  The king said, your song has pleased me so well that I will give you my daughter there, to wife', " The king's daughter shuddered, but the king said, I have taken an oath to give you to the very first beggar-man and I will keep it", ' All she could say was in vain  The priest was brought, and she had to let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the spot  When that was done the king said, now it is not proper for you, a beggar-woman, to stay any longer in my palace, you may just go away with your husband  The beggar-man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to walk away on foot with him  When they came to a large forest she asked, to whom does that beautiful forest belong  It belongs to king thrushbeard  If you had taken him, it would have been yours  Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken king thrushbeard  Afterwards they came to a meadow, and she asked again, to whom does this beautiful green meadow belong  More than two thousand years ago there lived a king in the land of Macedon who was a great conqueror, and when his son, Alexander, was born, the soothsayers and the priestesses of the temples predicted that he would be a greater warrior than his father  Alexander was a wonderful boy, and his father, King Philip, was very proud of him when he tamed a spirited horse which nobody else could manage', " The wisest philosophers of the day were Alexander's teachers, and when he was only sixteen years of age, Philip left him in charge of the country when he went to subdue Byzantium", ' Alexander was only twenty when he ascended the throne, but before then he had suppressed a rebellion and had proved himself possessed of exceptional daring and courage  "I shall conquer the whole world," he said, and although he only reigned thirteen years and died at the age of thirty-three, he accomplished his ambition  All the countries which were then known had to acknowledge his supremacy  King Alexander was a drunkard and very cruel, but he treated the Jews kindly  When they heard he had been victorious over Darius, king of Persia, who was their ruler, and that he was marching on Jerusalem, they became seriously alarmed  Jadua, the high priest, however, counseled the people to welcome Alexander with great ceremony  All the priests and the Levites donned their most gorgeous robes, the populace put on their holiday garb, and the streets of the city were gaily decorated with many colored banners and garlands of flowers  The night before Alexander arrived at the head of his army, a long procession was formed of the priests, the Levites, and the elders of the city, each carrying a lighted torch  At the gates of the city they awaited the approach of the mighty warrior  In the early morning, before the sun had risen, Alexander made his appearance and was astonished at the magnificent spectacle which met his gaze  At the head of the procession stood the high priest in his shining white robes, with the jewels of the ephod glittering on his breast  To the surprise of his generals, Alexander descended from his horse and bowed low before the high priest  "Like unto an angel dost thou appear to me," he said  "Let thy coming bring peace," replied Jadua  Parmenio, the chief of Alexander\'s generals, had promised the soldiers rich store of plunder in Jerusalem, and he approached the king and said: "Wherefore do you honor this priest of the Jews above all men?" "I will tell thee," answered Alexander  "In dreams have I often seen this dignified priest  Ever he bade me be of good courage and always did he predict victory for me  Shall I not then pay homage to my guardian angel?" Turning to the priest, he said, "Lead me to your Temple that I may offer up thanksgiving to the God of my guardian angel " It was now daylight, and the priests walked in procession before King Alexander past cheering multitudes of people  At the Temple the king removed his sandals, but the priests gave him a pair of jeweled slippers, fearing that he might slip on the pavement  The king was pleased with all that he saw and desired that a statue of himself, or a portrait, should be placed in the holy building  "That may not be," replied the high priest, "but in honor of thy visit all the boys born in Jerusalem this year shall be named Alexander " "It is well," said the king, much pleased; "ask of me what you will, and if it be in my power I shall grant it " "Mighty monarch," said Jadua, "we desire naught but to be permitted to serve our God according to our laws  Permit us to practice our religious observances free and unhindered  Grant also this privilege to the Jews who dwell in all thy dominions, and we shall ever pray for thy long life and triumph " "It is but little that ye ask," replied the king, "and that little is easily granted  Godfrey de Bouillon was a famous warrior, a daring general and bold leader of men, who gained victories in several countries  And so, in the year 1095, when the first Crusade came to be arranged, he was entrusted with the command of one of the armies and led it across Europe in the historic march to the Holy Land  Like many a great soldier of his period, Godfrey was a cruel man, and, above all, he hated the Jews  "In this, our Holy War," he said to his men, "we shall slay all the children of Israel wherever we shall fall in with them  I shall not rest content until I have exterminated the Jews " True to his inhuman oath, Godfrey and his soldiers massacred large numbers of Jews  They did this without pity or mercy, saying: "We are performing a sacred duty, for we have the blessings of the priests on our enterprise " Godfrey felt sure he would be victorious, but he also wanted to obtain the blessing of a rabbi  It was a curious desire, but in those days such things were not considered at all strange, and so Godfrey de Bouillon sent for the learned Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac, better known by his world-famed name of Rashi  Rashi, one of the wisest sages of the Jews, came to Godfrey, and the two men stood facing each other  "Thou hast heard of my undertaking to capture Jerusalem," said Godfrey, haughtily  "I demand thy blessing on my venture " "Blessings are not in the gift of man; they are bestowed by Heaven--on worthy objects," answered Rashi  "Trifle not with words," retorted the warrior, "or they may cost thee dear  A holy man can invoke a blessing " But Rashi was not afraid  He was becoming an old man then, but he was as brave as the swaggering soldier, and he faced Godfrey unflinchingly  "I can make no claim on the God of Israel on behalf of one who has sworn to destroy all the descendants of His chosen people," he said  "So, ho!" exclaimed Godfrey, "you defy me " But he stopped his angry words abruptly  He had no wish to quarrel with any holy man, for that might make him nervous  And nervousness, then, was misunderstood as superstition  Besides, the rabbi might curse him  "If you will not bless," he said, "perhaps you will deign to raise the veil of the future for me  You wise men of the Jews are seers and can foretell events--so they say  A hundred thousand chariots filled with soldiers brave, determined and strong, are at my command  Tell me, shall I succeed, or fail?" "Thou wilt do both " Rashi replied  "What mean you?" demanded Godfrey, angrily  "This  There once lived a king and a queen who ruled over a very great kingdom', " They had large revenues, and lived happily with each other; but, as the years went past, the king's heart became heavy, because the queen had no children", ' She also sorrowed greatly over it, because, although the king said nothing to her about this trouble, yet she could see that it vexed him that they had no heir to the kingdom; and she wished every day that she might have one  One day a poor old woman came to the castle and asked to speak with the queen  The royal servants answered that they could not let such a poor beggar-woman go in to their royal mistress  They offered her a penny, and told her to go away  Then the woman desired them to tell the queen that there stood at the palace gate one who would help her secret sorrow  This message was taken to the queen, who gave orders to bring the old woman to her', " This was done, and the old woman said to her: 'I know your secret sorrow, O queen, and am come to help you in it", ' You wish to have a son; you shall have two if you follow my instructions', "' The queen was greatly surprised that the old woman knew her secret wish so well, and promised to follow her advice", " 'You must have a bath set in your room, O queen,' said she, 'and filled with running water", ' When you have bathed in this you will find  under the bath two red onions  These you must carefully peel and eat, and in time your wish will be fulfilled', "' The queen did as the poor woman told her; and after she had bathed she found the two onions under the bath", ' They were both alike in size and appearance  When she saw these she knew that the woman had been something more than she seemed to be, and in her delight she ate up one of the onions, skin and all  When she had done so she remembered that the woman had told her to peel them carefully before she ate them  It was now too late for the one of them, but she peeled the other and then ate it too  In due time it happened as the woman had said; but the first that the queen gave birth to was a hideous lindorm, or serpent  No one saw this but her waiting-woman, who threw it out of the window into the forest beside the castle  The next that came into the world was the most beautiful little prince, and he was shown to the king and queen, who knew nothing about his brother the lindorm', " There was now joy in all the palace and over the whole country on account of the beautiful prince; but no one knew that the queen's first-born was a lindorm, and lay in the wild forest", ' Time passed with the king, the queen, and the young prince in all happiness and prosperity, until he was twenty years of his age  Then his parents said to him that he should journey to another kingdom and seek for himself a bride, for they were beginning to grow old, and would fain see their son married  before they were laid in their grave  The prince obeyed, had his horses harnessed to his gilded chariot, and set out to woo his bride  But when he came to the first cross-ways there lay a huge and terrible lindorm right across the road, so that his horses had to come to a standstill', " 'Where are you driving to? ' asked the lindorm with a hideous voice" ,  "Och, I thought all the world, far and near, had heerd o' King O'Toole--well, well, but the darkness of mankind is untellible! Well, sir, you must know, as you didn't hear it afore, that there was a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine old king in the old ancient times, long ago; and it was he that owned the churches in the early days", " The king, you see, was the right sort; he was the real boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and hunting in particular; and from the rising o' the sun, up he got, and away he went over the mountains after the deer; and fine times they were", " Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the king had his health; but, you see, in course of time the king grew old, by raison he was stiff in his limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him, and he was lost entirely for want o' diversion, because he couldn't go a-hunting no longer; and, by dad, the poor king was obliged at last to get a goose to divert him", " Oh, you may laugh, if you like, but it's truth I'm telling you; and the way the goose diverted him was this-a-way: You see, the goose used to swim across the lake, and go diving for trout, and catch fish on a Friday for the king, and flew every other day round about the lake, diverting the poor king", " All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken in years like her master, and couldn't divert him no longer, and then it was that the poor king was lost entirely", " The king was walkin' one mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, and thinking of drowning himself, that could get no diversion in life, when all of a sudden, turning round the corner, who should he meet but a mighty decent young man coming up to him", ' "God save you," says the king to the young man  "God save you kindly, King O\'Toole," says the young man  "True for you," says the king  "I am King O\'Toole," says he, "prince and plennypennytinchery of these parts," says he; "but how came ye to know that?" says he  "Oh, never mind," says St  Kavin  You see it was Saint Kavin, sure enough--the saint himself in disguise, and nobody else  "Oh, never mind," says he, "I know more than that  May I make bold to ask how is your goose, King O\'Toole?" says he  "Blur-an-agers, how came ye to know about my goose?" says the king  "Oh, no matter; I was given to understand it," says Saint Kavin  After some more talk the king says, "What are you?" "I\'m an honest man," says Saint Kavin  "Well, honest man," says the king, "and how is it you make your money so aisy?" "By makin\' old things as good as new," says Saint Kavin  "Is it a tinker you are?" says the king  "No," says the saint; "I\'m no tinker by trade, King O\'Toole; I\'ve a better trade than a tinker," says he--"what would you say," says he, "if I made your old goose as good as new?" My dear, at the word of making his goose as good as new, you\'d think the poor old king\'s eyes were ready to jump out of his head  With that the king whistled, and down came the poor goose, just like a hound, waddling up to the poor cripple, her master, and as like him as two peas  The minute the saint clapt his eyes on the goose, "I\'ll do the job for you," says he, "King O\'Toole " "By _Jaminee_!" says King O\'Toole, "if you do, I\'ll say you\'re the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes " "Oh, by dad," says St  Kavin, "you must say more nor that--my horn\'s not so soft all out," says he, "as to repair your old goose for nothing; what\'ll you gi\' me if I do the job for you?--that\'s the chat," says St  Kavin  "I\'ll give you whatever you ask," says the king; "isn\'t that fair?" "Divil a fairer," says the saint; "that\'s the way to do business  Now," says he, "this is the bargain I\'ll make with you, King O\'Toole: will you gi\' me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after I make her as good as new?" "I will," says the king  "You won\'t go back o\' your word?" says St' ,  " There was wanst a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine ould king in the ould ancient times, long ago; and it was him that owned the Churches in the airly days", ' "Surely," said I, "the Churches were not in King O\'Toole\'s time?" "Oh, by no manes, your honor--throth, it\'s yourself that\'s right enough there; but you know the place is called \'The Churches\' bekase they wor built _afther_ by St', " Kavin, and wint by the name o' the Churches iver more; and, therefore, av coorse, the place bein' so called, I say that the King owned the Churches--and why not, sir, seein' 'twas his birthright, time out o' mind, beyant the flood? Well, the King (you see) was the right sort--he was the _rale_ boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and huntin' in partic'lar; and from the risin' o' the sun up he got, and away he wint over the mountains beyant afther the deer: and the fine times them wor; for the deer was as plinty thin, aye throth, far plintyer than the sheep is now; and that's the way it was with the King, from the crow o' the cock to the song o' the redbreast", " Well, it was all mighty good as long as the King had his health;

For you have a dear kitten just like yourself, and I have nobody to play with but you", "' 'Don't cry,' answered the cat, laying her paw on her mistress's arm", " 'Crying never does any good", ' I will see what can be done', "' The cat was as good as her word", ' As soon as she returned from her drive she trotted off to the forest to consult a fairy who dwelt there, and very soon after the queen had a little girl, who seemed made out of snow and sunbeams  The queen was delighted, and soon the baby began to take notice of the kitten as she jumped about the room, and would not go to sleep at all unless the kitten lay curled up beside her', " Two or three months went by, and though the baby was still a baby, the kitten was fast becoming a cat, and one evening when, as usual, the nurse came to look for her, to put her in the baby's cot, she was nowhere to be found", ' What a hunt there was for that kitten, to be sure! The servants, each anxious to find her, as the queen was certain to reward the lucky man, searched in the most impossible places', " Boxes were opened that would hardly have held the kitten's paw; books were taken from bookshelves, lest the kitten should have got behind them, drawers were pulled out, for perhaps the kitten might have got shut in", ' But it was all no use  The kitten had plainly run away, and nobody could tell if it would ever choose to come back  Years passed away, and one day, when the princess was playing ball in the garden, she happened to throw her ball farther than usual, and it fell into a clump of rose-bushes', " The princess of course ran after it at once, and she was stooping down to feel if it was hidden in the long grass, when she heard a voice calling her: 'Ingibjorg! Ingibjorg!' it said, 'have you forgotten me? I am Kisa, your sister!' 'But I never HAD a sister,' answered Ingibjorg, very much puzzled; for she knew nothing of what had taken place so long ago", " 'Don't you remember how I always slept in your cot beside you, and how you cried till I came? But girls have no memories at all! Why, I could find my way straight up to that cot this moment, if I was once inside the palace", "' 'Why did you go away then?' asked the princess", " But before Kisa could answer, Ingibjorg's attendants arrived breathless on the scene, and were so horrified at the sight of a strange cat, that Kisa plunged into the bushes and went back to the forest", ' The princess was very much vexed with her ladies-in-waiting for frightening away her old playfellow, and told the queen who came to her room every evening to bid her good-night', " 'Yes, it is quite true what Kisa said,' answered the queen; 'I should have liked to see her again", ' Perhaps, some day, she will return, and then you must bring her to me', "' Next morning it was very hot, and the princess declared that she must go and play in the forest, where it was always cool, under the big shady trees", ' As usual, her attendants let her do anything she pleased, and sitting down on a mossy bank where a little stream tinkled by, soon fell sound asleep  The princess saw with delight that they would pay no heed to her, and wandered on and on, expecting every moment to see some fairies dancing round a ring, or some little brown elves peeping at her from behind a tree  But, alas! she met none of these; instead, a horrible giant came out of his cave and ordered her to follow him  The princess felt much afraid, as he was so big and ugly, and began to be sorry that she had not stayed within reach of help; but as there was no use in disobeying the giant, she walked meekly behind  They went a long way, and Ingibjorg grew very tired, and at length began to cry', " 'I don't like girls who make horrid noises,' said the giant, turning round", " 'But if you WANT to cry, I will give you something to cry for" ,  'Between werrel and soist there lived a man whose name was knoist, and he had three sons  One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark-naked  Once on a time they went into a field, and there they saw a hare  The blind one shot it, the lame one caught it, the naked one put it in his pocket  Then they came to a mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed, one sank, the third had no bottom to it  They all three got into the one with no bottom to it  Then they came to a mighty big forest in which there was a mighty big tree, in the tree was a mighty big chapel - in the chapel was a sexton made of beech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy water with cudgels         How truly happy is that one        who can from holy water run    There was a King in his own time in Erin, and he went hunting one day  The King met a man whose head was out through his cap, whose elbows and knees were out through his clothing, and whose toes were out through his shoes  The man went up to the King, gave him a blow on the face, and drove three teeth from his mouth', " The same blow put the King's head in the dirt", ' When he rose from the earth, the King went back to his castle, and lay down sick and sorrowful  The King had three sons, and their names were Ur, Arthur, and Lawn Dyarrig  The three were at school that day, and came home in the evening  The father sighed when the sons were coming in  "What is wrong with our father?" asked the eldest  "Your father is sick on his bed," said the mother  The three sons went to their father and asked what was on him  "A strong man that I met to-day gave me a blow in the face, put my head in the dirt, and knocked three teeth from my mouth  What would you do to him if you met him?" asked the father of the eldest son  "If I met that man," replied Ur, "I would make four parts of him between four horses " "You are my son," said the King  "What would you do if you met him?" asked he then as he turned to the second son  "If I had a grip on that man I would burn him between four fires " "You, too, are my son  What would you do?" asked the King of Lawn Dyarrig  "If I met that man, I would do my best against him, and he might not stand long before me " "You are not my son  I would not lose lands or property on you," said the father  "You must go from me, and leave this to-morrow " On the following morning the three brothers rose with the dawn; the order was given Lawn Dyarrig to leave the castle and make his own way for himself  The other two brothers were going to travel the world to know could they find the man who had injured their father  Lawn Dyarrig lingered outside till he saw the two, and they going off by themselves  "It is a strange thing," said he, "for two men of high degree to go travelling without a servant " "We need no one," said Ur  "Company wouldn\'t harm us," said Arthur  The two let Lawn Dyarrig go with them as a serving-boy, and set out to find the man who had struck down their father  One day we, the Fianna, were all assembled, generous Fionn and all of us that lived were there; we were hunting on a misty morning nigh the bordering shores of Loch Lein, where through fragrant trees of sweetest blossoms, and the mellow music of birds at all times, we aroused the hornless deer of the best bounding, course, and agility; our hounds and all our dogs were close after in full chase', " 'Twas not long till we saw, westwards, a fleet rider advancing towards us, a young maiden of most beautiful appearance, on a slender white steed of swiftest power", " We all ceased from the chase on seeing the form of the royal maid; 'twas a surprise to Fionn and the Fianns, they never beheld a woman equal in beauty", ' A royal crown was on her head, and a brown mantle of precious silk, spangled with stars of red gold, covering her shoes down to the grass  A gold ring was hanging down from each yellow curl of her golden hair; her eyes were blue, clear, and cloudless, like a dewdrop on the top of the grass  Redder were her cheeks than the rose, fairer was her visage than the swan upon the wave, and more sweet was the taste of her balsam lips than honey mingled through red wine  A garment, wide, long, and smooth, covered the white steed; there was a comely saddle of red gold, and her right hand held a bridle with a golden bit  Four shoes, well shaped, were under him, of the yellow gold of the purest quality; a silver wreath was on the back of his head, and there was not in the world a steed better  She came to the presence of Fionn, and spoke with a voice sweet and gentle, and she said, "O King of the Fianna, long and distant is my journey now " "Who art thou thyself, O youthful princess! of fairest form, beauty, and countenance? Relate to us the cause of thy story, thine own name and thy country " "Golden-headed Niamh is my name, O sage Fionn of the great hosts  Beyond the women of the world I have won esteem; I am the fair daughter of the King of Youth " "Relate to us, O amiable princess, what caused thee to come afar across the sea--is it thy consort has forsaken thee, or what is the affliction that is on thyself?" "\'Tis not my husband that went from me; and as yet I have not been spoken of with any man, O King of the Fianna of highest repute; but affection and love I have given to thy son " "Which of my children is he, O blooming daughter, to whom thou hast given love, or yet affection? Do not conceal from us now the cause, and relate to us thy case, O woman " "I will tell thee that, O Fionn! Thy noble son of the well-tempered arms, high-spirited Oisin of the powerful hands, is the champion that I am now speaking of " "What is the reason that thou gavest love, O beautiful daughter of the glossy hair, to my own son beyond all, and multitudes of high lords under the sun?" "\'Tis not without cause, O King of the Fianna! I came afar for him--but reports I heard of his prowess, the goodness of his person and his mien  "Many a son of a king and a high chief gave me affection and perpetual love; I never consented to any man till I gave love to noble Oisin " "By that hand on thee, O Patrick, though it is not shameful to me as a story, there was not a limb of me but was in love with the beautiful daughter of the glossy hair " I, Oisin, took her hand in mine, and said in speech of sweetest tone, "A true, gentle welcome before thee, O young princess, to this country! \'Tis thou art the brightest and the fairest of form, \'tis thee I prefer as wife, thou art my choice beyond the women of the world, O mild star of loveliest countenance!" "Obligations unresisted by true heroes, O generous Oisin, I put upon thee to come with myself now upon my steed till we arrive at the \'Land of Youth', "' It is the most delightful country to be found, of greatest repute under the sun, trees drooping with fruit, and blossom and foliage growing on the tops of boughs", ' Abundant, there, are honey and wine and everything that eye has beheld; there will not come decline on thee with lapse of time; death or decay thou wilt not see  Thou wilt get feasts, playing, and drink; thou wilt get melodious music on the harp strings; thou wilt get silver and gold; thou wilt get also many jewels', " Thou wilt get the royal diadem of the 'King of Youth,' which he never yet gave to any person under the sun; 'twill protect thee both night and day, in battle, in tumult, and in rough conflict", ' Thou wilt get a fitting coat of protecting mail, and a gold-headed sword apt for strokes, from which no person ever escaped alive who once saw the sharp weapon  Thou wilt get everything I promised thee, and delights, also, which I may not mention; thou wilt get beauty, strength, and power, and I myself will be thy wife " "No refusal will I give from me," said I, "O charming queen of the golden curls! Thou art my choice above the women of the world, and I will go with willingness to the \'Land of Youth \'" On the back of the steed we went together  Before me sat the virgin; she said, "Oisin, let us remain quiet till we reach the mouth of the great sea " Then arose the steed swiftly; when we arrived on the borders of the strand he shook himself then to pace forward, and neighed three times aloud  When Fionn and the Fianna saw the steed travelling swiftly, facing the great tide, they raised three shouts of mourning and grief' ,  "Harry was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but drive his goat daily to pasture, he nevertheless groaned when he went home after his day's work was done", ' It is indeed a heavy burden, said he, and a wearisome employment to drive a goat into the field this way year after year, till late into the autumn', " If one could but lie down and sleep, but no, one must have one's eyes open lest the goat hurts the young trees, or squeezes itself through the hedge into a garden, or runs away altogether", " How can one have any rest, or enjoy one's life", ' He seated himself, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could set his shoulders free from this burden  For a long time all thinking was to no purpose, but suddenly it was as if scales fell from his eyes  I know what I will do, he cried, I will marry fat trina who has also a goat, and can take mine out with hers, and then I shall have no more need to trouble myself  So harry got up, set his weary legs in motion, and went right across the street, for it was no farther, to where the parents of fat trina lived, and asked for their industrious and virtuous daughter in marriage  The parents did not reflect long  Birds of a feather, flock together, they thought, and consented', " So fat trina became harry's wife, and led out both the goats", ' Harry had a good time of it, and had no work that he required to rest from but his own idleness  He went out with her only now and then, and said, I merely do it that I may afterwards enjoy rest more, otherwise one loses all feeling for it  But fat trina was no less idle  Dear harry, said she one day, why should we make our lives so toilsome when there is no need for it, and thus ruin the best days of our youth  Would it not be better for us to give the two goats which disturb us every morning in our sweetest sleep with their bleating, to our neighbor, and he will give us a beehive for them  We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and trouble ourselves no more about it  Bees do not require to be taken care of, or driven into the field  They fly out and find the way home again for themselves, and collect honey without giving the very least trouble  You have spoken like a sensible woman, replied harry', " We will carry out your proposal without delay, and besides all that, honey tastes better and nourishes one better than goat's milk, and it can be kept longer too", ' The neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats  The bees flew in and out from early morning till late evening without ever tiring, and filled the hive with the most beautiful honey, so that in autumn harry was able to take a whole pitcherful out of it  They placed the jug on a board which was fixed to the wall of their bed-room, and as they were afraid that it might be stolen, or that the mice might find it, trina brought in a stout hazel-stick and put it beside her bed, so that without unnecessary motion she might reach it with her hand, and drive away the uninvited guests  Lazy harry did not like to leave his bed before noon  He who rises early, said he, wastes his substance  One morning when he was still lying amongst the feathers in broad daylight, resting after his long sleep, he said to his wife, women are fond of sweet things, and you are always tasting the honey in private  It will be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling, before you eat up the whole of it  But, answered trina, not before we have a child to take care of them  Am I to worry myself with the little geese, and spend all my strength on them to no purpose Lean lisa was of a very different way of thinking from lazy harry and fat trina, who never let anything disturb their peace  She slaved away from morning till evening, and burdened her husband, long laurence, with so much work that he had heavier weights to carry than an ass with three sacks  But it was all to no purpose, for they had nothing and came to nothing  One night as she lay in bed, and could hardly move one limb for weariness, she still did not allow her thoughts to go to sleep', " She thrust her elbow into her husband's side, and said, listen, lenz, to what I have been thinking", ' If I were to find one florin and one was given to me, I would borrow another to put to them, and you too should give me another, and then as soon as I had got the four florins together, I would buy a young cow  This pleased the husband right well  It is true, said he, that I do not know where I am to get the florin which you want as a gift from me  But, if you can get the money together, and can buy a cow with it, you will do well to carry out your project  I shall be glad, he added, if the cow has a calf, and then I shall often get a drink of milk to refresh me  The milk is not for you, said the woman, we must let the calf suck that it may become big and fat, and we may be able to sell it well  Certainly, replied the man, but still we will take a little milk  That will do no harm  Who has taught you to manage cows, said the woman  Whether it does harm or not, I will not allow it, and even if you were to stand on your head for it, you should not have a drop of the milk  Do you think, because there is no satisfying you, long laurence, that you are to eat up what I earn with so much difficulty  Wife, said the man, be quiet, or I will give you a blow on your mouth  What, cried she, you threaten me, you glutton, you rascal, you lazy harry', " She was just laying hold of his hair, but long laurence got up, seized both lean lisa's withered arms in one hand, and with the other he pressed down her head into the pillow, let her scold, and held her until she fell asleep for very weariness", ' Whether she continued to wrangle when she awoke next morning, or whether she went out to look for the florin which she wanted to find, that I know not   \tBriar-Rose A long time ago there were a king and queen who said every day, ah, if only we had a child, but they never had one  But it happened that once when the queen was bathing, a frog crept out of the water on to the land, and said to her, your wish shall be fulfilled, before a year has gone by, you shall have a daughter  What the frog had said came true, and the queen had a little girl who was so pretty that the king could not contain himself for joy, and ordered a great feast  He invited not only his kindred, friends and acquaintances, but also the wise women, in order that they might be kind and well-disposed towards the child  There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but, as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out of, one of them had to be left at home  The feast was held with all manner of splendor and when it came to an end the wise women bestowed their magic gifts upon the baby - one gave virtue, another beauty, a third riches, and so on with everything in the world that one can wish for  When eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the thirteenth came in', " She wished to avenge herself for not having been invited, and without greeting, or even looking at anyone, she cried with a loud voice, the king's daughter shall in her fifteenth year prick herself with a spindle, and fall down dead", ' And, without saying a word more, she turned round and left the room  They were all shocked, but the twelfth, whose good wish still remained unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo the evil sentence, but only soften it, she said, it shall not be death, but a deep sleep of a hundred years, into which the princess shall fall  The king, who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune, gave orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be burnt  Meanwhile the gifts of the wise women were plenteously fulfilled on the young girl, for she was so beautiful, modest, good-natured, and wise, that everyone who saw her was bound to love her  It happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home, and the maiden was left in the palace quite alone  So she went round into all sorts of places, looked into rooms and bed-chambers just as she liked, and at last came to an old tower  She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase, and reached a little door  A rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there in a little room sat an old woman with a spindle, busily spinning her flax', " Good day, old mother, said the king's daughter, what are you doing there", ' I am spinning, said the old woman, and nodded her head  What sort of thing is that, that rattles round so merrily, said the girl, and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too  But scarcely had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it  And, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep  And this sleep extended over the whole palace, the king and queen who had just come home, and had entered the great hall, began to go to sleep, and the whole of the court with them  The horses, too, went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons upon the roof, the flies on the wall, even the fire that was flaming on the hearth became quiet and slept, the roast meat left off frizzling, and the cook, who was just going to pull the hair of the scullery boy, because he had forgotten something, let him go, and went to sleep  And the wind fell, and on the trees before the castle not a leaf moved again  But round about the castle there began to grow a hedge of thorns, which every year became higher, and at last grew close up round the castle and all over it, so that there was nothing of it to be seen, not even the flag upon the roof', " But the story of the beautiful sleeping briar-rose, for so the princess was named, went about the country, so that from time to time kings' sons came and tried to get through the thorny hedge into the castle", ' But they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast together, as if they had hands, and the youths were caught in them, could not get loose again, and died a miserable death', " After long, long years a king's son came again to that country, and heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge, and that a castle was said to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful princess, named briar-rose, had been asleep for a hundred years, and that the king and queen and the whole court were asleep likewise", ' He had heard, too, from his grandfather, that many kings, sons had already come, and had tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had remained sticking fast in it, and had died a pitiful death  Then the youth said, I am not afraid, I will go and see the beautiful briar-rose \tLittle Red-Cap Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child  Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else  So she was always called little red-cap  One day her mother said to her, come, little red-cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine  Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good  Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing', " And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before you do it", ' I will take great care, said little red-cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it  The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as little red-cap entered the wood, a wolf met her  Red-cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him  "Good-day, little red-cap," said he  "Thank you kindly, wolf " "Whither away so early, little red-cap?" "To my grandmother\'s " "What have you got in your apron?" "Cake and wine  Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger " "Where does your grandmother live, little red-cap?" "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood  Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below  You surely must know it," replied little red-cap  The wolf thought to himself, what a tender young creature  What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman  I must act craftily, so as to catch both  So he walked for a short time by the side of little red-cap, and then he said, "see little red-cap, how pretty the flowers are about here  Why do you not look round  I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing  You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry " Little red-cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay  That would please her too  It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time  And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers  And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood \tSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black ebony  And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow  And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame  Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony, and she was therefore called little snow-white  And when the child was born, the queen died  After a year had passed the king took to himself another wife  She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else chould surpass her in beauty  She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it, and said,      looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,      who in this land is the fairest of all  The looking-glass answered,      thou, o queen, art the fairest of all  Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth  But snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful, and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the queen herself  And once when the queen asked her looking-glass,      looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,      who in this land is the fairest of all  It answered,      thou art fairer than all who are here, lady queen       But more beautiful still is snow-white, as I ween  Then the queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy  From that hour, whenever she looked at snow-white, her heart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much  And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had no peace day or night  She called a huntsman, and said, take the child away into the forest  I will no longer have her in my sight  Kill her, and bring me back her lung and liver as a token', " The huntsman obeyed, and took her away but when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce snow-white's innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, ah dear huntsman, leave me my life", ' I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again  And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, run away, then, you poor child  The wild beasts will soon have devoured you, thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her  And as a young bear just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its lung and liver and took them to the queen as proof that the child was dead  The cook had to salt them, and the wicked queen ate them, and thought she had eaten the lung and liver of snow-white  But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at all the leaves on the trees, and did not know what to do  Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm  She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening, then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself  Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told  In a village there once lived two men who had the same name  They were both called Claus  One of them had four horses, but the other had only one; so to distinguish them, people called the owner of the four horses, "Great Claus," and he who had only one, "Little Claus " Now we shall hear what happened to them, for this is a true story  Through the whole week, Little Claus was obliged to plough for Great Claus, and lend him his one horse; and once a week, on a Sunday, Great Claus lent him all his four horses  Then how Little Claus would smack his whip over all five horses, they were as good as his own on that one day  The sun shone brightly, and the church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by, dressed in their best clothes, with their prayer-books under their arms  They were going to hear the clergyman preach  They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, "Gee-up, my five horses " "You must not say that," said Big Claus; "for only one of them belongs to you " But Little Claus soon forgot what he ought to say, and when any one passed he would call out, "Gee-up, my five horses!" "Now I must beg you not to say that again," said Big Claus; "for if you do, I shall hit your horse on the head, so that he will drop dead on the spot, and there will be an end of him " "I promise you I will not say it any more," said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him "Good day," he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, "Gee-up, all my horses!" "I\'ll gee-up your horses for you," said Big Claus; and seizing a hammer, he struck the one horse of Little Claus on the head, and he fell dead instantly  "Oh, now I have no horse at all," said Little Claus, weeping', " But after a while he took off the dead horse's skin, and hung the hide to dry in the wind", " Then he put the dry skin into a bag, and, placing it over his shoulder, went out into the next town to sell the horse's skin", ' He had a very long way to go, and had to pass through a dark, gloomy forest  Presently a storm arose, and he lost his way, and before he discovered the right path, evening came on, and it was still a long way to the town, and too far to return home before night  Near the road stood a large farmhouse  The shutters outside the windows were closed, but lights shone through the crevices at the top  "I might get permission to stay here for the night," thought Little Claus; so he went up to the door and knocked', " The farmer's wife opened the door; but when she heard what he wanted, she told him to go away, as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers", ' "Then I shall be obliged to lie out here," said Little Claus to himself, as the farmer\'s wife shut the door in his face  Near to the farmhouse stood a large haystack, and between it and the house was a small shed, with a thatched roof  "I can lie up there," said Little Claus, as he saw the roof; "it will make a famous bed, but I hope the stork will not fly down and bite my legs;" for on it stood a living stork, whose nest was in the roof  So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a splendid fish', " The farmer's wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish", ' "If I could only get some, too," thought Little Claus; and then, as he stretched his neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful pie,--indeed they had a glorious feast before them  At this moment he heard some one riding down the road, towards the farmhouse  It was the farmer returning home  He was a good man, but still he had a very strange prejudice,--he could not bear the sight of a sexton  "My poor flowers are quite dead," said little Ida, "they were so pretty yesterday evening, and now all the leaves are hanging down quite withered  What do they do that for," she asked, of the student who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he could tell the most amusing stories, and cut out the prettiest pictures; hearts, and ladies dancing, castles with doors that opened, as well as flowers; he was a delightful student  "Why do the flowers look so faded to-day?" she asked again, and pointed to her nosegay, which was quite withered  "Don\'t you know what is the matter with them?" said the student  "The flowers were at a ball last night, and therefore, it is no wonder they hang their heads " "But flowers cannot dance?" cried little Ida  "Yes indeed, they can," replied the student  "When it grows dark, and everybody is asleep, they jump about quite merrily  They have a ball almost every night " "Can children go to these balls?" "Yes," said the student, "little daisies and lilies of the valley " "Where do the beautiful flowers dance?" asked little Ida  "Have you not often seen the large castle outside the gates of the town, where the king lives in summer, and where the beautiful garden is full of flowers? And have you not fed the swans with bread when they swam towards you? Well, the flowers have capital balls there, believe me " "I was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother," said Ida, "but all the leaves were off the trees, and there was not a single flower left  Where are they? I used to see so many in the summer " "They are in the castle," replied the student  "You must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you should see how merry they are  The two most beautiful roses seat themselves on the throne, and are called the king and queen, then all the red cockscombs range themselves on each side, and bow, these are the lords-in-waiting  After that the pretty flowers come in, and there is a grand ball  The blue violets represent little naval cadets, and dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies  The tulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who sit and watch the dancing, so that everything may be conducted with order and propriety " "But," said little Ida, "is there no one there to hurt the flowers for dancing in the king\'s castle?" "No one knows anything about it," said the student  "The old steward of the castle, who has to watch there at night, sometimes comes in; but he carries a great bunch of keys, and as soon as the flowers hear the keys rattle, they run and hide themselves behind the long curtains, and stand quite still, just peeping their heads out', " Then the old steward says, 'I smell flowers here,' but he cannot see them", '" "Oh how capital," said little Ida, clapping her hands  "Should I be able to see these flowers?" "Yes," said the student, "mind you think of it the next time you go out, no doubt you will see them, if you peep through the window  I did so to-day, and I saw a long yellow lily lying stretched out on the sofa  She was a court lady " "Can the flowers from the Botanical Gardens go to these balls?" asked Ida  "It is such a distance!" "Oh yes," said the student, "whenever they like, for they can fly  Have you not seen those beautiful red, white, and yellow butterflies, that look like flowers? They were flowers once  There was once a little boy whose name was Lars, and because he was so little he was called Little Lasse; he was a brave little man, for he sailed round the world in a pea-shell boat  It was summer time, when the pea shells grew long and green in the garden  Little Lasse crept into the pea bed where the pea stalks rose high above his cap, and he picked seventeen large shells, the longest and straightest he could find  Little Lasse thought, perhaps, that no one saw him; but that was foolish, for God sees everywhere  Then the gardener came with his gun over his shoulder, and he heard something rustling in the pea bed', " 'I think that must be a sparrow,' he said", " 'Ras! Ras!' but no sparrows flew out, for Little Lasse had no wings, only two small legs", " 'Wait! I will load my gun and shoot the sparrows,' said the gardener", ' Then Little Lasse was frightened, and crept out on to the path', " 'Forgive me, dear gardener!' he said", " 'I wanted to get some fine boats", "' 'Well, I will this time,' said the gardener", " 'But another time Little Lasse must ask leave to go and look for boats in the pea bed", "' 'I will,' answered Lasse; and he went off to the shore", " Then he opened the shells with a pin, split them carefully in two, and broke small little bits of sticks for the rowers' seats", ' Then he took the peas which were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo  Some of the shells got broken, some remained whole, and when all were ready Lasse had twelve boats  But they should not be boats, they should be large warships  He had three liners, three frigates, three brigs and three schooners  The largest liner was called Hercules, and the smallest schooner The Flea  Little Lasse put all the twelve into the water, and they floated as splendidly and as proudly as any great ships over the waves of the ocean  And now the ships must sail round the world  The great island over there was Asia; that large stone Africa; the little island America; the small stones were Polynesia; and the shore from which the ships sailed out was Europe  The whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of the world  The ships of the line steered a straight course to Asia, the frigates sailed to Africa, the brigs to America, and the schooners to Polynesia  But Little Lasse remained in Europe, and threw small stones out into the great sea', " Now, there was on the shore of Europe a real boat, father's own, a beautiful white-painted boat, and Little Lasse got into it", ' Father and mother had forbidden this, but Little Lasse forgot  He thought he should very much like to travel to some other part of the world', " 'I shall row out a little way--only a very little way,' he thought" ,  ' Once upon a time there were two brothers, peasants, and one was kind and the other was cunning  And the cunning one made money and became rich--very rich--so rich that he thought himself far too good for the village  He went off to the town, and dressed in fine furs, and clothed his wife in rich brocades, and made friends among the merchants, and began to live as merchants live, eating all day long, no longer like a simple peasant who eats kasha one day, kasha the next day, and for a change kasha on the third day also  And always he grew richer and richer  It was very different with the kind one  He lent money to a neighbour, and the neighbour never paid it back  He sowed before the last frost, and lost all his crops  His horse went lame  His cow gave no milk  If his hens laid eggs, they were stolen; and if he set a night-line in the river, some one else always pulled it out and stole the fish and the hooks  Everything went wrong with him, and each day saw him poorer than the day before  At last there came a time when he had not a crumb of bread in the house  He and his wife were thin as sticks because they had nothing to eat, and the children were crying all day long because of their little empty stomachs  From morning till night he dug and worked, struggling against poverty like a fish against the ice; but it was no good  Things went from bad to worse  At last his wife said to him: "You must go to the town and see that rich brother of yours  He will surely not refuse to give you a little help " And he said: "Truly, wife, there is nothing else to be done  I will go to the town, and perhaps my rich brother will help me  I am sure he would not let my children starve  After all, he is their uncle " So he took his stick and tramped off to the town  He came to the house of his rich brother  A fine house it was, with painted eaves and a doorway carved by a master  Many servants were there and food in plenty, and people coming and going  He went in and found his brother, and said,-- "Dear brother of mine, I beg you help me, even if only a little  My wife and children are without bread  All day long they sit hungry and waiting, and I have no food to give them " The rich brother looks at him, and hums and strokes his beard  Then says he: "I will help you  Once upon a time there was a Woman, who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was named One-Eye, because she had but a single eye, and that placed in the middle of her forehead; the second was called Two-Eyes, because she was like other mortals; and the third, Three-Eyes, because she had three eyes, and one of them in the centre of her forehead, like her eldest sister  But, because her second sister had nothing out of the common in her appearance, she was looked down upon by her sisters, and despised by her mother  "You are no better than common folk," they would say to her; "you do not belong to us"; and then they would push her about, give her coarse clothing, and nothing to eat but their leavings, besides numerous other insults as occasion offered  Once it happened that Two-Eyes had to go into the forest to tend the goat; and she went very hungry, because her sisters had given her very little to eat that morning  She sat down upon a hillock, and cried so much that her tears flowed almost like rivers out of her eyes! By and by she looked up and saw a Woman standing by, who asked, "Why are you weeping, Two-Eyes?" "Because I have two eyes like ordinary people," replied the maiden, "and therefore my mother and sisters dislike me, push me into corners, throw me their old clothes, and give me nothing to eat but what they leave  To-day they have given me so little that I am still hungry " "Dry your eyes, then, now," said the wise Woman; "I will tell you something which shall prevent you from being hungry again  You must say to your goat:  "\'Little kid, milk  Table, appear!\' "and immediately a nicely filled table will stand before you, with delicate food upon it, of which you can eat as much as you please  And when you are satisfied, and have done with the table, you must say:  \'Little kid, milk  Table, depart!\' "and it will disappear directly " With these words the wise Woman went away, and little Two-Eyes thought to herself she would try at once if what the Woman said were true, for she felt very hungry indeed   "Little kid, milk  Table, appear!" said the maiden, and immediately a table covered with a white cloth stood before her, with a knife and fork, and silver spoon; and the most delicate dishes were ranged in order upon it, and everything as warm as if they had been just taken away from the fire  Two-Eyes said a short grace, and then began to eat; and when she had finished she pronounced the words which the wise Woman had told her:  "Little kid, milk  Table, depart!" and directly the table and all that was on it quickly disappeared  "This is capital housekeeping," said the maiden, in high glee; and at evening she went home with her goat, and found an earthen dish which her sisters had left her filled with their leavings  She did not touch it; and the next morning she went off again without taking the meagre breakfast which was left out for her  The first and second time she did this the sisters thought nothing of it; but when she did the same the third morning their attention was roused, and they said, "All is not right with Two-Eyes, for she has left her meals twice, and has touched nothing of what was left for her; she must have found some other way of living " So they determined that One-Eye should go with the maiden when she drove the goat to the meadow and pay attention to what passed, and observe whether any one brought her to eat or to drink  When Two-Eyes, therefore, was about to set off, One-Eye told her she was going with her to see whether she took proper care of the goat and fed her sufficiently  Two-Eyes, however, divined her sister\'s object, and drove the goat where the grass was finest, and then said, "Come, One-Eye, let us sit down, and I will sing to you " So One-Eye sat down, for she was quite tired with her unusual walk and the heat of the sun   "Are you awake or asleep, One-Eye?  Are you awake or asleep?" sang Two-Eyes, until her sister really went to sleep  As soon as she was quite sound, the maiden had her table out, and ate and drank all she needed; and by the time One-Eye woke again the table had disappeared, and the maiden said to her sister, "Come, we will go home now; while you have been sleeping the goat might have run about all over the world " So they went home, and after Two-Eyes had left her meal untouched, the mother inquired of One-Eye what she had seen, and she was obliged to confess that she had been asleep  The following morning the mother told Three-Eyes that she must go out and watch Two-Eyes, and see who brought her food, for it was certain that some one must  So Three-Eyes told her sister that she was going to accompany her that morning to see if she took care of the goat and fed her well; but Two-Eyes saw through her design, and drove the goat again to the best feeding-place  Then she asked her sister to sit down and she would sing to her, and Three-Eyes did so, for she was very tired with her long walk in the heat of the sun  Then Two-Eyes began to sing as before:  "Are you awake, Three-Eyes?" but, instead of continuing as she should have done,  "Are you asleep, Three-Eyes?" she said by mistake,  "Are you asleep, Two-Eyes?" and so went on singing:  "Are you awake, Three-Eyes?"  "Are you asleep, Two-Eyes?" By and by Three-Eyes closed two of her eyes, and went to sleep with them; but the third eye, which was not spoken to, kept open  Three-Eyes, however, cunningly shut it too, and feigned to be asleep, while she was really watching; and soon Two-Eyes, thinking all safe, repeated the words:  "Little kid, milk  Table, appear!" and as soon as she was satisfied she said the old words:  "Little kid, milk  Table, depart!" Three-Eyes watched all these proceedings; and presently Two-Eyes came and awoke her, saying, "Ah, sister! you are a good watcher, but come, let us go home now " When they reached home Two-Eyes again ate nothing; and her sister told her mother she knew now why the haughty hussy would not eat their victuals  "When she is out in the meadow," said her sister, "she says:  "\'Little kid, milk  Table, appear!\' "and, directly, a table comes up laid out with meat and wine, and everything of the best, much better than we have; and as soon as she has had enough she says:  "\'Little kid, milk  Table, depart!\' "and all goes away directly, as I clearly saw  Certainly she did put to sleep two of my eyes, but the one in the middle of my forehead luckily kept awake!" "Will you have better things than we?" cried the envious mother; "then you shall lose the chance"; and so saying, she took a carving-knife and killed the goat dead  Many years ago there lived a dear little girl who was beloved by every one who knew her; but her grand-mother was so very fond of her that she never felt she could think and do enough to please this dear grand-daughter, and she presented the little girl with a red silk cap, which suited her so well, that she would never wear anything else, and so was called Little Red-Cap  One day Red-Cap\'s mother said to her, "Come, Red-Cap, here is a nice piece of meat, and a bottle of wine: take these to your grandmother; she is weak and ailing, and they will do her good  Be there before she gets up; go quietly and carefully " The grandmother lived far away in the wood, a long walk from the village, and as Little Red-Cap came among the trees she met a Wolf; but she did not know what a wicked animal it was, and so she was not at all frightened  "Good morning, Little Red-Cap," he said  "Thank you, Mr  Wolf," said she  "Where are you going so early, Little Red-Cap?" "To my grandmother\'s," she answered  "And what are you carrying in that basket?" "Some wine and meat," she replied  "We baked the meat yesterday, so that grandmother, who is very weak, might have a nice strengthening meal " "And where does your grandmother live?" asked the Wolf  "Oh, quite twenty minutes walk further in the forest  The cottage stands under three great oak trees; and close by are some nut bushes, by which you will at once know it " The Wolf was thinking to himself, "She is a nice tender thing, and will taste better than the old woman; I must act cleverly, that I may make a meal of both " Presently he came up again to Little Red-Cap, and said, "Just look at the beautiful flowers which grow around you; why do you not look about you? I believe you don\'t hear how sweetly the birds are singing  You walk as if you were going to school; see how cheerful everything is about you in the forest " And Little Red-Cap opened her eyes; and when she saw how the sunbeams glanced and danced through the trees, and what bright flowers were blooming in her path, she thought, "If I take my grandmother a fresh nosegay, she will be very much pleased; and it is so very early that I can, even then, get there in good time;" and running into the forest, she looked about for flowers  But when she had once begun she did not know how to leave off, and kept going deeper and deeper amongst the trees looking for some still more beautiful flower  The Wolf, however, ran straight to the house of the old grandmother, and knocked at the door  "Who\'s there?" asked the old lady  "Only Little Red-Cap, bringing you some meat and wine; please open the door," answered the Wolf  "Lift up the latch," cried the grandmother; "I am much too ill to get up myself " So the Wolf lifted the latch, and the door flew open; and without a word, he jumped on to the bed, and gobbled up the poor old lady  Then he put on her clothes, and tied her night-cap over his head; got into the bed, and drew the blankets over him  All this time Red-Cap was gathering flowers; and when she had picked as many as she could carry, she thought of her grandmother, and hurried to the cottage  She wondered greatly to find the door open; and when she got into the room, she began to feel very ill, and exclaimed, "How sad I feel! I wish I had not come to-day " Then she said, "Good morning," but received no reply; so she went up to the bed, and drew back the curtains, and there lay her grandmother, as she imagined, with the cap drawn half over her eyes, and looking very fierce  "Oh, grandmother, what great ears you have!" she said  "All the better to hear you with," was the reply  "And what great eyes you have!" "All the better to see you with  Once upon a time, there lived in a certain village, a little country girl, the prettiest creature was ever seen  Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grand-mother doated on her much more  This good woman got made for her a little red riding-hood; which became the girl so extremely well, that every body called her Little Red Riding-Hood  One day, her mother, having made some girdle-cakes, said to her: "Go, my dear, and see how thy grand-mamma does, for I hear she has been very ill, carry her a girdle-cake, and this little pot of butter " Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grand-mother, who lived in another village', " As she was going thro' the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he durst not, because of some faggot-makers hard by in the forest", ' He asked her whither she was going  The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear a Wolf talk, said to him: "I am going to see my grand-mamma, and carry her a girdle-cake, and a little pot of butter, from my mamma " "Does she live far off?" said the Wolf  "Oh! ay," answered Little Red Riding-Hood, "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village " "Well," said the Wolf, "and I\'ll go and see her too: I\'ll go this way, and you go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest " The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way; and the little girl went by that farthest about, diverting herself in gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such little flowers as she met with', " The Wolf was not long before he got to the old woman's house: he knocked at the door, _tap, tap_", ' "Who\'s there?" "Your grand-child, Little Red Riding-Hood," replied the Wolf, counterfeiting her voice, "who has brought you a girdle-cake, and a little pot of butter, sent you by mamma " The good grand-mother, who was in bed, because she found herself somewhat ill, cry\'d out: "Pull the peg, and the bolt will fall " The Wolf pull\'d the peg, and the door opened, and then presently he fell upon the good woman, and ate her up in a moment; for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit', " He then shut the door, and went into the grand-mother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some time afterwards, and knock'd at the door, _tap, tap_", ' "Who\'s there?" Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grand-mother had got a cold, and was hoarse, answered: "\'Tis your grand-child, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you a girdle-cake, and a little pot of butter, mamma sends you " The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the peg, and the bolt will fall " Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the peg, and the door opened  The Wolf seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes: "Put the cake, and the little pot of butter upon the bread-bin, and come and lye down with me " Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself, and went into bed; where, being greatly amazed to see how her grand-mother looked in her night-cloaths, she said to her: "Grand-mamma, what great arms you have got!" "That is the better to hug thee, my dear " "Grand-mamma, what great legs you have got!" "That is to run the better, my child " "Grand-mamma, what great ears you have got!" "That is to hear the better, my child " "Grand-mamma, what great eyes you have got!" "It is to see the better, my child " "Grand-mamma, what great teeth you have got!" "That is to eat thee up " And, saying these words, this wicked Wolf fell upon poor Little Red Riding-Hood, and ate her all up    The coach drove on through a thick forest, where it lighted up the way like a torch, and dazzled the eyes of some robbers, who could not bear to let it pass them unmolested  "It is gold! it is gold!" cried they, rushing forward, and seizing the horses  Then they struck the little jockeys, the coachman, and the footman dead, and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage  "She is fat and pretty, and she has been fed with the kernels of nuts," said the old robber-woman, who had a long beard and eyebrows that hung over her eyes  "She is as good as a little lamb; how nice she will taste!" and as she said this, she drew forth a shining knife, that glittered horribly  "Oh!" screamed the old woman the same moment; for her own daughter, who held her back, had bitten her in the ear  She was a wild and naughty girl, and the mother called her an ugly thing, and had not time to kill Gerda  "She shall play with me," said the little robber-girl; "she shall give me her muff and her pretty dress, and sleep with me in my bed " And then she bit her mother again, and made her spring in the air, and jump about; and all the robbers laughed, and said, "See how she is dancing with her young cub " "I will have a ride in the coach," said the little robber-girl; and she would have her own way; for she was so self-willed and obstinate  She and Gerda seated themselves in the coach, and drove away, over stumps and stones, into the depths of the forest  The little robber-girl was about the same size as Gerda, but stronger; she had broader shoulders and a darker skin; her eyes were quite black, and she had a mournful look  She clasped little Gerda round the waist, and said,-- "They shall not kill you as long as you don\'t make us vexed with you  I suppose you are a princess " "No," said Gerda; and then she told her all her history, and how fond she was of little Kay  The robber-girl looked earnestly at her, nodded her head slightly, and said, "They sha\'nt kill you, even if I do get angry with you; for I will do it myself " And then she wiped Gerda\'s eyes, and stuck her own hands in the beautiful muff which was so soft and warm', " The coach stopped in the courtyard of a robber's castle, the walls of which were cracked from top to bottom", ' Ravens and crows flew in and out of the holes and crevices, while great bulldogs, either of which looked as if it could swallow a man, were jumping about; but they were not allowed to bark  In the large and smoky hall a bright fire was burning on the stone floor  There was no chimney; so the smoke went up to the ceiling, and found a way out for itself  Soup was boiling in a large cauldron, and hares and rabbits were roasting on the spit  "You shall sleep with me and all my little animals to-night," said the robber-girl, after they had had something to eat and drink  So she took Gerda to a corner of the hall, where some straw and carpets were laid down  Above them, on laths and perches, were more than a hundred pigeons, who all seemed to be asleep, although they moved slightly when the two little girls came near them  "These all belong to me," said the robber-girl; and she seized the nearest to her, held it by the feet, and shook it till it flapped its wings  "Kiss it," cried she, flapping it in Gerda\'s face  "There sit the wood-pigeons," continued she, pointing to a number of laths and a cage which had been fixed into the walls, near one of the openings  "Both rascals would fly away directly, if they were not closely locked up  And here is my old sweetheart \'Ba;\'" and she dragged out a reindeer by the horn; he wore a bright copper ring round his neck, and was tied up  It was in the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that a certain queen sat working at her window, the frame of which was made of fine black ebony; and, as she was looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it  Then she gazed thoughtfully down on the red drops which sprinkled the white snow and said, "Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as the blood, and as black as the ebony window-frame!" And so the little girl grew up; her skin was a white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snow-White  But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who was very beautiful, but so proud that she could not bear to think that any one could surpass her  She had a magical looking-glass, to which she used to go and gaze upon herself in it, and say--  "Tell me, glass, tell me true!   Of all the ladies in the land,  Who is fairest? tell me who?" And the glass answered, "Thou, Queen, art fairest in the land" But Snow-White grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old, she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself  Then the glass one day answered queen, when she went to consult it as usual--  "Thou, Queen, may\'st fair and beauteous be,  But Snow-White is lovelier far than thee?" When the queen heard this she turned pale with rage and envy; and calling to one of her servants said, "Take Snow-White away into the wide wood, that I may never see her more " Then the servant led the little girl away; but his heart melted when she begged him to spare her life, and he said, "I will not hurt thee, thou pretty child " So he left her there alone; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her to pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her, but leave her to her fate  Then poor Snow-White wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared around, but none did her any harm  In the evening she came to a little cottage, and went in there to rest, for her weary feet would carry her no further  Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates with seven little loaves and seven little glasses with wine in them; and knives and forks laid in order, and by the wall stood seven little beds  Then, as she was exceedingly hungry, she picked a little piece off each loaf, and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest  So she tried all the little beds; and one was too long, and another was too short, till, at last, the seventh suited her; and there she laid herself down and went to sleep  Presently in came the masters of the cottage, who were seven little dwarfs that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched about for gold  They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw directly that all was not right  The first said, "Who has been sitting on my stool?" The second, "Who has been eating off my plate?" The third, "Who has been picking at my bread?" The fourth, "Who has been meddling with my spoon?" The fifth, "Who has been handling my fork?" The sixth, "Who has been cutting with my knife?" The seventh, "Who has been drinking my wine?" Then the first looked around and said, "Who has been lying on my bed?" And the rest came running to him, and every one cried out that somebody had been upon his bed  But the seventh saw Snow-White, and called upon his brethren to come and look at her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment, and brought their lamps and gazing upon her, they said, "Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!" And they were delighted to see her, and took care not to waken her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone  In the morning Snow-White told them all her story, and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash, and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her  Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains; and Snow-White remained at home; and they warned her, saying, "The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in " But the queen, now that she thought Snow-White was dead, believed that she was certainly the handsomest lady in the land; so she went to her glass and said--  "Tell me, glass, tell me true!   Of all the ladies in the land,  Who is fairest? tell me who?" And the glass answered--  "Thou, Queen, thou are fairest in all this land;  But over the Hills, in the greenwood shade,  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,  There Snow-White is hiding; and she  Is lovelier far, O Queen, than thee " Then the queen was very much alarmed; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and she was sure that the servant had betrayed her  And as she could not bear to think that any one lived who was more beautiful than she was, she disguised herself as an old pedlar woman and went her way over the hills to the place where the dwarfs dwelt  Then she knocked at the door and cried, "Fine wares to sell!" Snow-White looked out of the window, and said, "Good day, good woman; what have you to sell?" "Good wares, fine wares," replied she; "laces and bobbins of all colors " "I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of a body," thought Snow-White; so she ran down, and unbolted the door  "Bless me!" said the woman, "how badly your stays are laced  Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces " Snow-White did not dream of any mischief; so she stood up before the old woman who set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tightly that Snow-White lost her breath, and fell down as if she were dead  "There\'s an end of all thy beauty," said the spiteful queen, and went away home  In the evening the seven dwarfs returned; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snow-White stretched upon the ground motionless, as if she were quite dead  However, they lifted her up, and when they found what was the matter, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and soon came to herself again  Then they said, "The old woman was the queen; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away  There was, once upon a time, a man and his wife, faggot-makers by trade, who had seven children, all boys  The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest only seven  One might wonder how that the faggot-maker could have so many children in so little a time; but it was because his wife went nimbly about her business and never brought fewer than two at a birth  They were very poor, and their seven children incommoded them greatly, because not one of them was able to earn his bread  That which gave them yet more uneasiness was, that the youngest was of a very puny constitution, and scarce ever spake a word, which made them take that for stupidity which was a sign of good sense', " He was very little, and, when born, no bigger than one's thumb; which made him be called Little Thumb", ' The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house, and guilty or not was always in the wrong; he was, notwithstanding, more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together, and if he spake little he heard and thought the more  There happened now to come a very bad year, and the famine was so great, that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children  One evening, when they were all in bed and the faggot-maker was sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with grief: "Thou see\'st plainly that we are not able to keep our children, and I cannot see them starve to death before my face; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to-morrow, which may very easily be done; for while they are busy in tying up the faggots, we may run away, and leave them, without their taking any notice " "Ah!" cried out his wife, "and can\'st thou thyself have the heart to take thy children out along with thee on purpose to lose them?" In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty; she would not consent to it; she was, indeed poor, but she was their mother  However, having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger, she at last consented and went to bed all in tears', " Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken; for observing, as he lay in his bed, that they were talking very busily, he had got up softly and hid himself under his father's stool, that he might hear what they said, without being seen", ' He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking on what he ought to do  He got up early in the morning, and went to the river side, where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, and then returned home  They all went abroad, but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew  They went into a very thick forest, where they could not see one another at ten paces distance  The faggot-maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather up sticks to make faggots', " Their father and mother seeing them busy at their work, got from them by degrees, and then ran away from them all at once, along a by-way, thro' the winding bushes", ' When the children saw they were left alone, they began to cry as loud as they could  Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to go home again; for as he came he had taken care to drop all along the way the little white pebbles he had in his pockets  Then said he to them: "Be not afraid, brothers, father and mother have left us here, but I will lead you home again, only follow me " They did so, and he brought them home by the very same way they came into the forest  They dared not to go in, but sat themselves down at the door, listening to what their father and mother were saying  The very moment the faggot-maker and his wife were got home, the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had owed them a long while, and which they never expected  This gave them new life; for the poor people were almost famished', " The faggot-maker sent his wife immediately to the butcher's", ' As it was a long while since they had eaten a bit, she bought thrice as much meat as would sup two people  Having filled their bellies, the woman said: "Alas! where are now our poor children? They would make a good feast of what we have left here; but then it was you, William, who had a mind to lose them; I told you we should repent of it: what are they now doing in the forest? Alas! dear God, the wolves have, perhaps, already eaten them up: thou art very inhuman thus to have lost thy children " The faggot-maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeated this above twenty times, that they should repent of it, and she was in the right of it for so saying  He threatened to beat her, if she did not hold her tongue  There was once a woman who wished very much to have a little child, but she could not obtain her wish  At last she went to a fairy, and said, "I should so very much like to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?" "Oh, that can be easily managed," said the fairy  "Here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer\'s fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen " "Thank you," said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn  Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud  "It is a beautiful flower," said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip  Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden  She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of "Thumbelina," or Tiny, because she was so small  A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane  Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water  Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat  Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair  It really was a very pretty sight  Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard  One night, while she lay in her pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken pane of glass in the window, and leaped right upon the table where Tiny lay sleeping under her rose-leaf quilt  "What a pretty little wife this would make for my son," said the toad, and she took up the walnut-shell in which little Tiny lay asleep, and jumped through the window with it into the garden  In the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived the toad, with her son  He was uglier even than his mother, and when he saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he could only cry, "Croak, croak, croak " "Don\'t speak so loud, or she will wake," said the toad, "and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan\'s down  We will place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream; it will be like an island to her, she is so light and small, and then she cannot escape; and, while she is away, we will make haste and prepare the state-room under the marsh, in which you are to live when you are married " Far out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies, with broad green leaves, which seemed to float on the top of the water  The largest of these leaves appeared farther off than the rest, and the old toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell, in which little Tiny lay still asleep  The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land  Meanwhile the old toad was very busy under the marsh, decking her room with rushes and wild yellow flowers, to make it look pretty for her new daughter-in-law  Then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed poor little Tiny  She wanted to fetch the pretty bed, that she might put it in the bridal chamber to be ready for her  The old toad bowed low to her in the water, and said, "Here is my son, he will be your husband, and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream " "Croak, croak, croak," was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept  She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband  The little fishes, who swam about in the water beneath, had seen the toad, and heard what she said, so they lifted their heads above the water to look at the little maiden  Yes, they called him Little Tuk, but it was not his real name; he had called himself so before he could speak plainly, and he meant it for Charles  It was all very well for those who knew him, but not for strangers  Little Tuk was left at home to take care of his little sister, Gustava, who was much younger than himself, and he had to learn his lessons at the same time, and the two things could not very well be performed together  The poor boy sat there with his sister on his lap, and sung to her all the songs he knew, and now and then he looked into his geography lesson that lay open before him  By the next morning he had to learn by heart all the towns in Zealand, and all that could be described of them  His mother came home at last, and took little Gustava in her arms  Then Tuk ran to the window, and read so eagerly that he nearly read his eyes out; for it had become darker and darker every minute, and his mother had no money to buy a light  "There goes the old washerwoman up the lane," said the mother, as she looked out of the window; "the poor woman can hardly drag herself along, and now she had to drag a pail of water from the well  Be a good boy, Tuk, and run across and help the old woman, won\'t you?" So Tuk ran across quickly, and helped her, but when he came back into the room it was quite dark, and there was not a word said about a light, so he was obliged to go to bed on his little truckle bedstead, and there he lay and thought of his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and of all the master had told him  He ought really to have read it over again, but he could not for want of light  So he put the geography book under his pillow, for he had heard that this was a great help towards learning a lesson, but not always to be depended upon  He still lay thinking and thinking, when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth  He slept and yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said, "It would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow morning; you helped me, and now I will help you, and Providence will always keep those who help themselves;" and at the same time the book under Tuk\'s pillow began to move about  "Cluck, cluck, cluck," cried a hen as she crept towards him  "I am a hen from Kjoge," and then she told him how many inhabitants the town contained, and about a battle that had been fought there, which really was not worth speaking of  "Crack, crack," down fell something  It was a wooden bird, the parrot which is used as a target as Prastoe  He said there were as many inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body  He was very proud, and said, "Thorwalsden lived close to me, and here I am now, quite comfortable " But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment he found himself on horseback  Gallop, gallop, away he went, seated in front of a richly-attired knight, with a waving plume, who held him on the saddle, and so they rode through the wood by the old town of Wordingburg, which was very large and busy', " The king's castle was surrounded by lofty towers, and radiant light streamed from all the windows", ' Within there were songs and dancing; King Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together', " Morning dawned, and as the sun rose, the whole city and the king's castle sank suddenly down together", ' One tower after another fell, till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been  The town now appeared small and poor, and the school-boys read in their books, which they carried under their arms, that it contained two thousand inhabitants; but this was a mere boast, for it did not contain so many  And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing whether he was dreaming or not, for some one stood by him  "Tuk! little Tuk!" said a voice  It was a very little person who spoke  He was dressed as a sailor, and looked small enough to be a middy, but he was not one  Once upon a time the things in this story happened, and if they had not happened then the story would never have been told  But that was the time when wolves and lambs lay peacefully together in one stall, and shepherds dined on grassy banks with kings and queens  Once upon a time, then, my dear good children, there lived a man  Now this man was really a hundred years old, if not fully twenty years more  And his wife was very old too--how old I do not know; but some said she was as old as the goddess Venus herself  They had been very happy all these years, but they would have been happier still if they had had any children; but old though they were they had never made up their minds to do without them, and often they would sit over the fire and talk of how they would have brought up their children if only some had come to their house', " One day the old man seemed sadder and more thoughtful than was common with him, and at last he said to his wife: 'Listen to me, old woman!' 'What do you want?' asked she", " 'Get me some money out of the chest, for I am going a long journey--all through the world--to see if I cannot find a child, for my heart aches to think that after I am dead my house will fall into the hands of a stranger", ' And this let me tell you: that if I never find a child I shall not come home again', "' Then the old man took a bag and filled it with food and money, and throwing it over his shoulders, bade his wife farewell", ' For long he wandered, and wandered, and wandered, but no child did he see; and one morning his wanderings led him to a forest which was so thick with trees that no light could pass through the branches', " The old man stopped when he saw this dreadful place, and at first was afraid to go in; but he remembered that, after all, as the proverb says: 'It is the unexpected that happens,' and perhaps in the midst of this black spot he might find the child he was seeking", ' So summoning up all his courage he plunged boldly in  How long he might have been walking there he never could have told you, when at last he reached the mouth of a cave where the darkness seemed a hundred times darker than the wood itself  Again he paused, but he felt as if something was driving him to enter, and with a beating heart he stepped in  For some minutes the silence and darkness so appalled him that he stood where he was, not daring to advance one step  Then he made a great effort and went on a few paces, and suddenly, far before him, he saw the glimmer of a light  This put new heart into him, and he directed his steps straight towards the faint rays, till he could see, sitting by it, an old hermit, with a long white beard  The hermit either did not hear the approach of his visitor, or pretended not to do so, for he took no notice, and continued to read his book', " After waiting patiently for a little while, the old man fell on his knees, and said: 'Good morning, holy father!' But he might as well have spoken to the rock", " 'Good morning, holy father,' he said again, a little louder than before, and this time the hermit made a sign to him to come nearer", " 'My son,' whispered he, in a voice that echoed through the cavern, 'what brings you to this dark and dismal place? Hundreds of years have passed since my eyes have rested on the face of a man, and I did not think to look on one again", "'", " 'My misery has brought me here,' replied the old man; 'I have no child, and all our lives my wife and I have longed for one", ' So I left my home, and went out into the world, hoping that somewhere I might find what I was seeking', "' Then the hermit picked up an apple from the ground, and gave it to him, saying: 'Eat half of this apple, and give the rest to your wife, and cease wandering through the world", "' The old man stooped and kissed the feet of the hermit for sheer joy, and left the cave", ' He made his way through the forest as fast as the darkness would let him, and at length arrived in flowery fields, which dazzled him with their brightness  Suddenly he was seized with a desperate thirst, and a burning in his throat  He looked for a stream but none was to be seen, and his tongue grew more parched every moment' ,  " There was once a king's son who told his father that he wished to marry", " 'No, no!' said the king; 'you must not be in such a hurry", ' Wait till you have done some great deed  My father did not let me marry till I had won the golden sword you see me wear', "' The prince was much disappointed, but he never dreamed of disobeying his father, and he began to think with all his might what he could do", ' It was no use staying at home, so one day he wandered out into the world to try his luck, and as he walked along he came to a little hut in which he found an old woman crouching over the fire', " 'Good evening, mother", " I see you have lived long in this world; do you know anything about the three bulrushes?' 'Yes, indeed, I've lived long and been much about in the world, but I have never seen or heard anything of what you ask", ' Still, if you will wait till to-morrow I may be able to tell you something', "' Well, he waited till the morning, and quite early the old woman appeared and took out a little pipe and blew in it, and in a moment all the crows in the world were flying about her", ' Not one was missing  Then she asked if they knew anything about the three bulrushes, but not one of them did  The prince went on his way, and a little further on he found another hut in which lived an old man  On being questioned the old man said he knew nothing, but begged the prince to stay overnight, and the next morning the old man called all the ravens together, but they too had nothing to tell  The prince bade him farewell and set out  He wandered so far that he crossed seven kingdoms, and at last, one evening, he came to a little house in which was an old woman', " 'Good evening, dear mother,' said he politely", " 'Good evening to you, my dear son,' answered the old woman", " 'It is lucky for you that you spoke to me or you would have met with a horrible death", " But may I ask where are you going?' 'I am seeking the three bulrushes", " Do you know anything about them?' 'I don't know anything myself, but wait till to-morrow", ' Perhaps I can tell you then', "' So the next morning she blew on her pipe, and lo! and behold every magpie in the world flew up", ' That is to say, all the magpies except one who had broken a leg and a wing  The old woman sent after it at once, and when she questioned the magpies the crippled one was the only one who knew where the three bulrushes were  Then the prince started off with the lame magpie  They went on and on till they reached a great stone wall, many, many feet high', " 'Now, prince,' said the magpie, 'the three bulrushes are behind that wall", "' The prince wasted no time", ' He set his horse at the wall and leaped over it  Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses  He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin', " This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees", ' They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them  King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write  One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, "Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt " His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds  The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair', " One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her", " When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story", ' From that time she began repeating, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun," and would say nothing else  Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun " Her father used to get quite vexed with her  "Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?" he would say  "He is the man I am to marry," said Laili  "Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun " And she was half mad  Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them  All the time she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun " The prince heard her, and turned round  "Who is calling me?" he asked  At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, "I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry " And she went home to her father and said, "Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry " "Very well, you shall have him for your husband," said Munsuk Raja  "We will ask him to-morrow " Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient  As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad  She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country  All the time she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;" and so she wandered about for twelve years  At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir--he was really an angel, but she did not know this--who asked her, "Why do you always say, \'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun\'?" She answered, "I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is  Once upon a time there was a king who had an only son  When the lad was about eighteen years old his father had to go to fight in a war against a neighbouring country, and the king led his troops in person  He bade his son act as Regent in his absence, but ordered him on no account to marry till his return  Time went by  The prince ruled the country and never even thought of marrying  But when he reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to think that it might be rather nice to have a wife, and he thought so much that at last he got quite eager about it  He remembered, however, what his father had said, and waited some time longer, till at last it was ten years since the king went out to war  Then the prince called his courtiers about him and set off with a great retinue to seek a bride', " He hardly knew which way to go, so he wandered about for twenty days, when, suddenly, he found himself in his father's camp", " The king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions to ask and answer; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting for him at home the prince was starting off to seek a wife he was very angry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave any of my people with you", "' Only one faithful servant stayed with the prince and refused to part from him", ' They journeyed over hill and dale till they came to a place called Goldtown  The King of Goldtown had a lovely daughter, and the prince, who soon heard about her beauty, could not rest till he saw her  He was very kindly received, for he was extremely good-looking and had charming manners, so he lost no time in asking for her hand and her parents gave her to him with joy  The wedding took place at once, and the feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month  At the end of the month they set off for home, but as the journey was a long one they spent the first evening at an inn  Everyone in the house slept, and only the faithful servant kept watch  About midnight he heard three crows, who had flown to the roof, talking together', " 'That's a handsome couple which arrived here tonight", ' It seems quite a pity they should lose their lives so soon', "' 'Truly,' said the second crow; 'for to-morrow, when midday strikes, the bridge over the Gold Stream will break just as they are driving over it", ' But, listen! whoever overhears and tells what we have said will be turned to stone up to his knees', "' The crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew", ' And close upon them followed three pigeons', " 'Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will perish,' said they; 'for the king is going to send a carriage to meet them which looks as new as paint", ' But when they are seated in it a raging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds  Then it will fall suddenly to earth, and they will be killed  But anyone who hears and betrays what we have said will be turned to stone up to his waist', "' With that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and this is what they said: 'If the young couple does manage to escape the dangers of the bridge and the carriage, the king means to send them each a splendid gold embroidered robe", ' When they put these on they will be burnt up at once There was once a king who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty king, she was called maid maleen, and was very beautiful  As her father wished to give her to another, the prince was rejected, but as they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and maid maleen said to her father, I can and will take no other for my husband  Then the king flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter  When it was finished, he said, therein shall you be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if your perverse spirit is broken  Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower, and then she and her maid-in-waiting were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth  There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began', " The king's son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls", ' What else could they do but lament and complain  Meanwhile the time passed, and by the decline of food and drink they knew that the seven years were coming to an end  They thought the moment of their deliverance was come, but no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to maid maleen that her father had forgotten her  As they had food only for a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, maid maleen said, we must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall  She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn  With great labor they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second, and a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out  The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces, but how melancholy everything looked all around', " Her father's castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible", ' When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then maid maleen followed  But where were they to go  The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the king, and slain all the inhabitants  They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettles  When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere, but wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them  At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace  There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions  The son of the king in whose kingdom they were, however, was the very man who had been betrothed to maid maleen  His father had chosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked  The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already arrived, but because of her great ugliness she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and maid maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen  When the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people  Then said she to maid maleen, a great piece of luck has befallen you  I have sprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets, you shall put on wedding-clothes and take my place, a greater honor than that you cannot have  Maid maleen, however, refused it, and said, I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me  It was in vain, too, that the bride offered her gold  Once, upon a time there was a man and his wife who had two children, a boy and a girl  The wife died, and the man married again  His new wife had an only daughter, who was both ugly and untidy, whereas her stepdaughter was a beautiful girl, and was known as Maiden Bright-eye  Her stepmother was very cruel to her on this account; she had always to do the hardest work, and got very little to eat, and no attention paid to her; but to her own daughter she was all that was good  She was spared from all the hardest of the housework, and had always the prettiest clothes to wear  Maiden Bright-eye had also to watch the sheep, but of course it would never do to let her go idle and enjoy herself too much at this work, so she had to pull heather while she was out on the moors with them  Her stepmother gave her pancakes to take with her for her dinner, but she had mixed the flour with ashes, and made them just as bad as she could', " The little girl came out on the moor and began to pull heather on the side of a little mound, but next minute a little fellow with a red cap on his head popped up out of the mound and said: 'Who's that pulling the roof off my house?' 'Oh, it's me, a poor little girl,' said she; 'my mother sent me out here, and told me to pull heather", ' If you will be good to me I will give you a bit of my dinner', "' The little fellow was quite willing, and she gave him the biggest share of her pancakes", ' They were not particularly good, but when one is hungry anything tastes well', " After he had got them all eaten he said to her: 'Now, I shall give you three wishes, for you are a very nice little girl; but I will choose the wishes for you", ' You are beautiful, and much more beautiful shall you be; yes, so lovely that there will not be your like in the world  The next wish shall be that every time you open your mouth a gold coin shall fall out of it, and your voice shall be like the most beautiful music  The third wish shall be that you may be married to the young king, and become the queen of the country  At the same time I shall give you a cap, which you must carefully keep, for it can save you, if you ever are in danger of your life, if you just put it on your head  Maiden Bright-eye thanked the little bergman ever so often, and drove home her sheep in the evening  By that time she had grown so beautiful that her people could scarcely recognise her  Her stepmother asked her how it had come about that she had grown so beautiful  She told the whole story--for she always told the truth--that a little man had come to her out on the moor and had given her all this beauty  She did not tell, however, that she had given him a share of her dinner', " The stepmother thought to herself, 'If one can become so beautiful by going out there, my own daughter shall also be sent, for she can well stand being made a little prettier", "' Next morning she baked for her the finest cakes, and dressed her prettily to go out with the sheep", ' But she was afraid to go away there without having a stick to defend herself with if anything should come near her', " She was not very much inclined for pulling the heather, as she never was in the habit of doing any work, but she was only a minute or so at it when up came the same little fellow with the red cap, and said: 'Who's that pulling the roof off my house?' 'What's that to you?' said she", " 'Well, if you will give me a bit of your dinner I won't do you any mischief,' said he", " 'I will give you something else in place of my dinner,' said she", " 'I can easily eat it myself; but if you will have something you can have a whack of my stick,' and with that she raised it in the air and struck the bergman over the head with it", " 'What a wicked little girl you are!' said he; 'but you shall be none the better of this", ' I shall give you three wishes, and choose them for you He had all at once remembered the resolution of the goblins to carry out their second plan upon the failure of the first  No doubt they were already busy, and the mine was therefore in the greatest danger of being flooded and rendered useless--not to speak of the lives of the miners  When he reached the mouth of the mine, after rousing all the miners within reach, he found his father and a good many more just entering  They all hurried to the gang by which he had found a way into the goblin country  There the foresight of Peter had already collected a great many blocks of stone, with cement, ready for building up the weak place--well enough known to the goblins  Although there was not room for more than two to be actually building at once, they managed, by setting all the rest to work in preparing the cement and passing the stones, to finish in the course of the day a huge buttress filling the whole gang, and supported everywhere by the live rock  Before the hour when they usually dropped work, they were satisfied the mine was secure  They had heard goblin hammers and pickaxes busy all the time, and at length fancied they heard sounds of water they had never heard before  But that was otherwise accounted for when they left the mine, for they stepped out into a tremendous storm which was raging all over the mountain  The thunder was bellowing, and the lightning lancing out of a huge black cloud which lay above it and hung down its edges of thick mist over its sides  The lightning was breaking out of the mountain, too, and flashing up into the cloud  From the state of the brooks, now swollen into raging torrents, it was evident that the storm had been storming all day  The wind was blowing as if it would blow him off the mountain, but, anxious about his mother and the princess, Curdie darted up through the thick of the tempest  Even if they had not set out before the storm came on, he did not judge them safe, for in such a storm even their poor little house was in danger  Indeed he soon found that but for a huge rock against which it was built, and which protected it both from the blasts and the waters, it must have been swept if it was not blown away; for the two torrents into which this rock parted the rush of water behind it united again in front of the cottage--two roaring and dangerous streams, which his mother and the princess could not possibly have passed  It was with great difficulty that he forced his way through one of them, and up to the door', " The moment his hand fell on the latch, through all the uproar of winds and Waters came the joyous cry of the princess: 'There's Curdie! Curdie! Curdie!' She was sitting wrapped in blankets on the bed, his mother trying for the hundredth time to light the fire which had been drowned by the rain that came down the chimney", ' The clay floor was one mass of mud, and the whole place looked wretched  But the faces of the mother and the princess shone as if their troubles only made them the merrier  Curdie burst out laughing at the sight of them', " 'I never had such fun!' said the princess, her eyes twinkling and her pretty teeth shining", " 'How nice it must be to live in a cottage on the mountain!' 'It all depends on what kind your inside house is,' said the mother", " 'I know what you mean,' said Irene", " 'That's the kind of thing my grandmother says", "' By the time Peter returned the storm was nearly over, but the streams were so fierce and so swollen that it was not only out of the question for the princess to go down the mountain, but most dangerous for Peter even or Curdie to make the attempt in the gathering darkness", " 'They will be dreadfully frightened about you,' said Peter to the princess, 'but we cannot help it", ' We must wait till the morning', "' With Curdie's help, the fire was lighted at last, and the mother set about making their supper; and after supper they all told the princess stories till she grew sleepy", " Then Curdie's mother laid her in Curdie's bed, which was in a tiny little garret-room", " As soon as she was in bed, through a little window low down in the roof she caught sight of her grandmother's lamp shining far away beneath, and she gazed at the beautiful silvery globe until she fell asleep" ,  'Master pfriem was a short, thin, but lively man, who never rested a moment  His face, of which his turned-up nose was the only prominent feature, was marked with smallpox and pale as death  His hair was gray and shaggy, his eyes small, but they glanced perpetually about on all sides  He saw everything, criticized everything, knew everything best, and was always in the right  When he went into the streets, he moved his arms about as if he were rowing, and once he struck the pail of a girl so high in the air that he himself was wetted all over by the water she was carrying  Idiot  Cried he to her, shaking himself, could you not see that I was coming behind you  By trade he was a shoemaker, and when he worked he pulled his thread out with such force that he drove his fist into everyone who did not keep far enough off  No apprentice stayed more than a month with him, for he had always some fault to find with the very best work  At one time it was that the stitches were not even, at another that one shoe was too long, or one heel higher than the other, or the leather not cut large enough  Wait, said he to his apprentice, I will soon show you how we make skins soft  And he brought a strap and gave him a couple of lashes across the back  He called them all sluggards  He himself did not turn much work out of his hands, for he never sat still for a quarter of an hour  If his wife got up very early in the morning and lighted the fire, he jumped out of bed, and ran barefooted into the kitchen, crying, will you burn my house down for me  That is a fire one could roast an ox by  Does wood cost nothing  If the servants were standing by their wash-tubs and laughing, and telling each other what they knew, he scolded them, and said, there stand the geese cackling, and forgetting their work, to gossip  And why fresh soap  Disgraceful extravagance and shameful idleness into the bargain  They want to save their hands, and not rub the things properly  And out he would run and knock a pail full of soap and water over, so that the whole kitchen was flooded  Someone was building a new house, so he hurrried to the window to look on  There, they are using that red sand-stone again that never dries, cried he  No one will ever be healthy in that house  And just look how badly the fellows are laying the stones  Besides, the mortar is good for nothing  It ought to have gravel in it, not sand  I shall live to see that house tumble down on the people who are in it', " He sat down, put a couple of stitches in, and then jumped up again, unfastened his leather-apron, and cried, I will just go out, and appeal to those men's consciences" ,  ' There was once a man who had a son who was very clever at reading, and took great delight in it  He went out into the world to seek service somewhere, and as he was walking between some mounds he met a man, who asked him where he was going', " 'I am going about seeking for service,' said the boy", " 'Will you serve me?' asked the man", " 'Oh, yes; just as readily you as anyone else,' said the boy", " 'But can you read?' asked the man", " 'As well as the priest,' said the boy", " Then I can't have you,' said the man", " 'In fact, I was just wanting a boy who couldn't read", ' His only work would be to dust my old books', "' The man then went on his way, and left the boy looking after him", " 'It was a pity I didn't get that place,' thought he 'That was just the very thing for me", "' Making up his mind to get the situation if possible, he hid himself behind one of the mounds, and turned his jacket outside in, so that the man would not know him again so easily", ' Then he ran along behind the mounds, and met the man at the other end of them', " 'Where are you going, my little boy?' said the man, who did not notice that it was the same one he had met before", " 'I am going about seeking for service?' said the boy", " 'Will you serve me?' asked the man", " 'Oh, yes; just as readily you as anyone else,' said the boy", " 'But can you read?' said the man", " 'No, I don't know a single letter,' said the boy", " The man then took him into his service, and all the work he had to do was to dust his master's books", ' But as he did this he had plenty of time to read them as well, and he read away at them until at last he was just as wise as his master--who was a great wizard--and could perform all kinds of magic  Among other feats, he could change himself into the shape of any animal, or any other thing that he pleased  When he had learned all this he did not think it worth while staying there any longer, so he ran away home to his parents again  Soon after this there was a market in the next village, and the boy told his mother that he had learned how to change himself into the shape of any animal he chose', " 'Now,' said he, 'I shall change myself to a horse, and father can take me to market and sell me", ' I shall come home again all right', "' His mother was frightened at the idea, but the boy told her that she need not be alarmed; all would be well", ' So he changed himself to a horse, such a fine horse, too, that his father got a high price for it at the market; but after the bargain was made, and the money paid, the boy changed again to his own shape, when no one was looking, and went home  The story spread all over the country about the fine horse that had been sold and then had disappeared, and at last the news came to the ears of the wizard  THERE was once upon a time a couple of needy folk who lived in a wretched hut, in which there was nothing but black want; so they had neither food to eat nor wood to burn  But if they had next to nothing of all else they had the blessing of God so far as children were concerned, and every year brought them one more  The man was not overpleased at this  He was always going about grumbling and growling, and saying that it seemed to him that there might be such a thing as having too many of these good gifts; so shortly before another baby was born he went away into the wood for some firewood, saying that he did not want to see the new child; he would hear him quite soon enough when he began to squall for some food  As soon as this baby was born it began to look about the room', " 'Ah, my dear mother!' said he, 'give me some of my brothers' old clothes, and food enough for a few days, and I will go out into the world and seek my fortune, for, so far as I can see, you have children enough", "' 'Heaven help thee, my son!' said the mother, 'that will never do; thou art still far too little", "' But the little creature was determined to do it, and begged and prayed so long that the mother was forced to let him have some old rags, and tie up a little food for him, and then gaily and happily he went out into the world", " But almost before he was out of the house another boy was born, and he too looked about him, and said, 'Ah, my dear mother! give me some of my brothers' old clothes, and food for some days, and then I will go out into the world and find my twin brother, for you have children enough", "' 'Heaven help thee, little creature! thou art far too little for that,' said the woman; 'it would never do", "' But she spoke to no purpose, for the boy begged and prayed until he had got some old rags and a bundle of provisions, and then he set out manfully into the world to find his twin brother", ' When the younger had walked for some time he caught sight of his brother a short distance in front of him, and called to him and bade him to stop', " 'Wait a minute,' he said; 'you are walking as if for a wager, but you ought to have stayed to see your younger brother before you hurried off into the world", "' So the elder stood still and looked back, and when the younger had got up to him, and had told him that he was his brother, he said: 'But now, let us sit down and see what kind of food our mother has given us,' and that they did", ' When they had walked on a little farther they came to a brook which ran through a green meadow, and there the younger said that they ought to christen each other', " 'As we had to make such haste, and had no time to do it at home, we may as well do it here,' said he", " 'What will you be called?' asked the elder", " 'I will be called Minnikin,' answered the second; 'and you, what will you be called?' 'I will be called King Pippin,' answered the elder", ' They christened each other and then went onwards  When they had walked for some time they came to a crossway, and there they agreed to part, and each take his own road  This they did, but no sooner had they walked a short distance than they met again  So they parted once more, and each took his own road, but in a very short time the same thing happened again--they met each other before they were at all aware, and so it happened the third time also  Then they arranged with each other that each should choose his own quarter, and one should go east and the other west', " 'But if ever you fall into any need or trouble,' said the elder, 'call me thrice, and I will come and help you; only you must not call me until you are in the utmost need", "' 'In that case we shall not see each other for some time,' said Minnikin; so they bade farewell to each other, and Minnikin went east and King Pippin went west", ' When Minnikin had walked a long way alone, he met an old, old crook-backed hag, who had only one eye  Minnikin stole it', " 'Oh! oh!' cried the old hag, 'what has become of my eye?' 'What will you give me to get your eye back?' said Minnikin", " 'I will give thee a sword which is such a sword that it can conquer a whole army, let it be ever so great,' replied the woman", " 'Let me have it, then,' said Minnikin" ,  ' There was once a little boy, whose father and mother, when they were dying, left him to the care of a guardian  But the guardian whom they chose turned out to be a wicked man, and spent all the money, so the boy determined to go away and strike out a path for himself  So one day he set off, and walked and walked through woods and meadows till when evening came he was very tired, and did not know where to sleep  He climbed a hill and looked about him to see if there was no light shining from a window  At first all seemed dark, but at length he noticed a tiny spark far, far off, and, plucking up his spirits, he at once went in search of it  The night was nearly half over before he reached the spark, which turned out to be a big fire, and by the fire a man was sleeping who was so tall he might have been a giant  The boy hesitated for a moment what he should do; then he crept close up to the man, and lay down by his legs  When the man awoke in the morning he was much surprised to find the boy nestling up close to him', " 'Dear me! where do you come from?' said he", " 'I am your son, born in the night,' replied the boy", " 'If that is true,' said the man, 'you shall take care of my sheep, and I will give you food", ' But take care you never cross the border of my land, or you will repent it', "' Then he pointed out where the border of his land lay, and bade the boy begin his work at once", ' The young shepherd led his flock out to the richest meadows and stayed with them till evening, when he brought them back, and helped the man to milk them', " When this was done, they both sat down to supper, and while they were eating the boy asked the big man: 'What is your name, father?' 'Mogarzea,' answered he", " 'I wonder you are not tired of living by yourself in this lonely place", "' 'There is no reason you should wonder! Don't you know that there was never a bear yet who danced of his own free will?' 'Yes, that is true,' replied the boy", " 'But why is it you are always so sad? Tell me your history, father", "' 'What is the use of my telling you things that would only make you sad too?' 'Oh, never mind that! I should like to hear", " Are you not my father, and am I not your son?' 'Well, if you really want to know my story, this is it: As I told you, my name is Mogarzea, and my father is an emperor", ' I was on my way to the Sweet Milk Lake, which lies not far from here, to marry one of the three fairies who have made the lake their home', " But on the road three wicked elves fell on me, and robbed me of my soul, so that ever since I have stayed in this spot watching my sheep without wishing for anything different, without having felt one moment's joy, or ever once being able to laugh", ' And the horrible elves are so ill-natured that if anyone sets one foot on their land he is instantly punished  That is why I warn you to be careful, lest you should share my fate', "' 'All right, I will take great care", " Do let me go, father,' said the boy, as they stretched themselves out to sleep", " At sunrise the boy got up and led his sheep out to feed, and for some reason he did not feel tempted to cross into the grassy meadows belonging to the elves, but let his flock pick up what pasture they could on Mogarzea's dry ground", ' On the third day he was sitting under the shadow of a tree, playing on his flute--and there was nobody in the world who could play a flute better--when one of his sheep strayed across the fence into the flowery fields of the elves, and another and another followed it  But the boy was so absorbed in his flute that he noticed nothing till half the flock were on the other side  He jumped up, still playing on his flute, and went after the sheep, meaning to drive them back to their own side of the border, when suddenly he saw before him three beautiful maidens who stopped in front of him, and began to dance  Long, long ago there lived, an old man and an old woman; they were peasants, and had to work hard to earn their daily rice  The old man used to go and cut grass for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little rice field  One day the old man went to the hills as usual to cut grass and the old woman took some clothes to the river to wash  It was nearly summer, and the country was very beautiful to see in its fresh greenness as the two old people went on their way to work  The grass on the banks of the river looked like emerald velvet, and the pussy willows along the edge of the water were shaking out their soft tassels  The breezes blew and ruffled the smooth surface of the water into wavelets, and passing on touched the cheeks of the old couple who, for some reason they could not explain, felt very happy that morning  The old woman at last found a nice spot by the river bank and put her basket down  Then she set to work to wash the clothes; she took them one by one out of the basket and washed them in the river and rubbed them on the stones  The water was as clear as crystal, and she could see the tiny fish swimming to and fro, and the pebbles at the bottom  As she was busy washing her clothes a great peach came bumping down the stream  The old woman looked up from her work and saw this large peach  She was sixty years of age, yet in all her life she had never seen such a big peach as this  "How delicious that peach must be!" she said to herself  "I must certainly get it and take it home to my old man " She stretched out her arm to try and get it, but it was quite out of her reach  She looked about for a stick, but there was not one to be seen, and if she went to look for one she would lose the peach  Stopping a moment to think what she would do, she remembered an old charm-verse  Now she began to clap her hands to keep time to the rolling of the peach down stream, and while she clapped she sang this song:  "Distant water is bitter,  The near water is sweet;  Pass by the distant water  And come into the sweet " Strange to say, as soon as she began to repeat this little song the peach began to come nearer and nearer the bank where the old woman was standing, till at last it stopped just in front of her so that she was able to take it up in her hands  The old woman was delighted  She could not go on with her work, so happy and excited was she, so she put all the clothes back in her bamboo basket, and with the basket on her back and the peach in her hand she hurried homewards  It seemed a very long time to her to wait till her husband returned  The old man at last came back as the sun was setting, with a big bundle of grass on his back--so big that he was almost hidden and she could hardly see him  He seemed very tired and used the scythe for a walking stick, leaning on it as he walked along  As soon as the old woman saw him she called out: "O Fii San! (old man) I have been waiting for you to come home for such a long time to-day!" "What is the matter? Why are you so impatient?" asked the old man, wondering at her unusual eagerness  "Has anything happened while I have been away?" "Oh, no!" answered the old woman, "nothing has happened, only I have found a nice present for you!" "That is good," said the old man  He then washed his feet in a basin of water and stepped up to the veranda  The old woman now ran into the little room and brought out from the cupboard the big peach  It felt even heavier than before  She held it up to him, saying: "Just look at this! Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?" When the old man looked at the peach he was greatly astonished and said: "This is indeed the largest peach I have ever seen! Wherever did you buy it?" "I did not buy it," answered the old woman _Mor of Cloyne, a Munster Princess, is singing at the door of a Fairy Rath to her sister, a captive within it, the magic tune by which she once escaped from a like captivity _  Little Sister, whom the Fay   Hides away within his doon,  Deep below yon seeding fern,   Oh, list and learn my magic tune', "  Long ago, when snared like thee   By the Shee, my harp and I  O'er them wove the slumber spell,   Warbling well its lullaby", '  Till with dreamy smiles they sank,   Rank on rank, before the strain;

and he asked God to prosper the day for him; and he went down to the brink of the sea, and he saw a currach, short and green, coming towards him; and in it there was but one youthful champion, and he playing hurly from prow to stern of the currach  He had a hurl of gold and a ball of silver; and he stopped not until the currach was in on the shore; and he drew her up on the green grass, and put fastening on her for a day and a year, whether he should be there all that time, or should only be on land for an hour by the clock  And Morraha saluted the young man in words intelligent, intelligible, such as were spoken at that time; and the other saluted him in the same fashion, and asked him would he play a game of cards with him; and Morraha said he had not the wherewithal; and the other answered that he was never without a candle or the making of it; and he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a table and two chairs and a pack of cards, and they sat down on the chairs and went to the card-playing  The first game Morraha won, and the slender red champion bade him make his claim; and he said that the land above him should be filled with stock of sheep in the morning  It was well, and he played no second game, but home he went  The next day Morraha went to the brink of the sea, and the young man came in the currach and asked him would he play cards; and they played, and Morraha won  And the young man bade him make his claim; and he said that the land above should be filled with cattle in the morning  It was well, and he played no other game, but went home  And on the third morning Morraha went to the brink of the sea, and he saw the young man coming  And he drew up his boat on the shore, and asked him would he play cards  And they played, and Morraha won the game; and the young man bade him give his claim  And he said he should have a castle, and of women the finest and fairest; and they were his  It was well, and the young man went away  On the fourth day the woman asked him how he had found himself, and he told her  "And I am going out," said he, "to play again to-day " "I cross (forbid) you go again to him  If you have won so much, you will lose more; and have no more to do with him " But he went against her will, and he saw the currach coming, and the young man was driving his balls from end to end of the currach  He had balls of silver and a hurl of gold, and he stopped not till he drew his boat on the shore, and made her fast for a year and a day  And Morraha and he saluted each other; and he asked Morraha if he would play a game of cards, and they played and he won  And Morraha said to him, "Give your claim, now " Said he, "You will hear it too soon  I lay on you the bonds of the art of the Druid not to sleep two nights in one house, nor finish a second meal at the one table, till you bring me the sword of light and news of the death of Anshgayliacht " He went down to his wife, and sat down in a chair, and gave a groan, and the chair broke in pieces  "It is the son of a king under spells you are," said his wife; "and you had better have taken my counsel than that the spells should be on you " He said to her to bring news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword of light to the slender red champion  "Go out," said she, "in the morning of the morrow, and take the bridle in the window and shake it; and whatever beast, handsome or ugly, puts the head in it, take that one with you', " Do not speak a word to her till she speaks to you; and take with you three pint bottles of ale and three sixpenny loaves, and do the thing she tells you;

but if it is the son of a poor man, let him come no further " He rose in the morning, and took the bridle that was in the window and went out and shook it, and Brown Allree came and put her head in it There was once a widow who had two daughters - one of whom was pretty and industrious, whilst the other was ugly and idle  But she was much fonder of the ugly and idle one, because she was her own daughter  And the other, who was a step-daughter, was obliged to do all the work, and be the cinderella of the house  Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well, in the highway, and spin and spin till her fingers bled  Now it happened that one day the shuttle was marked with her blood, so she dipped it in the well, to wash the mark off, but it dropped out of her hand and fell to the bottom  She began to weep, and ran to her step-mother and told her of the mishap  But she scolded her sharply, and was so merciless as to say, since you have let the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again  So the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do  And in the sorrow of her heart she jumped into the well to get the shuttle  She lost her senses  And when she awoke and came to herself again, she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was shining and many thousands of flowers were growing', " Across this meadow she went, and at last came to a baker's oven full of bread, and the bread cried out, oh, take me out", ' Take me out  Or I shall burn  I have been baked a long time  So she went up to it, and took out all the loaves one after another with the bread-shovel  After that she went on till she came to a tree covered with apples, which called out to her, oh, shake me  Shake me  We apples are all ripe  So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain, and went on shaking till they were all down, and when she had gathered them into a heap, she went on her way  At last she came to a little house, out of which an old woman peeped  But she had such large teeth that the girl was frightened, and was about to run away  But the old woman called out to her, what are you afraid of, dear child  Stay with me  If you will do all the work in the house properly, you shall be the better for it  Only you must take care to make my bed well, and shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly - for then there is snow on the earth  I am mother holle  As the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took courage and agreed to enter her service  She attended to everything to the satisfaction of her mistress, and always shook her bed so vigorously that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes  So she had a pleasant life with her  ONCE upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was pretty and clever, and the other ugly and lazy  But as the ugly one was her own daughter, she liked her far the best of the two, and the pretty one had to do all the work of the house, and was in fact the regular maid of all work  Every day she had to sit by a well on the high road, and spin till her fingers were so sore that they often bled  One day some drops of blood fell on her spindle, so she dipped it into the well meaning to wash it, but, as luck would have it, it dropped from her hand and fell right in', " She ran weeping to her stepmother, and told her what had happened, but she scolded her harshly, and was so merciless in her anger that she said: 'Well, since you've dropped the spindle down, you must just go after it yourself, and don't let me see your face again until you bring it with you", "' Then the poor girl returned to the well, and not knowing what she was about, in the despair and misery of her heart she sprang into the well and sank to the bottom", ' For a time she lost all consciousness, and when she came to herself again she was lying in a lovely meadow, with the sun shining brightly overhead, and a thousand flowers blooming at her feet', " She rose up and wandered through this enchanted place, till she came to a baker's oven full of bread, and the bread called out to her as she passed: 'Oh! take me out, take me out, or I shall be burnt to a cinder", ' I am quite done enough', "' So she stepped up quickly to the oven and took out all the loaves one after the other", " Then she went on a little farther and came to a tree laden with beautiful rosy-cheeked apples, and as she passed by it called out: 'Oh I shake me, shake me, my apples are all quite ripe", "' She did as she was asked, and shook the tree till the apples fell like rain and none were left hanging", ' When she had gathered them all up into a heap she went on her way again, and came at length to a little house, at the door of which sat an old woman', " The old dame had such large teeth that the girl felt frightened and wanted to run away, but the old woman called after her: 'What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me and be my little maid, and if you do your work well I will reward you handsomely; but you must be very careful how you make my bed--you must shake it well till the feathers fly; then people in the world below say it snows, for I am Mother Holle", "' She spoke so kindly that the girl took heart and agreed readily to enter her service", ' She did her best to please the old woman, and shook her bed with such a will that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes; so she led a very easy life, was never scolded, and lived on the fat of the land  But after she had been some time with Mother Holle she grew sad and depressed, and at first she hardly knew herself what was the matter', " At last she discovered that she was homesick, so she went to Mother Holle and said: 'I know I am a thousand times better off here than I ever was in my life before, but notwithstanding, I have a great longing to go home, in spite of all your kindness to me", ' I can remain with you no longer, but must return to my own people', "' 'Your desire to go home pleases me,' said Mother Holle, 'and because you have served me so faithfully, I will show you the way back into the world myself", "' So she took her by the hand and led her to an open door, and as the girl passed through it there fell a heavy shower of gold all over her, till she was covered with it from top to toe", " 'That's a reward for being such a good little maid,' said Mother Holle, and she gave her the spindle too that had fallen into the well", " Then she shut the door, and the girl found herself back in the world again, not far from her own house; and when she came to the courtyard the old hen, who sat on the top of the wall, called out:    'Click, clock, clack,   Our golden maid's come back", "' Then she went in to her stepmother, and as she had returned covered with gold she was welcomed home", ' She proceeded to tell all that had happened to her, and when the mother heard how she had come by her riches, she was most anxious to secure the same luck for her own idle, ugly daughter; so she told her to sit at the well and spin  In order to make her spindle bloody, she stuck her hand into a hedge of thorns and pricked her finger  Then she threw the spindle into the well, and jumped in herself after it  Like her sister she came to the beautiful meadow, and followed the same path', " When she reached the baker's oven the bread called out as before: 'Oh! take me out, take me out, or I shall be burnt to a cinder", ' I am quite done enough  Once upon a time there was a youth called Moti, who was very big and strong, but the clumsiest creature you can imagine', " So clumsy was he that he was always putting his great feet into the bowls of sweet milk or curds which his mother set out on the floor to cool, always smashing, upsetting, breaking, until at last his father said to him: 'Here, Moti, are fifty silver pieces which are the savings of years; take them and go and make your living or your fortune if you can", "' Then Moti started off one early spring morning with his thick staff over his shoulder, singing gaily to himself as he walked along", " In one way and another he got along very well until a hot evening when he came to a certain city where he entered the travellers' 'serai' or inn to pass the night", ' Now a serai, you must know, is generally just a large square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade along the inside all round to accommodate both men and beasts, and with perhaps a few rooms in towers at the corners for those who are too rich or too proud to care about sleeping by their own camels and horses', " Moti, of course, was a country lad and had lived with cattle all his life, and he wasn't rich and he wasn't proud, so he just borrowed a bed from the innkeeper, set it down beside an old buffalo who reminded him of home, and in five minutes was fast asleep", ' In the middle of the night he woke, feeling that he had been disturbed, and putting his hand under his pillow found to his horror that his bag of money had been stolen  He jumped up quietly and began to prowl around to see whether anyone seemed to be awake, but, though he managed to arouse a few men and beasts by falling over them, he walked in the shadow of the archways round the whole serai without coming across a likely thief  He was just about to give it up when he overheard two men whispering, and one laughed softly, and peering behind a pillar, he saw two Afghan horsedealers counting out his bag of money! Then Moti went back to bed! In the morning Moti followed the two Afghans outside the city to the horsemarket in which they horses were offered for sale', " Choosing the best-looking horse amongst them he went up to it and said: 'Is this horse for sale? may I try it?' and, the merchants assenting, he scrambled up on its back, dug in his heels, and off they flew", ' Now Moti had never been on a horse in his life, and had so much ado to hold on with both hands as well as with both legs that the animal went just where it liked, and very soon broke into a break-neck gallop and made straight back to the serai where it had spent the last few nights', " 'This will do very well,' thought Moti as they whirled in at the entrance", ' As soon as the horse had arrived at its table it stopped of its own accord and Moti immediately rolled off; but he jumped up at once, tied the beast up, and called for some breakfast  Presently the Afghans appeared, out of breath and furious, and claimed the horse', " 'What do you mean?' cried Moti, with his mouth full of rice, 'it's my horse; I paid you fifty pieces of silver for it--quite a bargain, I'm sure!' 'Nonsense! it is our horse,' answered one of the Afghans beginning to untie the bridle", " 'Leave off,' shouted Moti, seizing his staff; 'if you don't let my horse alone I'll crack your skulls! you thieves! I know you! Last night you took my money, so to-day I took your horse; that's fair enough!' Now the Afghans began to look a little uncomfortable, but Moti seemed so determined to keep the horse that they resolved to appeal to the law, so they went off and laid a complaint before the king that Moti had stolen one of their horses and would not give it up nor pay for it", ' Presently a soldier came to summon Moti to the king; and, when he arrived and made his obeisance, the king began to question him as to why he had galloped off with the horse in this fashion', " But Moti declared that he had got the animal in exchange for fifty pieces of silver, whilst the horse merchants vowed that the money they had on them was what they had received for the sale of other horses; and in one way and another the dispute got so confusing that the king (who really thought that Moti had stolen the horse) said at last, 'Well, I tell you what I will do", " I will lock something into this box before me, and if he guesses what it is, the horse is his, and if he doesn't then it is yours", "' To this Moti agreed, and the king arose and went out alone by a little door at the back of the Court, and presently came back clasping something closely wrapped up in a cloth under his robe, slipped it into the little box, locked the box, and set it up where all might see", " 'Now,' said the king to Moti, 'guess!' It happened that when the king had opened the door behind him, Moti noticed that there was a garden outside: without waiting for the king's return he began to think what could be got out of the garden small enough to be shut in the box", " 'Is it likely to be a fruit or a flower? No, not a flower this time, for he clasped it too tight", ' Then it must be a fruit or a stone', " Yet not a stone, because he wouldn't wrap a dirty stone in his nice clean cloth", ' Then it is a fruit! And a fruit without much scent, or else he would be afraid that I might smell it', " Now what fruit without much scent is in season just now? When I know that I shall have guessed the riddle!' As has been said before, Moti was a country lad, and was accustomed to work in his father's garden", " He knew all the common fruits, so he thought he ought to be able to guess right; but so as not to let it seem too easy, he gazed up at the ceiling with a puzzled expression, and looked down at the floor with an air or wisdom and his fingers pressed against his forehead, and then he said, slowly, with his eyes on the king,-- 'It is freshly plucked! It is round and it is red! It is a pomegranate!' Now the king knew nothing about fruits except that they were good to eat; and, as for seasons, he asked for whatever fruit he wanted whenever he wanted it, and saw that he got it; so to him Moti's guess was like a miracle, and clear proof not only of his wisdom but of his innocence, for it was a pomegranate that he had put into the box", " Of course when the king marvelled and praised Moti's wisdom, everybody else did so too; and, whilst the Afghans went off crestfallen, Moti took the horse and entered the king's service", ' Very soon after this, Moti, who continued to live in the serai, came back one wet and stormy evening to find that his precious horse had strayed  Nothing remained of him but a broken halter cord, and no one knew what had become of him  Once upon a time, in a very hot country, a man lived with his wife in a little hut, which was surrounded by grass and flowers  They were perfectly happy together till, by-and-by, the woman fell ill and refused to take any food  The husband tried to persuade her to eat all sorts of delicious fruits that he had found in the forest, but she would have none of them, and grew so thin he feared she would die', " 'Is there nothing you would like?' he said at last in despair", " 'Yes, I think I could eat some wild honey,' answered she", ' The husband was overjoyed, for he thought this sounded easy enough to get, and he went off at once in search of it  He came back with a wooden pan quite full, and gave it to his wife', " 'I can't eat that,' she said, turning away in disgust", " 'Look! there are some dead bees in it! I want honey that is quite pure", "' And the man threw the rejected honey on the grass, and started off to get some fresh", ' When he got back he offered it to his wife, who treated it as she had done the first bowlful', " 'That honey has got ants in it: throw it away,' she said, and when he brought her some more, she declared it was full of earth", ' In his fourth journey he managed to find some that she would eat, and then she begged him to get her some water  This took him some time, but at length he came to a lake whose waters were sweetened with sugar  He filled a pannikin quite full, and carried it home to his wife, who drank it eagerly, and said that she now felt quite well', " When she was up and had dressed herself, her husband lay down in her place, saying: 'You have given me a great deal of trouble, and now it is my turn!' 'What is the matter with you?' asked the wife", " 'I am thirsty and want some water,' answered he; and she took a large pot and carried it to the nearest spring, which was a good way off", " 'Here is the water,' she said to her husband, lifting the heavy pot from her head; but he turned away in disgust", " 'You have drawn it from the pool that is full of frogs and willows; you must get me some more", "' So the woman set out again and walked still further to another lake", " 'This water tastes of rushes,' he exclaimed, 'go and get some fresh", "' But when she brought back a third supply he declared that it seemed made up of water-lilies, and that he must have water that was pure, and not spoilt by willows, or frogs, or rushes", ' So for the fourth time she put her jug on her head, and passing all the lakes she had hitherto tried, she came to another, where the water was golden like honey  She stooped down to drink, when a horrible head bobbed up on the surface', " 'How dare you steal my water?' cried the head", " 'It is my husband who has sent me,' she replied, trembling all over", " 'But do not kill me! You shall have my baby, if you will only let me go", "' 'How am I to know which is your baby?' asked the Ogre", " 'Oh, that is easily managed", ' I will shave both sides of his head, and hang some white beads round his neck There once lived a Munachar and a Manachar, a long time ago, and it is a long time since it was, and if they were alive now they would not be alive then  They went out together to pick raspberries, and as many as Munachar used to pick Manachar used to eat  Munachar said he must go look for a rod to make a gad to hang Manachar, who ate his raspberries every one; and he came to the rod  "What news the day?" said the rod  "It is my own news that I\'m seeking  Going looking for a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one " "You will not get me," said the rod, "until you get an axe to cut me " He came to the axe  "What news to-day?" said the axe  "It\'s my own news I\'m seeking  Going looking for an axe, an axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one " "You will not get me," said the axe, "until you get a flag to edge me " He came to the flag  "What news today?" says the flag  "It\'s my own news I\'m seeking  Going looking for a flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one " "You will not get me," says the flag, "till you get water to wet me " He came to the water  "What news to-day?" says the water  "It\'s my own news that I\'m seeking  Going looking for water, water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one " "You will not get me," said the water, "until you get a deer who will swim me " He came to the deer  "What news to-day?" says the deer  "It\'s my own news I\'m seeking  Going looking for a deer, deer to swim water, water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one " "You will not get me," said the deer, "until you get a hound who will hunt me " He came to the hound  "What news to-day?" says the hound  "It\'s my own news I\'m seeking  In the days when Murtough Mac Erca was in the High Kingship of Ireland, the country was divided between the old beliefs of paganism and the new doctrines of the Christian teaching  Part held with the old creed and part with the new, and the thought of the people was troubled between them, for they knew not which way to follow and which to forsake  The faith of their forefathers clung close around them, holding them by many fine and tender threads of memory and custom and tradition; yet still the new faith was making its way, and every day it spread wider and wider through the land  The family of Murtough had joined itself to the Christian faith, and his three brothers were bishops and abbots of the Church, but Murtough himself remained a pagan, for he was a wild and lawless prince, and the peaceful teachings of the Christian doctrine, with its forgiveness of enemies, pleased him not at all  Fierce and cruel was his life, filled with dark deeds and bloody wars, and savage and tragic was his death, as we shall hear  Now Murtough was in the sunny summer palace of Cletty, which Cormac, son of Art, had built for a pleasure house on the brink of the slow-flowing Boyne, near the Fairy Brugh of Angus the Ever Young, the God of Youth and Beauty  A day of summer was that day, and the King came forth to hunt on the borders of the Brugh, with all his boon companions around him  But when the high-noon came the sun grew hot, and the King sat down to rest upon the fairy mound, and the hunt passed on beyond him, and he was left alone  There was a witch woman in that country whose name was "Sigh, Sough, Storm, Rough Wind, Winter Night, Cry, Wail, and Groan " Star-bright and beautiful was she in face and form, but inwardly she was cruel as her names  And she hated Murtough because he had scattered and destroyed the Ancient Peoples of the Fairy Tribes of Erin, her country and her fatherland, and because in the battle which he fought at Cerb on the Boyne her father and her mother and her sister had been slain  For in those days women went to battle side by side with men  She knew, too, that with the coming of the new faith trouble would come upon the fairy folk, and their power and their great majesty would depart from them, and men would call them demons, and would drive them out with psalm-singing and with the saying of prayers, and with the sound of little tinkling bells  So trouble and anger wrought in the witch woman, and she waited the day to be revenged on Murtough, for he being yet a pagan, was still within her power to harm  So when Sheen (for Sheen or "Storm" was the name men gave to her) saw the King seated on the fairy mound and all his comrades parted from him, she arose softly, and combed her hair with her comb of silver adorned with little ribs of gold, and she washed her hands in a silver basin wherein were four golden birds sitting on the rim of the bowl, and little bright gems of carbuncle set round about the rim  And she donned her fairy mantle of flowing green, and her cloak, wide and hooded, with silvery fringes, and a brooch of fairest gold  On her head were tresses yellow like to gold, plaited in four locks, with a golden drop at the end of each long tress  The hue of her hair was like the flower of the iris in summer or like red gold after the burnishing thereof  And she wore on her breasts and at her shoulders marvellous clasps of gold, finely worked with the tracery of the skilled craftsman, and a golden twisted torque around her throat  And when she was decked she went softly and sat down beside Murtough on the turfy hunting mound', " And after a space Murtough perceived her sitting there, and the sun shining upon her, so that the glittering of the gold and of her golden hair and the bright shining of the green silk of her garments, was like the yellow iris-beds upon the lake on a sunny summer's day", " Wonder and terror seized on Murtough at her beauty, and he knew not if he loved her or if he hated her the most; for at one moment all his nature was filled with longing and with love of her, so that it seemed to him that he would give the whole of Ireland for the loan of one hour's space of dalliance with her; but after that he felt a dread of her, because he knew his fate was in her hands, and that she had come to work him ill", ' But he welcomed her as if she were known to him and he asked her wherefore she was come  "I am come," she said, "because I am beloved of Murtough, son of Erc, King of Erin, and I come to seek him here " Then Murtough was glad, and he said, "Dost thou not know me, maiden?" "I do," she answered, "for all secret and mysterious things are known to me and thou and all the men of Erin are well known " After he had conversed with her awhile, she appeared to him so fair that the King was ready to promise her anything in life she wished, so long as she would go with him to Cletty of the Boyne  "My wish," she said, "is that you take me to your house, and that you put out from it your wife and your children because they are of the new faith, and all the clerics that are in your house, and that neither your wife nor any cleric be permitted to enter the house while I am there " "I will give you," said the King, "a hundred head of every herd of cattle that is within my kingdom, and a hundred drinking horns, and a hundred cups, and a hundred rings of gold, and a feast every other night in the summer palace of Cletty  But I pledge thee my word, oh, maiden, it were easier for me to give thee half of Ireland than to do this thing that thou hast asked " For Murtough feared that when those that were of the Christian faith were put out of his house, she would work her spells upon him, and no power would be left with him to resist those spells' ,  " On one of the great moors over in Jutland, where trees won't grow because the soil is so sandy and the wind so strong, there once lived a man and his wife, who had a little house and some sheep, and two sons who helped them to herd them", ' The elder of the two was called Rasmus, and the younger Niels  Rasmus was quite content to look after sheep, as his father had done before him, but Niels had a fancy to be a hunter, and was not happy till he got hold of a gun and learned to shoot  It was only an old muzzle-loading flint-lock after all, but Niels thought it a great prize, and went about shooting at everything he could see  So much did he practice that in the long run he became a wonderful shot, and was heard of even where he had never been seen  Some people said there was very little in him beyond this, but that was an idea they found reason to change in the course of time  The parents of Rasmus and Niels were good Catholics, and when they were getting old the mother took it into her head that she would like to go to Rome and see the Pope', " The others didn't see much use in this, but she had her way in the end: they sold all the sheep, shut up the house, and set out for Rome on foot", ' Niels took his gun with him', " 'What do you want with that?' said Rasmus; 'we have plenty to carry without it", "' But Niels could not be happy without his gun, and took it all the same", ' It was in the hottest part of summer that they began their journey, so hot that they could not travel at all in the middle of the day, and they were afraid to do it by night lest they might lose their way or fall into the hands of robbers  One day, a little before sunset, they came to an inn which lay at the edge of a forest', " 'We had better stay here for the night,' said Rasmus", " 'What an idea!' said Niels, who was growing impatient at the slow progress they were making", " 'We can't travel by day for the heat, and we remain where we are all night", ' It will be long enough before we get to Rome if we go on at this rate', "' Rasmus was unwilling to go on, but the two old people sided with Niels, who said, 'The nights aren't dark, and the moon will soon be up", ' We can ask at the inn here, and find out which way we ought to take', "' So they held on for some time, but at last they came to a small opening in the forest, and here they found that the road split in two", ' There was no sign-post to direct them, and the people in the inn had not told them which of the two roads to take', " 'What's to be done now?' said Rasmus", " 'I think we had better have stayed at the inn", "' 'There's no harm done,' said Niels", " 'The night is warm, and we can wait here till morning", ' One of us will keep watch till midnight, and then waken the other', "' Rasmus chose to take the first watch, and the others lay down to sleep", ' It was very quiet in the forest, and Rasmus could hear the deer and foxes and other animals moving about among the rustling leaves', " After the moon rose he could see them occasionally, and when a big stag came quite close to him he got hold of Niels' gun and shot it", ' Niels was wakened by the report There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle and negligent  When she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about on the ground beside her  Now she had a servant who was industrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away, cleaned them, spun them fine, and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself  A young man had wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place  On the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said, ah, how that girl does jump about, dressed in my hurds  The bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant by it  Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress made of the flax which she had thrown away  When the bridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the other, and chose her as his wife    But what became of little Gerda when Kay did not return? Where could he be? Nobody knew; nobody could give any intelligence  All the boys knew was, that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid one, which drove down the street and out of the town  Nobody knew where he was; many sad tears were shed, and little Gerda wept long and bitterly; at last she said he must be dead; that he had been drowned in the river which flowed close to the town  Oh! those were very long and dismal winter evenings! At last spring came, with its warm sunshine  "Kay is dead and gone!" said little Gerda  "That I don\'t believe," said the Sunshine  "Kay is dead and gone!" said she to the Swallows  "That I don\'t believe," said they: and at last little Gerda did not think so any longer either  "I\'ll put on my red shoes," said she, one morning; "Kay has never seen them, and then I\'ll go down to the river and ask there " It was quite early; she kissed her old grandmother, who was still asleep, put on her red shoes, and went alone to the river  "Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make you a present of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me " And, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner; then she took off her red shoes, the most precious things she possessed, and threw them both into the river  But they fell close to the bank, and the little waves bore them immediately to land; it was as if the stream would not take what was dearest to her; for in reality it had not got little Kay; but Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far enough, so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes, went to the farthest end, and threw out the shoes  But the boat was not fastened, and the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the shore  She observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could do so, the boat was more than a yard from the land, and was gliding quickly onward  Little Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one heard her except the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land; but they flew along the bank, and sang as if to comfort her, "Here we are! Here we are!" The boat drifted with the stream, little Gerda sat quite still without shoes, for they were swimming behind the boat, but she could not reach them, because the boat went much faster than they did  The banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable trees, and slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was to be seen  "Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay," said she; and then she grew less sad  She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful green banks  Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard, where was a little cottage with curious red and blue windows; it was thatched, and before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when anyone went past  Gerda called to them, for she thought they were alive; but they, of course, did not answer  She came close to them, for the stream drifted the boat quite near the land  Gerda called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the cottage, leaning upon a crooked stick  She had a large broad-brimmed hat on, painted with the most splendid flowers  "Poor little child!" said the old woman  "How did you get upon the large rapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world!" And then the old woman went into the water, caught hold of the boat with her crooked stick, drew it to the bank, and lifted little Gerda out  And Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again; but she was rather afraid of the strange old woman  "But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here," said she  And Gerda told her all; and the old woman shook her head and said, "A-hem! a-hem!" and when Gerda had told her everything, and asked her if she had not seen little Kay, the woman answered that he had not passed there, but he no doubt would come; and she told her not to be cast down, but taste her cherries, and look at her flowers, which were finer than any in a picture-book, each of which could tell a whole story  She then took Gerda by the hand, led her into the little cottage, and locked the door  The walls of the palace were formed of drifted snow, and the windows and doors of the cutting winds  There were more than a hundred rooms in it, all as if they had been formed with snow blown together', " The largest of them extended for several miles; they were all lighted up by the vivid light of the aurora, and they were so large and empty, so icy cold and glittering! There were no amusements here, not even a little bear's ball, when the storm might have been the music, and the bears could have danced on their hind legs, and shown their good manners", ' There were no pleasant games of snap-dragon, or touch, or even a gossip over the tea-table, for the young-lady foxes  Empty, vast, and cold were the halls of the Snow Queen  The flickering flame of the northern lights could be plainly seen, whether they rose high or low in the heavens, from every part of the castle  In the midst of its empty, endless hall of snow was a frozen lake, broken on its surface into a thousand forms; each piece resembled another, from being in itself perfect as a work of art, and in the centre of this lake sat the Snow Queen, when she was at home  She called the lake "The Mirror of Reason," and said that it was the best, and indeed the only one in the world  Little Kay was quite blue with cold, indeed almost black, but he did not feel it; for the Snow Queen had kissed away the icy shiverings, and his heart was already a lump of ice  He dragged some sharp, flat pieces of ice to and fro, and placed them together in all kinds of positions, as if he wished to make something out of them; just as we try to form various figures with little tablets of wood which we call "a Chinese puzzle " Kay\'s fingers were very artistic; it was the icy game of reason at which he played, and in his eyes the figures were very remarkable, and of the highest importance; this opinion was owing to the piece of glass still sticking in his eye  He composed many complete figures, forming different words, but there was one word he never could manage to form, although he wished it very much  It was the word "Eternity " The Snow Queen had said to him, "When you can find out this, you shall be your own master, and I will give you the whole world and a new pair of skates " But he could not accomplish it  "Now I must hasten away to warmer countries," said the Snow Queen  "I will go and look into the black craters of the tops of the burning mountains, Etna and Vesuvius, as they are called,--I shall make them look white, which will be good for them, and for the lemons and the grapes " And away flew the Snow Queen, leaving little Kay quite alone in the great hall which was so many miles in length; so he sat and looked at his pieces of ice, and was thinking so deeply, and sat so still, that any one might have supposed he was frozen  Just at this moment it happened that little Gerda came through the great door of the castle  Cutting winds were raging around her, but she offered up a prayer and the winds sank down as if they were going to sleep; and she went on till she came to the large empty hall, and caught sight of Kay; she knew him directly; she flew to him and threw her arms round his neck, and held him fast, while she exclaimed, "Kay, dear little Kay, I have found you at last " But he sat quite still, stiff and cold  Then little Gerda wept hot tears, which fell on his breast, and penetrated into his heart, and thawed the lump of ice, and washed away the little piece of glass which had stuck there  Then he looked at her, and she sang--  "Roses bloom and cease to be,  But we shall the Christ-child see " Then Kay burst into tears, and he wept so that the splinter of glass swam out of his eye  Then he recognized Gerda, and said, joyfully, "Gerda, dear little Gerda, where have you been all this time, and where have I been?" And he looked all around him, and said, "How cold it is, and how large and empty it all looks," and he clung to Gerda, and she laughed and wept for joy  It was so pleasing to see them that the pieces of ice even danced about; and when they were tired and went to lie down, they formed themselves into the letters of the word which the Snow Queen had said he must find out before he could be his own master, and have the whole world and a pair of new skates  Then Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they became blooming; and she kissed his eyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and his feet, and then he became quite healthy and cheerful  The Snow Queen might come home now when she pleased, for there stood his certainty of freedom, in the word she wanted, written in shining letters of ice  Then they took each other by the hand, and went forth from the great palace of ice  They spoke of the grandmother, and of the roses on the roof, and as they went on the winds were at rest, and the sun burst forth  A father had two sons, the elder of whom was forward and clever enough to do almost anything; but the younger was so stupid that he could learn nothing, and when the people saw him they said, "Will thy father still keep thee as a burden to him?" So, if anything was to be done, the elder had at all times to do it; but sometimes the father would call him to fetch something in the dead of night, and perhaps the way led through the churchyard or by a dismal place, and then he used to answer, "No, father, I cannot go there, I am afraid," for he was a coward  Or sometimes of an evening, tales were told by the fireside which made one shudder, and the listeners exclaimed, "Oh, it makes us shiver!" In a corner, meanwhile, sat the younger son, listening, but he could not comprehend what was said, and he thought, "They say continually, \'Oh, it makes us shiver, it makes us shiver!\' but perhaps shivering is an art which I cannot understand " One day, however, his father said to him, "Do you hear, you there in the corner? You are growing stout and big; you must learn some trade to get your living by  Do you see how your brother works? But as for you, you are not worth malt and hops " "Ah, father," answered he, "I would willingly learn something  When shall I begin? I want to know what shivering means, for of that I can understand nothing " The elder brother laughed when he heard this speech, and thought to himself, "Ah! my brother is such a simpleton that he cannot earn his own living  He who would make a good hedge must learn betimes to bend " But the father sighed and said, "What shivering means you may learn soon enough, but you will never get your bread by that " Soon after the parish sexton came in for a gossip, so the father told him his troubles, and how that his younger son was such a simpleton that he knew nothing and could learn nothing  "Just fancy, when I asked him how he intended to earn his bread, he desired to learn what shivering meant!" "Oh, if that be all," answered the sexton, "he can learn that soon enough with me; just send him to my place, and I will soon teach him " The father was very glad, because he thought that it would do the boy good; so the sexton took him home to ring the bells  About two days afterward he called him up at midnight to go into the church-tower to toll the bell  "You shall soon learn what shivering means," thought the sexton, and getting up he went out too  As soon as the boy reached the belfry, and turned himself round to seize the rope, he saw upon the stairs, near the sounding-hole, a white figure  "Who\'s there?" he called out; but the figure gave no answer, and neither stirred nor spoke  "Answer," said the boy, "or make haste off; you have no business here to-night " But the sexton did not stir, so that the boy might think it was a ghost  The boy called out a second time, "What are you doing here? Speak, if you are an honest fellow, or else I will throw you downstairs " The sexton said to himself, "That is not a bad thought"; but he remained quiet as if he were a stone  Then the boy called out for the third time, but it produced no effect; so, making a spring, he threw the ghost down the stairs, so that it rolled ten steps, and then lay motionless in a corner  Thereupon he rang the bell, and then going home, he went to bed without saying a word, and fell fast asleep', " The sexton's wife waited some time for her husband, but he did not come; so at last she became anxious, woke the boy, and asked him if he knew where her husband was, who had gone before him to the belfry", ' "No," answered the boy; "but there was someone standing on the steps who would not give any answer, nor go away, so I took him for a thief and threw him downstairs  Go now and see where he is; perhaps it may be he, but I should be sorry for it " The wife ran off and found her husband lying in a corner, groaning, with one of his ribs broken  She took him up and ran with loud outcries to the boy\'s father, and said to him, "Your son has brought a great misfortune on us; he has thrown my husband down and broken his bones  Take the good-for-nothing fellow from our house " The terrified father came in haste and scolded the boy  "What do these wicked tricks mean? They will only bring misfortune upon you Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her  The peasant woman, too, was quite willing  One day, therefore, he said to the woman, listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together', " I'll tell you what", ' On wednesday, you must take to your bed, and tell your husband you are ill, and as long as you complain and act being ill properly, and go on doing so until sunday when I have to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be, and makes a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where you can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother, the sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored to health immediately  I will manage it, said the woman promptly', " On the wednesday, therefore, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and lamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when sunday came the woman said, I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before my end - I should like to hear the parson's sermon that he is going to preach to-day", ' On that the peasant said, ah, my child, do not do it - you might make yourself worse if you were to get up  Look, I will hear the sermon, and will attend to it very carefully, and will tell you everything the parson says  Well, said the woman, go, then, and pay great attention, and repeat to me all that you hear  So the peasant heard the sermon, and the parson said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and would make a pilgimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might be, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer  Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant, and after the service was over, he went at once to the parson, who gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer  After that he went home, and even at the house door he cried, hurrah  Dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if you were well  The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would make a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I have already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and will at once begin my journey so that you may get well the faster, and thereupon he went away  He was hardly gone however before the woman got up, and the parson was there immediately  But now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the peasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to get the sooner to the gockerli hill, and on his way he met his gossip  His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming from the market, where he had sold his eggs  May you be blessed, said the gossip, where are you off to so fast', " To all eternity, my friend, said the peasant, my wife is ill, and I have been to-day to hear the parson's sermon, and he preached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and made a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother, the sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my pilgrimage", ' But listen, gossip, said the egg-merchant to the peasant, are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing as that', " Don't you know what it means", ' The parson wants to spend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given you this job to do to get you out of the way  My word, said the peasant', " How I'd like to know if that's true", " Come, then, said the gossip, I'll tell you what to do", ' Get into my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will see for yourself  So that was settled, and the gossip put the peasant into his egg-basket and carried him home  When they got to the house, hurrah  Everything was already very merry there There was once upon a time a king who had a daughter, and he caused a glass mountain to be made, and said that whosoever could cross to the other side of it without falling should have his daughter to wife', " Then there was one who loved the king's daughter, and he asked the king if he might have her", ' Yes, said the king, if you can cross the mountain without falling, you shall have her  And the princess said she would go over it with him, and would hold him if he were about to fall  So they set out together to go over it, and when they were half way up the princess slipped and fell, and the glass mountain opened and shut her up inside it, and her betrothed could not see where she had gone, for the mountain closed immediately  Then he wept and lamented much, and the king was miserable too, and ordered the mountain to be broken open where she had been lost, and thought he would be able to get her out again, but they could not find the place into which she had fallen', " Meanwhile the king's daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave", ' An old fellow with a very long gray beard came to meet her, and told her that if she would be his servant and do everything he bade her, she might live, if not he would kill her  So she did all he bade her  In the mornings he took his ladder out of his pocket, and set it up against the mountain and climbed to the top by its help, and then he drew the ladder after him  The princess had to cook his dinner, make his bed, and do all his work, and when he came home again he always brought with him a heap of gold and silver  When she had lived with him for many years, and had grown quite old, he called her mother mansrot, and she had to call him old rinkrank  Then once when he was out, and she had made his bed and washed his dishes, she shut the doors and windows all fast, and there was one little window through which the light shone in, and this she left open  When old rinkrank came home, he knocked at his door, and cried, mother mansrot, open the door for me  No, said she, old rinkrank, I will not open the door for you  Then he said,   here stand I, poor rinkrank,   on my seventeen long shanks,   on my weary, worn-out foot,   wash my dishes, mother mansrot  I have washed your dishes already, said she  Then again he said,   here stand I, poor rinkrank,   on my seventeen long shanks,   on my weary, worn-out foot,   make my bed, mother mansrot  I have made your bed already, said she  Then again he said,   here stand I, poor rinkrank,   on my seventeen long shanks,   on my weary, worn-out foot,   open the door, mother mansrot  Then he ran all round his house, and saw that the little window was open, and thought, I will look in and see what she can be about, and why she will not open the door for me  He tried to peep in, but could not get his head through because of his long beard  So he first put his beard through the open window, but just as he had got it through, mother mansrot came by and pulled the window down with a cord which she had tied to it, and his beard was shut fast in it  Then he began to cry most piteously, for it hurt him very much, and to entreat her to release him again  But she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain  Then, whether he would or not, he had to tell her where the ladder was  And she fastened a very long ribbon to the window, and then she set up the ladder, and ascended the mountain, and when she was at the top of it she opened the window  She went to her father, and told him all that had happened to her  The king rejoiced greatly, and her betrothed was still there, and they went and dug up the mountain, and found old rinkrank inside it with all his gold and silver  Then the king had old rinkrank put to death, and took all his gold and silver A farmer once had a faithful dog called sultan, who had grown old, and lost all his teeth, so that he could no longer hold on to anything  One day the farmer was standing with his wife before the house-door, and said, to-morrow I intend to shoot old sultan, he is no longer of any use  His wife, who felt pity for the faithful beast, answered, he has served us so long, and been so faithful, that we might well give him his keep  What, said the man, you are not very bright  He has not a tooth left in his head, and not a thief is afraid of him, now he can go  If he has served us, he has had good feeding for it  The poor dog, who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, had heard everything, and was sorry that the morrow was to be his last day  He had a good friend, the wolf, and he crept out in the evening into the forest to him, and complained of the fate that awaited him  Listen, gossip, said the wolf, be of good cheer, I will help you out of your trouble  I have thought of something  To-morrow, early in the morning, your master is going with his wife to make hay, and they will take their little child with them, for no one will be left behind in the house  They are wont, during work-time, to lay the child under the hedge in the shade, you lay yourself there too, just as if you wished to guard it  Then I will come out of the wood, and carry off the child  You must rush swiftly after me, as if you would seize it again from me  I will let it fall, and you will take it back to its parents, who will think that you have saved it, and will be far too grateful to do you any harm, on the contrary, you will be in high favor, and they will never let you want for anything again  The plan pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as it was arranged  The father screamed when he saw the wolf running across the field with his child, but when old sultan brought it back, then he was full of joy, and stroked him and said, not a hair of yours shall be hurt, you shall eat my bread free as long as you live  And to his wife he said, go home at once and make old sultan some bread-sop that he will not have to bite, and bring the pillow out of my bed, I will give him that to lie upon  Henceforth old sultan was as well off as he could wish to be  Soon afterwards the wolf visited him, and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well', " But, gossip, said he, you will just wink an eye if, when I have a chance, I carry off one of your master's fat sheep", ' Do not reckon upon that, answered the dog, I will remain true to my master, I cannot agree to that  The wolf, who thought that this could not be spoken in earnest, came creeping about in the night and was going to take away the sheep', " But the farmer, to whom the faithful sultan had told the wolf's plan, caught him and dressed his hide soundly with the flail", ' The wolf had to make himself scarce, but he cried out to the dog, wait a bit, you scoundrel, you shall pay for this  The next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge the dog to come out into the forest so that they might settle the affair  Old sultan could find no one to stand by him but a cat with only three legs, and as they went out together the poor cat limped along, and at the same time stretched out her tail into the air with pain  The wolf and his friend were already at the appointed place, but when they saw their enemy coming they thought that he was bringing a sabre with him, for they mistook the outstretched tail of the cat for one  And when the poor beast hopped on its three legs, they could only think every time that it was picking up a stone to throw at them  So they were both afraid, the wild boar crept into the under-wood and the wolf jumped up a tree  There is nobody in the world who knows so many stories as Ole-Luk-Oie, or who can relate them so nicely  In the evening, while the children are seated at the table or in their little chairs, he comes up the stairs very softly, for he walks in his socks, then he opens the doors without the slightest noise, and throws a small quantity of very fine dust in their eyes, just enough to prevent them from keeping them open, and so they do not see him  Then he creeps behind them, and blows softly upon their necks, till their heads begin to droop  But Ole-Luk-Oie does not wish to hurt them, for he is very fond of children, and only wants them to be quiet that he may relate to them pretty stories, and they never are quiet until they are in bed and asleep  As soon as they are asleep, Ole-Luk-Oie seats himself upon the bed  He is nicely dressed; his coat is made of silken stuff; it is impossible to say of what color, for it changes from green to red, and from red to blue as he turns from side to side  Under each arm he carries an umbrella; one of them, with pictures on the inside, he spreads over the good children, and then they dream the most beautiful stories the whole night  But the other umbrella has no pictures, and this he holds over the naughty children so that they sleep heavily, and wake in the morning without having dreamed at all  Now we shall hear how Ole-Luk-Oie came every night during a whole week to the little boy named Hjalmar, and what he told him  There were seven stories, as there are seven days in the week  MONDAY "Now pay attention," said Ole-Luk-Oie, in the evening, when Hjalmar was in bed, "and I will decorate the room " Immediately all the flowers in the flower-pots became large trees, with long branches reaching to the ceiling, and stretching along the walls, so that the whole room was like a greenhouse  All the branches were loaded with flowers, each flower as beautiful and as fragrant as a rose; and, had any one tasted them, he would have found them sweeter even than jam  The fruit glittered like gold, and there were cakes so full of plums that they were nearly bursting  It was incomparably beautiful', " At the same time sounded dismal moans from the table-drawer in which lay Hjalmar's school books", ' "What can that be now?" said Ole-Luk-Oie, going to the table and pulling out the drawer  It was a slate, in such distress because of a false number in the sum, that it had almost broken itself to pieces  The pencil pulled and tugged at its string as if it were a little dog that wanted to help, but could not', " And then came a moan from Hjalmar's copy-book", ' Oh, it was quite terrible to hear! On each leaf stood a row of capital letters, every one having a small letter by its side  This formed a copy; under these were other letters, which Hjalmar had written: they fancied they looked like the copy, but they were mistaken; for they were leaning on one side as if they intended to fall over the pencil-lines  "See, this is the way you should hold yourselves," said the copy  "Look here, you should slope thus, with a graceful curve " "Oh, we are very willing to do so, but we cannot," said Hjalmar\'s letters; "we are so wretchedly made " "You must be scratched out, then," said Ole-Luk-Oie  "Oh, no!" they cried, and then they stood up so gracefully it was quite a pleasure to look at them  "Now we must give up our stories, and exercise these letters," said Ole-Luk-Oie; "One, two--one, two--" So he drilled them till they stood up gracefully, and looked as beautiful as a copy could look  But after Ole-Luk-Oie was gone, and Hjalmar looked at them in the morning, they were as wretched and as awkward as ever  TUESDAY As soon as Hjalmar was in bed, Ole-Luk-Oie touched, with his little magic wand, all the furniture in the room, which immediately began to chatter, and each article only talked of itself There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was called One-Eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her forehead, and the second, Two-Eyes, because she had two eyes like other folks, and the youngest, Three-Eyes, because she had three eyes, and her third eye was also in the center of her forehead  However, as Two-Eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters and her mother could not endure her  They said to her, "You, with your two eyes, are no better than the common people, you do not belong to us " They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her, and gave her nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything that they could to make her unhappy  It came to pass that Two-Eyes had to go out into the fields and tend the goat, but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had given her so little to eat  So she sat down on a ridge and began to weep, and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes  And once when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing beside her, who said, "Why are you weeping, little Two-Eyes?" Two-Eyes answered, "Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes like other people, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push me from one corner to another, throw old clothes to me, and give me nothing to eat but the scraps they leave  Today they have given me so little that I am still quite hungry " Then the wise woman said, "Wipe away your tears, Two-Eyes, and I will tell you something to stop your ever suffering from hunger again', " Just say to your goat - \t `Bleat, my little goat, bleat, \t Cover the table with something to eat,' and then a clean well-spread little table will stand before you with the most delicious food upon it of which you may eat as much as you are inclined for, and when you have had enough, and have no more need of the little table, just say, \t `Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, \t and take the table quite away,' and then it will vanish again from your sight", '" Hereupon the wise woman departed  But Two-Eyes thought, "I must instantly make a trial, and see if what she said is true, for I am far too hungry," and she said - \t "Bleat, my little goat, bleat, \t Cover the table with something to eat," and scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife and fork, and a silver spoon, and the most delicious food was there also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen  Then Two-Eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, "Lord God, be our guest forever, amen," and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it  And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman had taught her - \t "Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, \t And take the table quite away," and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again  That is a delightful way of keeping house, thought Two-Eyes, and was quite glad and happy  In the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small earthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for her, but she did not touch it  Next day she again went out with her goat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to her, lying untouched  The first and second time that she did this, her sisters did not notice it at all, but as it happened every time, they did observe it, and said, "There is something wrong about Two-Eyes, she always leaves her food untasted, and she used to eat up everything that was given her, she must have discovered other ways of getting food " In order that they might learn the truth, they resolved to send One-Eye with Two-Eyes when she went to drive her goat to the pasture, to observe what Two-Eyes did when she was there, and whether anyone brought her anything to eat and drink  So when Two-Eyes set out the next time, One-Eye went to her and said, "I will go with you to the pasture, and see that the goat is well taken care of, and driven where there is food " But Two-Eyes knew what was in One-Eye\'s mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, "Come, One-Eye, we will sit down, and I will sing something to you " One-Eye sat down and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and the heat of the sun, and Two-Eyes sang constantly - \t "One-eye, are you waking? \t One-eye, are you sleeping?" Until One-Eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-Eyes saw that One-Eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said, \t "Bleat, my little goat, bleat, \t Cover the table with something to eat," and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was satisfied, and then she again cried - \t "Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, \t And take the table quite away," and in an instant all had vanished  Two-Eyes now awakened One-Eye, and said, "One-Eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, but in the meantime the goat might run all over the world  Come, let us go home again " So they went home, and again Two-Eyes let her dish stand untouched, and One-Eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, "I fell asleep when I was out " Next day the mother said to Three-Eyes, this time you shall go and observe if Two-Eyes eats anything when she is out, and if anyone fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret  So Three-Eyes went to Two-Eyes, and said, "I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food " But Two-Eyes knew what was in Three-Eyes\' mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, "We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-Eyes " Three-Eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-Eyes began the same song as before, and sang - \t "Three-Eyes, are you waking?" But then, instead of singing - \t "Three-Eyes, are you sleeping?" As she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang - \t "Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?" And sang all the time - \t "Three-Eyes, are you waking? \t Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?" Then two of the eyes which Three-Eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep  It is true that three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well Hard by a great forest dwelt a wood-cutter with his wife, who had an only child, a little girl three years old  They were so poor, however, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to get food for her', " One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him 'I am the virgin mary, mother of the child jesus", ' You are poor and needy, bring your child to me, I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her', "' The wood-cutter obeyed, brought his child, and gave her to the virgin mary, who took her up to heaven with her", ' There the child fared well, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of gold, and the little angels played with her', " And when she was fourteen years of age, the virgin mary called her one day and said 'dear child, I am about to make a long journey, so take into your keeping the keys of the thirteen doors of heaven", ' Twelve of these you may open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden you  Take care not to open it, or you will be unhappy', "' The girl promised to be obedient, and when the virgin mary was gone, she began to examine the dwellings of the kingdom of heaven", ' Each day she opened one of them, until she had made the round of the twelve  In each of them sat one of the apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendor, and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her', " Then the forbidden door alone remained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden behind it, and said to the angels 'I will not open it entirely, and I will not go inside, but I will unlock it so that we can see just a little through the opening", "' 'Oh'no, said the little angels, 'that would be a sin", ' The virgin mary has forbidden it, and it might easily cause your unhappiness', "' Then she was silent, but the desire in her heart was not stilled, but gnawed there and tormented her, and let her have no rest", " And once when the angels had all gone out, she thought 'now I am quite alone, and I could peep in", ' If I do, no one will ever know', "' She sought out the key, and when she had got it in her hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she turned it round as well", ' Then the door sprang open, and she saw there the trinity sitting in fire and splendor  She stayed there awhile, and looked at everything in amazement, then she touched the light a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden  Immediately a great fear fell on her  She shut the door violently, and ran hi there', " But her terror would not quit her, let her do what she 'Yes, said the girl, for the second time", " Then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and saw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time 'have you not done it", "' 'No, said the girl for the third time", " Then said the virgin mary 'you have not obeyed me, and besides that you have lied, you are no longer worthy to be in heaven", "' Then the girl fell into a deep sleep, and when she awoke she lay on the earth below, and in the midst of a wilderness", ' She wanted to cry out, but she could bring forth no sound  She sprang up and wanted to run away, but whithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break  Once upon a time there lived a king and a queen who had one son  The king loved the boy very much, but the queen, who was a wicked woman, hated the sight of him; and this was the more unlucky for, when he was twelve years old, his father died, and he was left alone in the world  Now the queen was very angry because the people, who knew how bad she was, seated her son on the throne instead of herself, and she never rested till she had formed a plan to get him out of the way  Fortunately, however, the young king was wise and prudent, and knew her too well to trust her  One day, when his mourning was over, he gave orders that everything should be made ready for a grand hunt  The queen pretended to be greatly delighted that he was going to amuse himself once more, and declared that she would accompany him', " 'No, mother, I cannot let you come,' he answered; 'the ground is rough, and you are not strong", "' But he might as well have spoken to the winds: when the horn was sounded at daybreak the queen was there with the rest", ' All that day they rode, for game was plentiful, but towards evening the mother and son found themselves alone in a part of the country that was strange to them  They wandered on for some time, without knowing where they were going, till they met with a man whom they begged to give them shelter', " 'Come with me,' said the man gladly, for he was an ogre, and fed on human flesh; and the king and his mother went with him, and he led them to his house", ' When they got there they found to what a dreadful place they had come, and, falling on their knees, they offered him great sums of money, if he would only spare their lives', " The ogre's heart was moved at the sight of the queen's beauty, and he promised that he would do her no harm; but he stabbed the boy at once, and binding his body on a horse, turned him loose in the forest", ' The ogre had happened to choose a horse which he had bought only the day before, and he did not know it was a magician, or he would not have been so foolish as to fix upon it on this occasion', " The horse no sooner had been driven off with the prince's body on its back than it galloped straight to the home of the fairies, and knocked at the door with its hoof", ' The fairies heard the knock, but were afraid to open till they had peeped from an upper window to see that it was no giant or ogre who could do them harm', " 'Oh, look, sister!' cried the first to reach the window, 'it is a horse that has knocked, and on its back there is bound a dead boy, the most beautiful boy in all the world!' Then the fairies ran to open the door, and let in the horse and unbound the ropes which fastened the young king on its back", " And they gathered round to admire his beauty, and whispered one to the other: 'We will make him alive again, and will keep him for our brother", "' And so they did, and for many years they all lived together as brothers and sisters", " By-and-by the boy grew into a man, as boys will, and then the oldest of the fairies said to her sisters: 'Now I will marry him, and he shall be really your brother", "' So the young king married the fairy, and they lived happily together in the castle; but though he loved his wife he still longed to see the world", " At length this longing grew so strong on him that he could bear it no more; and, calling the fairies together, he said to them: 'Dear wife and sisters, I must leave you for a time, and go out and see the world", ' But I shall think of you often, and one day I shall come back to you', "' The fairies wept and begged him to stay, but he would not listen, and at last the eldest, who was his wife, said to him: 'If you really will abandon us, take this lock of my hair with you; you will find it useful in time of need", "' So she cut off a long curl, and handed it to him", ' The prince mounted his horse, and rode on all day without stopping once  Towards evening he found himself in a desert, and, look where he would, there was no such thing as a house or a man to be seen', " 'What am I to do now?' he thought", " 'If I go to sleep here wild beasts will come and eat me! Yet both I and my horse are worn out, and can go no further", "' Then suddenly he remembered the fairy's gift, and taking out the curl he said to it: 'I want a castle here, and servants, and dinner, and everything to make me comfortable tonight; and besides that, I must have a stable and fodder for my horse" ,  ' There once lived in Denmark a peasant and his wife who owned a very good farm, but had no children  They often lamented to each other that they had no one of their own to inherit all the wealth that they possessed  They continued to prosper, and became rich people, but there was no heir to it all  One year it happened that they owned a pretty little bull-calf, which they called Peter  It was the prettiest little creature they had ever seen--so beautiful and so wise that it understood everything that was said to it, and so gentle and so full of play that both the man and his wife came to be as fond of it as if it had been their own child', " One day the man said to his wife, 'I wonder, now, whether our parish clerk could teach Peter to talk; in that case we could not do better than adopt him as our son, and let him inherit all that we possess", "' 'Well, I don't know,' said his wife, 'our clerk is tremendously learned, and knows much more than his Paternoster, and I could almost believe that he might be able to teach Peter to talk, for Peter has a wonderfully good head too", ' You might at least ask him about it', "' Off went the man to the clerk, and asked him whether he thought he could teach a bull-calf that they had to speak, for they wished so much to have it as their heir", " The clerk was no fool; he looked round about to see that no one could overhear them, and said, 'Oh, yes, I can easily do that, but you must not speak to anyone about it", ' It must be done in all secrecy, and the priest must not know of it, otherwise I shall get into trouble, as it is forbidden  It will also cost you something, as some very expensive books are required', "' That did not matter at all, the man said; they would not care so very much what it cost", ' The clerk could have a hundred dollars to begin with to buy the books  He also promised to tell no one about it, and to bring the calf round in the evening  He gave the clerk the hundred dollars on the spot, and in the evening took the calf round to him, and the clerk promised to do his best with it', " In a week's time he came back to the clerk to hear about the calf and see how it was thriving", ' The clerk, however, said that he could not get a sight of it, for then Peter would long after him and forget all that he had already learned  He was getting on well with his learning, but another hundred dollars were needed, as they must have more books  The peasant had the money with him, so he gave it to the clerk, and went home again with high hopes  In another week the man came again to learn what progress Peter had made now', " 'He is getting on very well,' said the clerk", " 'I suppose he can't say anything yet?' said the man", ' \'Oh, yes,\' said the clerk, \'he can say "Moo" now', "' 'Do you think he will get on with his learning?' asked the peasant", " 'Oh, yes,' said the clerk, 'but I shall want another hundred dollars for books", " Peter can't learn well out of the ones that he has got", "' 'Well, well,' said the man, 'what must be spent shall be spent", "' So he gave the clerk the third hundred dollars for books, and a cask of good old ale for Peter", ' The clerk drank the ale himself, and gave the calf milk, which he thought would be better for it  Long, long ago there lived a widow who had three sons  The two eldest were grown up, and though they were known to be idle fellows, some of the neighbours had given them work to do on account of the respect in which their mother was held  But at the time this story begins they had both been so careless and idle that their masters declared they would keep them no longer  So home they went to their mother and youngest brother, of whom they thought little, because he made himself useful about the house, and looked after the hens, and milked the cow', " 'Pinkel,' they called him in scorn, and by-and-by 'Pinkel' became his name throughout the village", ' The two young men thought it was much nicer to live at home and be idle than to be obliged to do a quantity of disagreeable things they did not like, and they would have stayed by the fire till the end of their lives had not the widow lost patience with them and said that since they would not look for work at home they must seek it elsewhere, for she would not have them under her roof any longer  But she repented bitterly of her words when Pinkel told her that he too was old enough to go out into the world, and that when he had made a fortune he would send for his mother to keep house for him  The widow wept many tears at parting from her youngest son, but as she saw that his heart was set upon going with his brothers, she did not try to keep him  So the young men started off one morning in high spirits, never doubting that work such as they might be willing to do would be had for the asking, as soon as their little store of money was spent  But a very few days of wandering opened their eyes  Nobody seemed to want them, or, if they did, the young men declared that they were not able to undertake all that the farmers or millers or woodcutters required of them  The youngest brother, who was wiser, would gladly have done some of the work that the others refused, but he was small and slight, and no one thought of offering him any  Therefore they went from one place to another, living only on the fruit and nuts they could find in the woods, and getting hungrier every day  One night, after they had been walking for many hours and were very tired, they came to a large lake with an island in the middle of it  From the island streamed a strong light, by which they could see everything almost as clearly as if the sun had been shining, and they perceived that, lying half hidden in the rushes, was a boat', " 'Let us take it and row over to the island, where there must be a house,' said the eldest brother; 'and perhaps they will give us food and shelter", "' And they all got in and rowed across in the direction of the light", ' As they drew near the island they saw that it came from a golden lantern hanging over the door of a hut, while sweet tinkling music proceeded from some bells attached to the golden horns of a goat which was feeding near the cottage', " The young men's hearts rejoiced as they thought that at last they would be able to rest their weary limbs, and they entered the hut, but were amazed to see an ugly old woman inside, wrapped in a cloak of gold which lighted up the whole house", ' They looked at each other uneasily as she came forward with her daughter, as they knew by the cloak that this was a famous witch', " 'What do you want?' asked she, at the same time signing to her daughter to stir the large pot on the fire", " 'We are tired and hungry, and would fain have shelter for the night,' answered the eldest brother", " 'You cannot get it here,' said the witch, 'but you will find both food and shelter in the palace on the other side of the lake", ' Take your boat and go; but leave this boy with me--I can find work for him, though something tells me he is quick and cunning, and will do me ill', "' 'What harm can a poor boy like me do a great Troll like you?' answered Pinkel", " 'Let me go, I pray you, with my brothers", ' I will promise never to hurt you', "' And at last the witch let him go, and he followed his brothers to the boat", ' The way was further than they thought, and it was morning before they reached the palace', " Now, at last, their luck seemed to have turned, for while the two eldest were given places in the king's stables, Pinkel was taken as page to the little prince" ,  ' When birds were men, and men were birds, Pivi and Kabo lived in an island far away, called New Claledonia  Pivi was a cheery little bird that chirps at sunset; Kabo was an ugly black fowl that croaks in the darkness  One day Pivi and Kabo thought that they would make slings, and practice slinging, as the people of the island still do  So they went to a banyan tree, and stripped the bark to make strings for their slings, and next they repaired to the river bank to find stones  Kabo stood on the bank of the river, and Pivi went into the water  The game was for Kabo to sling at Pivi, and for Pivi to dodge the stones, if he could', " For some time he dodged them cleverly, but at last a stone from Kabo's sling hit poor Pivi on the leg and broke it", ' Down went Pivi into the stream, and floated along it, till he floated into a big hollow bamboo, which a woman used for washing her sweet potatoes', " 'What is that in my bamboo?' said the woman", ' And she blew in at one end, and blew little Pivi out at the other, like a pea from a pea-shooter', " 'Oh!' cried the woman, 'what a state you are in! What have you been doing?' 'It was Kabo who broke my leg at the slinging game,' said Pivi", " 'Well, I am sorry for you,' said the woman; 'will you come with me, and do what I tell you?' 'I will!' said Pivi, for the woman was very kind and pretty", ' She took Pivi into a shed where she kept her fruit laid him on a bed of mats, and made him as comfortable as she could, and attended to his broken leg without cutting off the flesh round the bone, as these people usually do', " 'You will be still, won't you, Pivi?' she said", " 'If you hear a little noise you will pretend to be dead", ' It is the Black Ant who will come and creep from your feet up to your head', " Say nothing, and keep quiet, won't you, Pivi?' 'Certainly, kind lady,' said Pivi, 'I will lie as still as can be", "' 'Next will come the big Red Ant--you know him?' 'Yes, I know him, with his feet like a grasshopper's", "' 'He will walk over your body up to your head", ' Then you must shake all your body', " Do you understand, Pivi?' 'Yes, dear lady, I shall do just as you say", "' 'Very good,' said the woman, going out and shutting the door", ' Pivi lay still under his coverings, then a tiny noise was heard, and the Black Ant began to march over Pivi, who lay quite still  Then came the big Red Ant skipping along his body, and then Pivi shook himself all over', " He jumped up quite well again, he ran to the river, he looked into the water and saw that he was changed from a bird into a fine young man! 'Oh, lady,' he cried, 'look at me now! I am changed into a man, and so handsome!' 'Will you obey me again?' said the woman", " 'Always; whatever you command I will do it,' said Pivi, politely", " 'Then climb up that cocoa-nut tree, with your legs only, not using your hands,' said the woman", ' Now the natives can run up cocoa-nut trees like squirrels, some using only one hand; the girls can do that  But few can climb without using their hands at all', " 'At the top of the tree you will find two cocoa-nuts" ,  ' Poultry Meg was the only person who lived in the new stately dwelling that had been built for the fowls and ducks belonging to the manor house  It stood there where once the old knightly building had stood with its tower, its pointed gables, its moat, and its drawbridge  Close by it was a wilderness of trees and thicket; here the garden had been, and had stretched out to a great lake, which was now moorland  Crows and choughs flew screaming over the old trees, and there were crowds of birds; they did not seem to get fewer when any one shot among them, but seemed rather to increase  One heard the screaming into the poultry-house, where Poultry Meg sat with the ducklings running to and fro over her wooden shoes  She knew every fowl and every duck from the moment it crept out of the shell; and she was fond of her fowls and her ducks, and proud of the stately house that had been built for them  Her own little room in the house was clean and neat, for that was the wish of the gracious lady to whom the house belonged  She often came in the company of grand noble guests, to whom she showed "the hens\' and ducks\' barracks," as she called the little house  Here were a clothes cupboard, and an arm-chair, and even a chest of drawers; and on these drawers a polished metal plate had been placed, whereon was engraved the word "Grubbe," and this was the name of the noble family that had lived in the house of old  The brass plate had been found when they were digging the foundation; and the clerk has said it had no value except in being an old relic  The clerk knew all about the place, and about the old times, for he had his knowledge from books, and many a memorandum had been written and put in his table-drawer', " But the oldest of the crows perhaps knew more than he, and screamed it out in her own language; but that was the crow's language, and the clerk did not understand that, clever as he was", ' After the hot summer days the mist sometimes hung over the moorland as if a whole lake were behind the old trees, among which the crows and the daws were fluttering; and thus it had looked when the good Knight Grubbe had lived here--when the old manor house stood with its thick red walls  The dog-chain used to reach in those days quite over the gateway; through the tower one went into a paved passage which led to the rooms; the windows were narrow, and the panes were small, even in the great hall where the dancing used to be; but in the time of the last Grubbe, there had been no dancing in the hall within the memory of man, although an old drum still lay there that had served as part of the music  Here stood a quaintly carved cupboard, in which rare flower-roots were kept, for my Lady Grubbe was fond of plants and cultivated trees and shrubs  Her husband preferred riding out to shoot wolves and boars; and his little daughter Marie always went with him part of the way  When she was only five years old, she would sit proudly on her horse, and look saucily round with her great black eyes  It was a great amusement to her to hit out among the hunting-dogs with her whip; but her father would rather have seen her hit among the peasant boys, who came running up to stare at their lord  The peasant in the clay hut close by the knightly house had a son named Soren, of the same age as the gracious little lady', " The boy could climb well, and had always to bring her down the bird's nests", ' The birds screamed as loud as they could, and one of the greatest of them hacked him with its beak over the eye so that the blood ran down, and it was at first thought the eye had been destroyed; but it had not been injured after all', " Marie Grubbe used to call him her Soren, and that was a great favor, and was an advantage to Soren's father--poor Jon, who had one day committed a fault, and was to be punished by riding on the wooden horse", ' This same horse stood in the courtyard, and had four poles for legs, and a single narrow plant for a back; on this Jon had to ride astride, and some heavy bricks were fastened to his feet into the bargain, that he might not sit too comfortably  He made horrible grimaces, and Soren wept and implored little Marie to interfere', " She immediately ordered that Soren's father should be taken down, and when they did not obey her, she stamped on the floor, and pulled at her father's sleeve till it was torn to pieces", " She would have her way, and she got her way, and Soren's father was taken down", " Lady Grubbe, who now came up, parted her little daughter's hair from the child's brow, and looked at her affectionately; but Marie did not understand why", ' She wanted to go to the hounds, and not to her mother, who went down into the garden, to the lake where the water-lily bloomed, and the heads of bulrushes nodded amid the reeds; and she looked at all this beauty and freshness  "How pleasant!" she said  In the garden stood at that time a rare tree, which she herself had planted' ,  "There was once a king's son who went out into the world, and he was full of thought and sad", ' He looked at the sky, which was so beautifully pure and blue, then he sighed, and said, how well must all be with one up there in heaven  Then he saw a poor gray-haired man who was coming along the road towards him, and he spoke to him, and asked, how can I get to heaven  The man answered, by poverty and humility  Put on my ragged clothes, wander about the world for seven years, and get to know what misery is, take no money, but if you are hungry ask compassionate hearts for a bit of bread  In this way you will reach heaven', " Then the king's son took off his magnificent coat, and wore in its place the beggar's garment, went out into the wide world, and suffered great misery", ' He took nothing but a little food, said nothing, but prayed to the Lord to take him into his heaven', " When the seven years were over, he returned to his father's palace, but no one recognized him", ' He said to the servants, go and tell my parents that I have come back again  But the servants did not believe it, and laughed and left him standing there  Then said he, go and tell it to my brothers that they may come down, for I should so like to see them again', " The servants would not do that either, but at last one of them went, and told it to the king's children, but these did not believe it, and did not trouble themselves about it", ' Then he wrote a letter to his mother, and described to her all his misery, but he did not say that he was her son  So out of pity, the queen had a place under the stairs assigned to him, and food taken to him daily by two servants  But one of them was ill-natured and said, why should the beggar have the good food, and kept it for himself, or gave it to the dogs, and took the weak, emaciated beggar nothing but water  The other, however, was honest, and took the beggar what was sent to him  It was little, but he could live on it for a while, and all the time he was quite patient, but he grew continually weaker  As his illness increased, he desired to receive the last sacrament  When the mass was being celebrated, all the bells in the town and neighborhood began to ring of their own accord  After mass the priest went to the poor man under the stairs, and there he lay dead  In one hand he had a rose, in the other a lily, and beside him was a paper on which was written his history  When he was buried, a rose grew on one side of his grave, and a lily on the other    In a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants, who always went about together  Once upon a time they had travelled far afield, and were returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained by selling their wares  Now there happened to be a dense forest near their village, and this they reached early one morning  In it there lived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had never heard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stood before them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered them to lay down all they had  The traders had no weapons with them, and so, though they were many more in number, they had to submit themselves to the robbers, who took away everything from them, even the very clothes they wore, and gave to each only a small loin-cloth a span in breadth and a cubit in length', " The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their property, now took possession of the robbers' minds", ' They seated themselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, and ordered them to dance to them before returning home  The merchants now mourned their fate  They had lost all they had, except their loin-cloth, and still the robbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to dance  There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever  He pondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the dance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in which the three robbers had seated themselves on the grass  At the same time he observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, in the assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were now commencing to dance  So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a song is always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keep time with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:   "We are enty men,   They are erith men:   If each erith man,   Surround eno men   Eno man remains    _Ta, tai, tom, tadingana _" The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merely singing a song as usual  So it was in one sense; for the leader commenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before he and his companions commenced to approach the robbers  They had understood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade  When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a purchaser, they use a riddling sort of language   "What is the price of this cloth?" one trader will ask another  "Enty rupees," another will reply, meaning "ten rupees " Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant unless he be acquainted with trade language  By the rules of this secret language erith means "three," enty means "ten," and eno means "one " So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-traders that they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pounced upon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while the remaining one bound the robbers\' hands and feet   The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understanding the meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudly seated chewing betel and tobacco  Meanwhile the song was sung a third time  _Ta tai tom_ had left the lips of the singer; and, before _tadingana_ was out of them, the traders separated into parties of three, and each party pounced upon a thief  The remaining one--the leader himself--tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth, six cubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers  These were entirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three bags of rice! The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselves with the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reached their village, they often amused their friends and relatives by relating their adventure      Once upon a time, very long ago, there was a little Prince Ivan who was dumb  Never a word had he spoken from the day that he was born--not so much as a "Yes" or a "No," or a "Please" or a "Thank you " A great sorrow he was to his father because he could not speak  Indeed, neither his father nor his mother could bear the sight of him, for they thought, "A poor sort of Tzar will a dumb boy make!" They even prayed, and said, "If only we could have another child, whatever it is like, it could be no worse than this tongue-tied brat who cannot say a word " And for that wish they were punished, as you shall hear  And they took no sort of care of the little Prince Ivan, and he spent all his time in the stables, listening to the tales of an old groom  He was a wise man was the old groom, and he knew the past and the future, and what was happening under the earth  Maybe he had learnt his wisdom from the horses  Anyway, he knew more than other folk, and there came a day when he said to Prince Ivan,-- "Little Prince," says he, "to-day you have a sister, and a bad one at that', " She has come because of your father's prayers and your mother's wishes", ' A witch she is, and she will grow like a seed of corn', " In six weeks she'll be a grown witch, and with her iron teeth she will eat up your father, and eat up your mother, and eat up you too, if she gets the chance", " There's no saving the old people; but if you are quick, and do what I tell you, you may escape, and keep your soul in your body", ' And I love you, my little dumb Prince, and do not wish to think of your little body between her iron teeth  You must go to your father and ask him for the best horse he has, and then gallop like the wind, and away to the end of the world " The little Prince ran off and found his father', " There was his father, and there was his mother, and a little baby girl was in his mother's arms, screaming like a little fury", ' "Well, she\'s not dumb," said his father, as if he were well pleased  "Father," says the little Prince, "may I have the fastest horse in the stable?" And those were the first words that ever left his mouth  "What!" says his father, "have you got a voice at last? Yes, take whatever horse you want  And see, you have a little sister; a fine little girl she is too  She has teeth already', " It's a pity they are black, but time will put that right, and it's better to have black teeth than to be born dumb", '" Little Prince Ivan shook in his shoes when he heard of the black teeth of his little sister, for he knew that they were iron  He thanked his father and ran off to the stable  The old groom saddled the finest horse there was  Such a horse you never saw  Black it was, and its saddle and bridle were trimmed with shining silver  And little Prince Ivan climbed up and sat on the great black horse, and waved his hand to the old groom, and galloped away, on and on over the wide world  "It\'s a big place, this world," thought the little Prince  Once upon a time there was a King and his Queen in their kingdom  They had one daughter, who was called Ingiborg, and one son, whose name was Ring  He was less fond of adventures than men of rank usually were in those days, and was not famous for strength or feats of arms  When he was twelve years old, one fine winter day he rode into the forest along with his men to enjoy himself  They went on a long way, until they caught sight of a hind with a gold ring on its horns  The Prince was eager to catch it, if possible, so they gave chase and rode on without stopping until all the horses began to founder beneath them', " At last the Prince's horse gave way too, and then there came over them a darkness so black that they could no longer see the hind", ' By this time they were far away from any house, and thought it was high time to be making their way home again, but they found they had got lost now  At first they all kept together, but soon each began to think that he knew the right way best; so they separated, and all went in different directions  The Prince, too, had got lost like the rest, and wandered on for a time until he came to a little clearing in the forest not far from the sea, where he saw a woman sitting on a chair and a big barrel standing beside her  The Prince went up to her and saluted her politely, and she received him very graciously  He looked down into the barrel then, and saw lying at the bottom an unusually beautiful gold ring, which pleased him so much that he could not take his eyes off it  The woman saw this, and said that he might have it if he would take the trouble to get it; for which the Prince thanked her, and said it was at least worth trying  So he leaned over into the barrel, which did not seem very deep, and thought he would easily reach the ring; but the more he stretched down after it the deeper grew the barrel  As he was thus bending down into it the woman suddenly rose up and pushed him in head first, saying that now he could take up his quarters there  Then she fixed the top on the barrel and threw it out into the sea  The Prince thought himself in a bad plight now, as he felt the barrel floating out from the land and tossing about on the waves  How many days he spent thus he could not tell, but at last he felt that the barrel was knocking against rocks, at which he was a little cheered, thinking it was probably land and not merely a reef in the sea  Being something of a swimmer, he at last made up his mind to kick the bottom out of the barrel, and having done so he was able to get on shore, for the rocks by the sea were smooth and level; but overhead there were high cliffs  It seemed difficult to get up these, but he went along the foot of them for a little, till at last he tried to climb up, which at last he did  Having got to the top, he looked round about him and saw that he was on an island, which was covered with forest, with apples growing, and altogether pleasant as far as the land was concerned  After he had been there several days, he one day heard a great noise in the forest, which made him terribly afraid, so that he ran to hide himself among the trees  Then he saw a Giant approaching, dragging a sledge loaded with wood, and making straight for him, so that he could see nothing for it but to lie down just where he was  When the Giant came across him, he stood still and looked at the Prince for a little; then he took him up in his arms and carried him home to his house, and was exceedingly kind to him  He gave him to his wife, saying he had found this child in the wood, and she could have it to help her in the house  The old woman was greatly pleased, and began to fondle the Prince with the utmost delight  He stayed there with them, and was very willing and obedient to them in everything, while they grew kinder to him every day  One day the Giant took him round and showed him all his rooms except the parlour; this made the Prince curious to have a look into it, thinking there must be some very rare treasure there  So one day, when the Giant had gone into the forest, he tried to get into the parlour, and managed to get the door open half-way  Then he saw that some living creature moved inside and ran along the floor towards him and said something, which made him so frightened that he sprang back from the door and shut it again  Once upon a time there lived a young king whose name was Souci, and he had been brought up, ever since he was a baby, by the fairy Inconstancy  Now the fairy Girouette had a kind heart, but she was a very trying person to live with, for she never knew her own mind for two minutes together, and as she was the sole ruler at Court till the prince grew up everything was always at sixes and sevens  At first she determined to follow the old custom of keeping the young king ignorant of the duties he would have to perform some day; then, quite suddenly, she resigned the reins of government into his hands; but, unluckily, it was too late to train him properly for the post', " However, the fairy did not think of that, but, carried away by her new ideas, she hastily formed a Council, and named as Prime Minister the excellent 'Ditto,' so called because he had never been known to contradict anybody", ' Young Prince Souci had a handsome face, and at the bottom a good deal of common sense; but he had never been taught good manners, and was shy and awkward; and had, besides, never learned how to use his brains  Under these circumstances it is not surprising that the Council did not get through much work  Indeed, the affairs of the country fell into such disorder that at last the people broke out into open rebellion, and it was only the courage of the king, who continued to play the flute while swords and spears were flashing before the palace gate, that prevented civil war from being declared', " No sooner was the revolt put down than the Council turned their attention to the question of the young king's marriage", ' Various princesses were proposed to him, and the fairy, who was anxious to get the affair over before she left the Court for ever, gave it as her opinion that the Princess Diaphana would make the most suitable wife', " Accordingly envoys were sent to bring back an exact report of the princess's looks and ways, and they returned saying that she was tall and well made, but so very light that the equerries who accompanied her in her walks had to be always watching her, lest she should suddenly be blown away", ' This had happened so often that her subjects lived in terror of losing her altogether, and tried everything they could think of to keep her to the ground  They even suggested that she should carry weights in her pockets, or have them tied to her ankles; but this idea was given up, as the princess found it so uncomfortable  At length it was decided that she was never to go out in a wind, and in order to make matters surer still the equerries each held the end of a string which was fastened to her waist  The Council talked over this report for some days, and then the king made up his mind that he would judge for himself, and pretend to be his own ambassador  This plan was by no means new, but it had often succeeded, and, anyhow, they could think of nothing better  Such a splendid embassy had never before been seen in any country', " The kingdom was left in the charge of the Prime Minister, who answered 'Ditto' to everything; but the choice was better than it seemed, for the worthy man was much beloved by the people, as he agreed with all they said, and they left him feeling very pleased with themselves and their own wisdom", " When the king arrived at Diaphana's Court he found a magnificent reception awaiting him, for, though they pretended not to know who he was, secrets like this are never hidden", ' Now the young king had a great dislike to long ceremonies, so he proposed that his second interview with the princess should take place in the garden', " The princess made some difficulties, but, as the weather was lovely and very still, she at last consented to the king's wishes", ' But no sooner had they finished their first bows and curtseys than a slight breeze sprung up, and began to sway the princess, whose equerries had retired out of respect  The king went forward to steady her, but the wind that he caused only drove her further away from him', " He rushed after her exclaiming, 'O princess! are you really running away from me?' 'Good gracious, no!' she replied", " 'Run a little quicker and you will be able to stop me, and I shall be for ever grateful", " That is what comes of talking in a garden,' she added in disgust; 'as if one wasn't much better in a room that was tightly closed all round", "' The king ran as fast as he could, but the wind ran faster still, and in a moment the princess was whirled to the bottom of the garden, which was bounded by a ditch", ' She cleared it like a bird, and the king, who was obliged to stop short at the edge, saw the lovely Diaphana flying over the plain, sometimes driven to the right, sometimes to the left, till at last she vanished out of sight  By this time the whole court were running over the plain, some on foot and some on horseback, all hurrying to the help of their princess, who really was in some danger, for the wind was rising to the force of a gale  The king looked on for a little, and then returned with his attendants to the palace, reflecting all the while on the extreme lightness of his proposed bride and the absurdity of having a wife that rose in the air better than any kite  He thought on the whole that it would be wiser not to wait longer, but to depart at once, and he started on horseback at the very moment when the princess had been found by her followers, wet to the skin, and blown against a rick  Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters  They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more clever than the rest', " The Raja's wife died when they were quite little children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them", " The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of the nation", " About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth", ' Then Balna used to say to her sisters, "Send that woman away; send her away  Let her get the fire at her own house  What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come here, we shall suffer for it some day " But the other sisters would answer, "Be quiet, Balna; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if she likes " Then the Prudhan\'s widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the Raja\'s dinner  Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters', " Ever since their mother's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies", ' So, when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days  At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them through a hole in the wall  There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be cooked', " Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with", ' Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, "Why don\'t you keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters, don\'t give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself " Then the eldest sister answered, "Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us no harm " But Balna replied, "If you let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us sorry for it, some day " The Raja then saw the Prudhan\'s widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of the dishes  At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him  But when the widow came, she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace  Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her, she did all she could to make them miserable  She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother\'s tomb and cry--and say: "Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?" One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to their mother\'s grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree  Then the Ranee said to her daughter, "I cannot tell how it is, every day those seven girls say they don\'t want any dinner, and won\'t eat any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do  I cannot tell how it is " And she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat', " So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them gathering the fruit", ' Then Balna said to her sisters, "Do you not see that girl watching us? Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us " But the other sisters said, "Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna  Once there lived a great Raja, whose name was Salabhan, and he had a Queen, by name Lona, who, though she wept and prayed at many a shrine, had never a child to gladden her eyes  After a long time, however, a son was promised to her  Queen Lona returned to the palace, and when the time for the birth of the promised son drew nigh, she inquired of three Jogis who came begging to her gate, what the child\'s fate would be, and the youngest of them answered and said, "Oh, Queen! the child will be a boy, and he will live to be a great man  But for twelve years you must not look upon his face, for if either you or his father see it before the twelve years are past, you will surely die! This is what you must do; as soon as the child is born you must send him away to a cellar underneath the ground, and never let him see the light of day for twelve years  After they are over, he may come forth, bathe in the river, put on new clothes, and visit you  His name shall be Raja Rasalu, and he shall be known far and wide " So, when a fair young Prince was in due time born into the world, his parents hid him away in an underground palace, with nurses, and servants, and everything else a King\'s son might desire  And with him they sent a young colt, born the same day, and sword, spear, and shield, against the day when Raja Rasalu should go forth into the world', " So there the child lived, playing with his colt, and talking to his parrot, while the nurses taught him all things needful for a King's son to know", " Young Rasalu lived on, far from the light of day, for eleven long years, growing tall and strong, yet contented to remain playing with his colt, and talking to his parrot; but when the twelfth year began, the lad's heart leapt up with desire for change, and he loved to listen to the sounds of life which came to him in his palace-prison from the outside world", ' "I must go and see where the voices come from!" he said; and when his nurses told him he must not go for one year more, he only laughed aloud, saying, "Nay! I stay no longer here for any man!" Then he saddled his Arab horse Bhaunr, put on his shining armour, and rode forth into the world; but mindful of what his nurses had oft told him, when he came to the river, he dismounted, and, going into the water, washed himself and his clothes', " Then, clean of raiment, fair of face, and brave of heart, he rode on his way until he reached his father's city", ' There he sat down to rest awhile by a well, where the women were drawing water in earthen pitchers  Now, as they passed him, their full pitchers poised upon their heads, the gay young Prince flung stones at the earthen vessels, and broke them all  Then the women, drenched with water, went weeping and wailing to the palace, complaining to the King that a mighty young Prince in shining armour, with a parrot on his wrist and a gallant steed beside him, sat by the well, and broke their pitchers', " Now, as soon as Rajah Salabhan heard this, he guessed at once that it was Prince Rasalu come forth before the time, and, mindful of the Jogis' words that he would die if he looked on his son's face before twelve years were past, he did not dare to send his guards to seize the offender and bring him to be judged", ' So he bade the women be comforted, and take pitchers of iron and brass, giving new ones from his treasury to those who did not possess any of their own  But when Prince Rasalu saw the women returning to the well with pitchers of iron and brass, he laughed to himself, and drew his mighty bow till the sharp-pointed arrows pierced the metal vessels as though they had been clay  Yet still the King did not send for him, so he mounted his steed and set off in the pride of his youth and strength to the palace  He strode into the audience hall, where his father sat trembling, and saluted him with all reverence; but Raja Salabhan, in fear of his life, turned his back hastily and said never a word in reply  Then Prince Rasalu called scornfully to him across the hall:   "I came to greet thee, King, and not to harm thee!    What have I done that thou shouldst turn away?   Sceptre and empire have no power to charm me--    I go to seek a worthier prize than they!" Then he strode away, full of bitterness and anger; but, as he passed under the palace windows, he heard his mother weeping, and the sound softened his heart, so that his wrath died down, and a great loneliness fell upon him, because he was spurned by both father and mother  So he cried sorrowfully,   "Oh heart crown\'d with grief, hast thou nought    But tears for thy son?   Art mother of mine? Give one thought    To my life just begun!" And Queen Lona answered through her tears:   "Yea! mother am I, though I weep,    So hold this word sure,--   Go, reign king of all men, but keep    Thy heart good and pure!" So Raja Rasalu was comforted, and began to make ready for fortune  He took with him his horse Bhaunr and his parrot, both of whom had lived with him since he was born  So they made a goodly company, and Queen Lona, when she saw them going, watched them from her window till she saw nothing but a cloud of dust on the horizon; then she bowed her head on her hands and wept, saying:   "Oh! son who ne\'er gladdened mine eyes,   Let the cloud of thy going arise,   Dim the sunlight and darken the day;   For the mother whose son is away       Is as dust!" Rasalu had started off to play chaupur with King Sarkap  And as he journeyed there came a fierce storm of thunder and lightning, so that he sought shelter, and found none save an old graveyard, where a headless corpse lay upon the ground  So lonesome was it that even the corpse seemed company, and Rasalu, sitting down beside it, said:   "There is no one here, nor far nor near,    Save this breathless corpse so cold and grim;   Would God he might come to life again,    \'Twould be less lonely to talk to him " And immediately the headless corpse arose and sat beside Raja Rasalu  And he, nothing astonished, said to it:   "The storm beats fierce and loud,    The clouds rise thick in the west;   What ails thy grave and shroud,    Oh corpse! that thou canst not rest?" Then the headless corpse replied:   "On earth I was even as thou,    My turban awry like a king,   My head with the highest, I trow,    Having my fun and my fling,   Fighting my foes like a brave,    Living my life with a swing        And, now I am dead,       Sins, heavy as lead,   Will give me no rest in my grave!" So the night passed on, dark and dreary, while Rasalu sat in the graveyard and talked to the headless corpse  Now when morning broke and Rasalu said he must continue his journey, the headless corpse asked him whither he was going, and when he said "to play chaupur with King Sarkap," the corpse begged him to give up the idea saying, "I am King Sarkap\'s brother, and I know his ways There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child  At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire  These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs  It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world  One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion - rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some  This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable  Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, what ails you, dear wife', " Ah, she replied, if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die", ' The man, who loved her, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will  At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife  She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily  It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before  If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden  In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again  But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him  How can you dare, said she with angry look, descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief  You shall suffer for it  Ah, answered he, let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity  My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat  Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world  It shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother  The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of rapunzel, and took it away with her  Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun  When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window  When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,   rapunzel, rapunzel,   let down your hair to me  Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it', " After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode through the forest and passed by the tower", ' Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened  This was rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound', " The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found" ,  ' ONCE upon a time there lived a man and his wife who were very unhappy because they had no children  These good people had a little window at the back of their house, which looked into the most lovely garden, full of all manner of beautiful flowers and vegetables; but the garden was surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to enter it, for it belonged to a witch of great power, who was feared by the whole world  One day the woman stood at the window overlooking the garden, and saw there a bed full of the finest rampion: the leaves looked so fresh and green that she longed to eat them', " The desire grew day by day, and just because she knew she couldn't possibly get any, she pined away and became quite pale and wretched", " Then her husband grew alarmed and said: 'What ails you, dear wife?' 'Oh,' she answered, 'if I don't get some rampion to eat out of the garden behind the house, I know I shall die", "' The man, who loved her dearly, thought to himself, 'Come! rather than let your wife die you shall fetch her some rampion, no matter the cost", "' So at dusk he climbed over the wall into the witch's garden, and, hastily gathering a handful of rampion leaves, he returned with them to his wife", ' She made them into a salad, which tasted so good that her longing for the forbidden food was greater than ever  If she were to know any peace of mind, there was nothing for it but that her husband should climb over the garden wall again, and fetch her some more  So at dusk over he got, but when he reached the other side he drew back in terror, for there, standing before him, was the old witch', " 'How dare you,' she said, with a wrathful glance, 'climb into my garden and steal my rampion like a common thief? You shall suffer for your foolhardiness", "' 'Oh!' he implored, 'pardon my presumption; necessity alone drove me to the deed", ' My wife saw your rampion from her window, and conceived such a desire for it that she would certainly have died if her wish had not been gratified', "' Then the Witch's anger was a little appeased, and she said: 'If it's as you say, you may take as much rampion away with you as you like, but on one condition only--that you give me the child your wife will shortly bring into the world", ' All shall go well with it, and I will look after it like a mother', "' The man in his terror agreed to everything she asked, and as soon as the child was born the Witch appeared, and having given it the name of Rapunzel, which is the same as rampion, she carried it off with her", ' Rapunzel was the most beautiful child under the sun  When she was twelve years old the Witch shut her up in a tower, in the middle of a great wood, and the tower had neither stairs nor doors, only high up at the very top a small window', " When the old Witch wanted to get in she stood underneath and called out:    'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,   Let down your golden hair,' for Rapunzel had wonderful long hair, and it was as fine as spun gold", " Whenever she heard the Witch's voice she unloosed her plaits, and let her hair fall down out of the window about twenty yards below, and the old Witch climbed up by it", ' After they had lived like this for a few years, it happened one day that a Prince was riding through the wood and passed by the tower  As he drew near it he heard someone singing so sweetly that he stood still spell-bound, and listened  It was Rapunzel in her loneliness trying to while away the time by letting her sweet voice ring out into the wood  The Prince longed to see the owner of the voice, but he sought in vain for a door in the tower  He rode home, but he was so haunted by the song he had heard that he returned every day to the wood and listened', " One day, when he was standing thus behind a tree, he saw the old Witch approach and heard her call out:    'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,   Let down your golden hair", "' Then Rapunzel let down her plaits, and the Witch climbed up by them", " 'So that's the staircase, is it?' said the Prince", " 'Then I too will climb it and try my luck", "' So on the following day, at dusk, he went to the foot of the tower and cried:   'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,   Let down your golden hair,' and as soon as she had let it down the Prince climbed up" ,  ' There was, once upon a time, a Queen, who was brought to bed of a son, so hideously ugly, that it was long disputed, whether he had human form  A Fairy, who was at his birth, affirmed, he would be very lovable for all that, since he should be indowed with abundance of wit  She even added, that it would be in his power, by virtue of a gift she had just then given him, to bestow on the person he most loved as much wit as he pleased  All this somewhat comforted the poor Queen, who was under a grievous affliction for having brought into the world such an ugly brat  It is true, that this child no sooner began to prattle, but he said a thousand pretty things, and that in all his actions there was something so taking, that he charmed every-body  I forgot to tell you, that he came into the world with a little tuft of hair upon his head, which made them call him Riquet with the Tuft, for Riquet was the family name  Seven or eight years after this, the Queen of a neighbouring kingdom was delivered of two daughters at a birth  The first-born of these was beautiful beyond compare, whereat the Queen was so very glad, that those present were afraid that her excess of joy would do her harm', " The same Fairy, who had assisted at the birth of little Riquet with the Tuft, was here also; and, to moderate the Queen's gladness, she declared, that this little Princess should have no wit at all, but be as stupid as she was pretty", ' This mortified the Queen extreamly, but some moments afterwards she had far greater sorrow; for, the second daughter she was delivered of, was very ugly  "Do not afflict yourself so much, Madam," said the Fairy; "your daughter shall have so great a portion of wit, that her want of beauty will scarcely be perceived " "God grant it," replied the Queen; "but is there no way to make the eldest, who is so pretty, have some little wit?" "I can do nothing for her, Madam, as to wit," answered the Fairy, "but everything as to beauty; and as there is nothing but what I would do for your satisfaction, I give her for gift, that she shall have the power to make handsome the person who shall best please her " As these Princesses grew up, their perfections grew up with them; all the public talk was of the beauty of the eldest, and the wit of the youngest  It is true also that their defects increased considerably with their age; the youngest visibly grew uglier and uglier, and the eldest became every day more and more stupid; she either made no answer at all to what was asked her, or said something very silly; she was with all this so unhandy, that she could not place four pieces of china upon the mantlepiece, without breaking one of them, nor drink a glass of water without spilling half of it upon her cloaths', " Tho' beauty is a very great advantage in young people, yet here the youngest sister bore away the bell, almost always, in all companies from the eldest; people would indeed, go first to the Beauty to look upon, and admire her, but turn aside soon after to the Wit, to hear a thousand most entertaining and agreeable turns, and it was amazing to see, in less than a quarter of an hour's time, the eldest with not a soul with her and the whole company crowding about the youngest", " The eldest, tho' she was unaccountably dull, could not but notice it, and would have given all her beauty to have half the wit of her sister", ' The Queen, prudent as she was, could not help reproaching her several times, which had like to have made this poor Princess die for grief  One day, as she retired into the wood to bewail her misfortune, she saw, coming to her, a little man, very disagreeable, but most magnificently dressed', " This was the young Prince Riquet with the Tuft, who having fallen in love with her, by seeing her picture, many of which went all the world over, had left his father's kingdom, to have the pleasure of seeing and talking with her", ' Overjoyed to find her thus all alone, he addressed himself to her with all imaginable politeness and respect  Having observed, after he had made her the ordinary compliments, that she was extremely melancholy, he said to her: "I cannot comprehend, Madam, how a person so beautiful as you are, can be so sorrowful as you seem to be; for tho\' I can boast of having seen infinite numbers of ladies exquisitely charming, I can say that I never beheld any one whose beauty approaches yours " "You are pleased to say so," answered the Princess, and here she stopped  "Beauty," replied Riquet with the Tuft, "is such a great advantage, that it ought to take the place of all things; and since you possess this treasure, I see nothing that can possibly very much afflict you " "I had far rather," cried the Princess, "be as ugly as you are, and have wit, than have the beauty I possess, and be so stupid as I am " "There is nothing, Madam," returned he, "shews more that we have wit, than to believe we have none; and it is the nature of that excellent quality, that the more people have of it, the more they believe they want it " "I do not know that," said the Princess; "but I know, very well, that I am very senseless, and thence proceeds the vexation which almost kills me " "If that be all, Madam, which troubles you, I can very easily put an end to your affliction " "And how will you do that?" cried the Princess  "I have the power, Madam," replied Riquet with the Tuft, "to give to that person whom I shall love best, as much wit as can be had; and as you, Madam, are that very person, it will be your fault only, if you have not as great a share of it as any one living, provided you will be pleased to marry me " The Princess remained quite astonished, and answered not a word  Over all the vast under-world the mountain Gnome Rubezahl was lord; and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him  There were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through, and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks  Some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal, or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies; for Rubezahl loved all pretty things  Sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions, and come out upon the green earth for a while, and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing  And as gnomes live many hundreds of years he saw strange things  For, the first time he came up, the great hills were covered with thick forests, in which wild animals roamed, and Rubezahl watched the fierce fights between bear and bison, or chased the grey wolves, or amused himself by rolling great rocks down into the desolate valleys, to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills', " But the next time he ventured above ground, what was his surprise to find everything changed! The dark woods were hewn down, and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounding cosy-looking thatched cottages; for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air, sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows, while from the shade of the hedges came the music of the shepherd's pipe", " The strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests, who, without saying 'by your leave' or 'with your leave,' had made themselves so very much at home upon is hills; nor did he wish to interfere with their doings, but left them in quiet possession of their homes, as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves", " He was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called 'man,' so, taking the form of an old field labourer, he entered the service of a farmer", ' Under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly, but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful, and Rubezahl soon left him, and went to be shepherd to his next neighbour  He tended the flock so diligently, and knew so well where to lead the sheep to the sweetest pastures, and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away, that they too prospered under his care, and not one was lost or torn by wolves; but this new master was a hard man, and begrudged him his well-earned wages  So he ran away and went to serve the judge  Here he upheld the law with might and main, and was a terror to thieves and evildoers; but the judge was a bad man, who took bribes, and despised the law  Rubezahl would not be the tool of an unjust man, and so he told his master, who thereupon ordered him to be thrown in prison  Of course that did not trouble the gnome at all, he simply got out through the keyhole, and went away down to his underground palace, very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind  But, as time went on, he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him, and thought he would take another look at the upper world  So he stole into the valley, keeping himself carefully hidden in copse or hedgerow, and very soon met with an adventure; for, peeping through a screen of leaves, he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden, fresh as the spring, and beautiful to look upon  Around her upon the grass lay her young companions, as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game  Beyond them flowed a little brook, into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock, filling the air with its pleasant sound, and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide  The sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that, for the first time, he wished himself a mortal; and, longing for a better view of the gay company, he changed himself into a raven and perched upon an oaktree which overhung the brook  But he soon found that this was not at all a good plan', " He could only see with a raven's eyes, and feel as a raven feels; and a nest of field-mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens", ' When he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket, and took the form of a handsome young man--that was the best way--and he fell in love with the girl then and there  The fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country, and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits, till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn by the brook to rest, or to bathe in the cool waters  On this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood', " This was Master Rubezahl's opportunity", ' Stepping out of his hiding-place he stood in the midst of the little lawn, weaving his magic spells, till slowly all about him changed, and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting-place they stood lost in amazement, and almost fancied that they must be dreaming  The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster; the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed, flowed in silence now in its smooth channel, from which a clear fountain leapt, to fall again in showers of diamond drops, now on this side now on that, as the wandering breeze scattered it  Daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink, while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round, making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable  To the right and left of the waterfall opened out a wonderful grotto, its walls and arches glittering with many-coloured rock-crystals, while in every niche were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats, the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them \tRumpelstiltskin Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter  Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king, and in order to make himself appear important he said to him, I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold  The king said to the miller, that is an art which pleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my palace, and I will put her to the test  And when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room which was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said, now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning early you have not spun this straw into gold during the night, you must die  Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone', " So there sat the poor miller's daughter, and for the life of her could not tell what to do, she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and more frightened, until at last she began to weep", ' But all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, and said, good evening, mistress miller, why are you crying so  Alas, answered the girl, I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not know how to do it  What will you give me, said the manikin, if I do it for you  My necklace, said the girl  The little man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was full, then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the second was full too  And so it went on until the morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold  By daybreak the king was already there, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart became only more greedy', " He had the miller's daughter taken into another room full of straw, which was much larger, and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she valued her life", ' The girl knew not how to help herself, and was crying, when the door opened again, and the little man appeared, and said, what will you give me if I spin that straw into gold for you  The ring on my finger, answered the girl  The little man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold', " The king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not gold enough, and he had the miller's daughter taken into a still larger room full of straw, and said, you must spin this, too, in the course of this night, but if you succeed, you shall be my wife", " Even if she be a miller's daughter, thought he, I could not find a richer wife in the whole world", ' When the girl was alone the manikin came again for the third time, and said, what will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time also  I have nothing left that I could give, answered the girl  Then promise me, if you should become queen, to give me your first child', " Who knows whether that will ever happen, thought the miller's daughter, and, not knowing how else to help herself in this strait, she promised the manikin what he wanted, and for that he once more spun the straw into gold", " And when the king came in the morning, and found all as he had wished, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller's daughter became a queen", ' A year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world, and she never gave a thought to the manikin  But suddenly he came into her room, and said, now give me what you promised  The queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child  But the manikin said, no, something alive is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world  Then the queen began to lament and cry, so that the manikin pitied her  I will give you three days, time, said he, if by that time you find out my name, then shall you keep your child  There was once a poor Miller who had a beautiful daughter, and one day, having to go to speak with the King, he said, in order to make himself appear of consequence, that he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold  The King was very fond of gold, and thought to himself, "That is an art which would please me very well"; and so he said to the Miller, "If your daughter is so very clever, bring her to the castle in the morning, and I will put her to the proof " As soon as she arrived the King led her into a chamber which was full of straw; and, giving her a wheel and a reel, he said, "Now set yourself to work, and if you have not spun this straw into gold by an early hour to-morrow, you must die " With these words he shut the room door, and left the maiden alone  There she sat for a long time, thinking how to save her life; for she understood nothing of the art whereby straw might be spun into gold; and her perplexity increased more and more, till at last she began to weep  All at once the door opened, and in stepped a little Man, who said, "Good evening, fair maiden; why do you weep so sore?" "Ah," she replied, "I must spin this straw into gold, and I am sure I do not know how " The little Man asked, "What will you give me if I spin it for you?" "My necklace," said the maiden  The Dwarf took it, placed himself in front of the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the bobbin was full  Then he set up another, and whir, whir, whir, thrice round again, and a second bobbin was full; and so he went all night long, until all the straw was spun, and the bobbins were full of gold  At sunrise the King came, very much astonished to see the gold; the sight of which gladdened him, but did not make his heart less covetous  He caused the maiden to be led into another room, still larger, full of straw; and then he bade her spin it into gold during the night if she valued her life  The maiden was again quite at a loss what to do; but while she cried the door opened suddenly, as before, and the Dwarf appeared and asked her what she would give him in return for his assistance  "The ring off my finger," she replied  The little Man took the ring and began to spin at once, and by morning all the straw was changed to glistening gold  The King was rejoiced above measure at the sight of this, but still he was not satisfied, but, leading the maiden into another still larger room, full of straw as the others, he said, "This you must spin during the night; but if you accomplish it you shall be my bride " "For," thought he to himself, "a richer wife thou canst not have in all the world " When the maiden was left alone, the Dwarf again appeared and asked, for the third time, "What will you give me to do this for you?" "I have nothing left that I can give you," replied the maiden  "Then promise me your first-born child if you become Queen," said he  The Miller\'s daughter thought, "Who can tell if that will ever happen?" and, ignorant how else to help herself out of her trouble, she promised the Dwarf what he desired; and he immediately set about and finished the spinning', " When morning came, and the King found all he had wished for done, he celebrated his wedding, and the Miller's fair daughter became Queen", " The gay times she had at the King's Court caused her to forget that she had made a very foolish promise", ' About a year after the marriage, when she had ceased to think about the little Dwarf, she brought a fine child into the world; and, suddenly, soon after its birth, the very man appeared and demanded what she had promised  The frightened Queen offered him all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her her child; but the Dwarf answered, "No; something human is dearer to me than all the wealth of the world " The Queen began to weep and groan so much that the Dwarf pitied her, and said, "I will leave you three days to consider; if you in that time discover my name you shall keep your child " All night long the Queen racked her brains for all the names she could think of, and sent a messenger through the country to collect far and wide any new names  The following morning came the Dwarf, and she began with "Caspar," "Melchior," "Balthassar," and all the odd names she knew; but at each the little Man exclaimed, "That is not my name " The second day the Queen inquired of all her people for uncommon and curious names, and called the Dwarf "Ribs-of-Beef," "Sheep-shank," "Whalebone," but at each he said, "This is not my name " The third day the messenger came back and said, "I have not found a single name; but as I came to a high mountain near the edge of a forest, where foxes and hares say good night to each other, I saw there a little house, and before the door a fire was burning, and round this fire a very curious little Man was dancing on one leg, and shouting:  "\'To-day I stew, and then I\'ll bake,  To-morrow I shall the Queen\'s child take;  Ah! how famous it is that nobody knows  That my name is Rumpelstiltskin \'" When the Queen heard this she was very glad, for now she knew the name; and soon after came the Dwarf, and asked, "Now, my lady Queen, what is my name?" First she said, "Are you called Conrade?" "No " "Are you called Hal?" "No  In Novgorod in the old days there was a young man--just a boy he was--the son of a rich merchant who had lost all his money and died  So Sadko was very poor  He had not a kopeck in the world, except what the people gave him when he played his dulcimer for their dancing  He had blue eyes and curling hair, and he was strong, and would have been merry; but it is dull work playing for other folk to dance, and Sadko dared not dance with any young girl, for he had no money to marry on, and he did not want to be chased away as a beggar  And the young women of Novgorod, they never looked at the handsome Sadko  No; they smiled with their bright eyes at the young men who danced with them, and if they ever spoke to Sadko, it was just to tell him sharply to keep the music going or to play faster  So Sadko lived alone with his dulcimer, and made do with half a loaf when he could not get a whole, and with crust when he had no crumb  He did not mind so very much what came to him, so long as he could play his dulcimer and walk along the banks of the little river Volkhov that flows by Novgorod, or on the shores of the lake, making music for himself, and seeing the pale mists rise over the water, and dawn or sunset across the shining river  "There is no girl in all Novgorod as pretty as my little river," he used to say, and night after night he would sit by the banks of the river or on the shores of the lake, playing the dulcimer and singing to himself  Sometimes he helped the fishermen on the lake, and they would give him a little fish for his supper in payment for his strong young arms  And it happened that one evening the fishermen asked him to watch their nets for them on the shore, while they went off to take their fish to sell them in the square at Novgorod  Sadko sat on the shore, on a rock, and played his dulcimer and sang  Very sweetly he sang of the fair lake and the lovely river--the little river that he thought prettier than all the girls of Novgorod  And while he was singing he saw a whirlpool in the lake, little waves flying from it across the water, and in the middle a hollow down into the water  And in the hollow he saw the head of a great man with blue hair and a gold crown  He knew that the huge man was the Tzar of the Sea  And the man came nearer, walking up out of the depths of the lake--a huge, great man, a very giant, with blue hair falling to his waist over his broad shoulders  The little waves ran from him in all directions as he came striding up out of the water  Sadko did not know whether to run or stay; but the Tzar of the Sea called out to him in a great voice like wind and water in a storm,-- "Sadko of Novgorod, you have played and sung many days by the side of this lake and on the banks of the little river Volkhov  My daughters love your music, and it has pleased me too  Throw out a net into the water, and draw it in, and the waters will pay you for your singing  And if you are satisfied with the payment, you must come and play to us down in the green palace of the sea " With that the Tzar of the Sea went down again into the waters of the lake  The waves closed over him with a roar, and presently the lake was as smooth and calm as it had ever been  Sadko thought, and said to himself: "Well, there is no harm done in casting out a net " So he threw a net out into the lake  He sat down again and played on his dulcimer and sang, and when he had finished his singing the dusk had fallen and the moon shone over the lake  He put down his dulcimer and took hold of the ropes of the net, and began to draw it up out of the silver water  Easily the ropes came, and the net, dripping and glittering in the moonlight  "I was dreaming," said Sadko; "I was asleep when I saw the Tzar of the Sea, and there is nothing in the net at all  It was the custom in old times that as soon as a Japanese boy reached manhood he should leave his home and roam through the land in search of adventures  Sometimes he would meet with a young man bent on the same business as himself, and then they would fight in a friendly manner, merely to prove which was the stronger, but on other occasions the enemy would turn out to be a robber, who had become the terror of the neighbourhood, and then the battle was in deadly earnest  One day a youth started off from his native village, resolved never to come back till he had done some great deed that would make his name famous  But adventures did not seem very plentiful just then, and he wandered about for a long time without meeting either with fierce giants or distressed damsels  At last he saw in the distance a wild mountain, half covered with a dense forest, and thinking that this promised well at once took the road that led to it  The difficulties he met with--huge rocks to be climbed, deep rivers to be crossed, and thorny tracts to be avoided--only served to make his heart beat quicker, for he was really brave all through, and not merely when he could not help himself, like a great many people  But in spite of all his efforts he could not find his way out of the forest, and he began to think he should have to pass the night there  Once more he strained his eyes to see if there was no place in which he could take shelter, and this time he caught sight of a small chapel in a little clearing  He hastened quickly towards it, and curling himself up in a warm corner soon fell asleep  Not a sound was heard through the whole forest for some hours, but at midnight there suddenly arose such a clamour that the young man, tired as he was, started broad awake in an instant  Peeping cautiously between the wooden pillars of the chapel, he saw a troop of hideous cats, dancing furiously, making the night horrible with their yells  The full moon lighted up the weird scene, and the young warrior gazed with astonishment, taking great care to keep still, lest he should be discovered', " After some time he thought that in the midst of all their shrieks he could make out the words, 'Do not tell Schippeitaro! Keep it hidden and secret! Do not tell Schippeitaro!' Then, the midnight hour having passed, they all vanished, and the youth was left alone", ' Exhausted by all that had been going on round him, he flung himself on the ground and slept till the sun rose  The moment he woke he felt very hungry, and began to think how he could get something to eat', " So he got up and walked on, and before he had gone very far was lucky enough to find a little side-path, where he could trace men's footsteps", ' He followed the track, and by-and-by came on some scattered huts, beyond which lay a village', " Delighted at this discovery, he was about to hasten to the village when he heard a woman's voice weeping and lamenting, and calling on the men to take pity on her and help her", ' The sound of her distress made him forget he was hungry, and he strode into the hut to find out for himself what was wrong  But the men whom he asked only shook their heads and told him it was not a matter in which he could give any help, for all this sorrow was caused by the Spirit of the Mountain, to whom every year they were bound to furnish a maiden for him to eat', " 'To-morrow night,' said they, 'the horrible creature will come for his dinner, and the cries you have heard were uttered by the girl before you, upon whom the lot has fallen", "' And when the young man asked if the girl was carried off straight from her home, they answered no, but that a large cask was set in the forest chapel, and into this she was fastened", ' As he listened to this story, the young man was filled with a great longing to rescue the maiden from her dreadful fate  The mention of the chapel set him thinking of the scene of the previous night, and he went over all the details again in his mind', " 'Who is Schippeitaro?' he suddenly asked; 'can any of you tell me?' 'Schippeitaro is the great dog that belongs to the overseer of our prince,' said they; 'and he lives not far away", "' And they began to laugh at the question, which seemed to them so odd and useless", ' The young man did not laugh with them, but instead left the hut and went straight to the owner of the dog, whom he begged to lend him the animal just for one night', " Schippeitaro's master was not at all willing to give him in charge to a man of whom he knew nothing, but in the end he consented, and the youth led the dog away, promising faithfully to return him next day to his master", ' He next hurried to the hut where the maiden lived, and entreated her parents to shut her up safely in a closet, after which he took Schippeitaro to the cask, and fastened him into it  In the evening he knew that the cask would be placed in the chapel, so he hid himself there and waited  I had resolved, as you know, on my return from my first voyage, to spend the rest of my days quietly in Bagdad, but very soon I grew tired of such an idle life and longed once more to find myself upon the sea  I procured, therefore, such goods as were suitable for the places I intended to visit, and embarked for the second time in a good ship with other merchants whom I knew to be honourable men  We went from island to island, often making excellent bargains, until one day we landed at a spot which, though covered with fruit trees and abounding in springs of excellent water, appeared to possess neither houses nor people  While my companions wandered here and there gathering flowers and fruit I sat down in a shady place, and, having heartily enjoyed the provisions and the wine I had brought with me, I fell asleep, lulled by the murmur of a clear brook which flowed close by  How long I slept I know not, but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone  I rushed to and fro like one distracted, uttering cries of despair, and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon, I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety  But since wishes could do me no good, I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape  When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea; but, finding nothing hopeful there, I turned landward, and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object, so far off that I could not make out what it might be  Descending from the tree I hastily collected what remained of my provisions and set off as fast as I could go towards it  As I drew near it seemed to me to be a white ball of immense size and height, and when I could touch it, I found it marvellously smooth and soft  As it was impossible to climb it--for it presented no foot-hold--I walked round about it seeking some opening, but there was none  I counted, however, that it was at least fifty paces round  By this time the sun was near setting, but quite suddenly it fell dark, something like a huge black cloud came swiftly over me, and I saw with amazement that it was a bird of extraordinary size which was hovering near  Then I remembered that I had often heard the sailors speak of a wonderful bird called a roc, and it occurred to me that the white object which had so puzzled me must be its egg', " Sure enough the bird settled slowly down upon it, covering it with its wings to keep it warm, and I cowered close beside the egg in such a position that one of the bird's feet, which was as large as the trunk of a tree, was just in front of me", ' Taking off my turban I bound myself securely to it with the linen in the hope that the roc, when it took flight next morning, would bear me away with it from the desolate island  And this was precisely what did happen  As soon as the dawn appeared the bird rose into the air carrying me up and up till I could no longer see the earth, and then suddenly it descended so swiftly that I almost lost consciousness  When I became aware that the roc had settled and that I was once again upon solid ground, I hastily unbound my turban from its foot and freed myself, and that not a moment too soon; for the bird, pouncing upon a huge snake, killed it with a few blows from its powerful beak, and seizing it up rose into the air once more and soon disappeared from my view  When I had looked about me I began to doubt if I had gained anything by quitting the desolate island  The valley in which I found myself was deep and narrow, and surrounded by mountains which towered into the clouds, and were so steep and rocky that there was no way of climbing up their sides  As I wandered about, seeking anxiously for some means of escaping from this trap, I observed that the ground was strewed with diamonds, some of them of an astonishing size  This sight gave me great pleasure, but my delight was speedily damped when I saw also numbers of horrible snakes so long and so large that the smallest of them could have swallowed an elephant with ease  Fortunately for me they seemed to hide in caverns of the rocks by day, and only came out by night, probably because of their enemy the roc  All day long I wandered up and down the valley, and when it grew dusk I crept into a little cave, and having blocked up the entrance to it with a stone, I ate part of my little store of food and lay down to sleep, but all through the night the serpents crawled to and fro, hissing horribly, so that I could scarcely close my eyes for terror  I was thankful when the morning light appeared, and when I judged by the silence that the serpents had retreated to their dens I came tremblingly out of my cave and wandered up and down the valley once more, kicking the diamonds contemptuously out of my path, for I felt that they were indeed vain things to a man in my situation  At last, overcome with weariness, I sat down upon a rock, but I had hardly closed my eyes when I was startled by something which fell to the ground with a thud close beside me  It was a huge piece of fresh meat, and as I stared at it several more pieces rolled over the cliffs in different places', " I had always thought that the stories the sailors told of the famous valley of diamonds, and of the cunning way which some merchants had devised for getting at the precious stones, were mere travellers' tales invented to give pleasure to the hearers, but now I perceived that they were surely true", ' These merchants came to the valley at the time when the eagles, which keep their eyries in the rocks, had hatched their young  After my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would go to sea no more  I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life, and I had run risks enough  I only wished to end my days in peace  One day, however, when I was entertaining a number of my friends, I was told that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me, and when he was admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of Haroun al Raschid, which I accordingly did  After I had saluted him, the Caliph said: "I have sent for you, Sindbad, because I need your services  I have chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib in return for his message of friendship " The Caliph\'s commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt  "Commander of the Faithful," I answered, "I am ready to do all that your Majesty commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that I am utterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings I have undergone  Indeed, I have made a vow never again to leave Bagdad " With this I gave him a long account of some of my strangest adventures, to which he listened patiently  "I admit," said he, "that you have indeed had some extraordinary experiences, but I do not see why they should hinder you from doing as I wish  You have only to go straight to Serendib and give my message, then you are free to come back and do as you will  But go you must; my honour and dignity demand it " Seeing that there was no help for it, I declared myself willing to obey; and the Caliph, delighted at having got his own way, gave me a thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage  I was soon ready to start, and taking the letter and the present I embarked at Balsora, and sailed quickly and safely to Serendib  Here, when I had disclosed my errand, I was well received, and brought into the presence of the king, who greeted me with joy  "Welcome, Sindbad," he cried  "I have thought of you often, and rejoice to see you once more " After thanking him for the honour that he did me, I displayed the Caliph\'s gifts  First a bed with complete hangings all cloth of gold, which cost a thousand sequins, and another like to it of crimson stuff  Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the finest white linen from Cairo, Suez, Cufa, and Alexandria  Then more beds of different fashion, and an agate vase carved with the figure of a man aiming an arrow at a lion, and finally a costly table, which had once belonged to King Solomon', " The King of Serendib received with satisfaction the assurance of the Caliph's friendliness toward him, and now my task being accomplished I was anxious to depart, but it was some time before the king would think of letting me go", ' At last, however, he dismissed me with many presents, and I lost no time in going on board a ship, which sailed at once, and for four days all went well  On the fifth day we had the misfortune to fall in with pirates, who seized our vessel, killing all who resisted, and making prisoners of those who were prudent enough to submit at once, of whom I was one  When they had despoiled us of all we possessed, they forced us to put on vile raiment, and sailing to a distant island there sold us for slaves  I fell into the hands of a rich merchant, who took me home with him, and clothed and fed me well, and after some days sent for me and questioned me as to what I could do  I answered that I was a rich merchant who had been captured by pirates, and therefore I knew no trade  "Tell me," said he, "can you shoot with a bow?" I replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth, and that doubtless with practice my skill would come back to me  Upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows, and mounting me with him upon his own elephant took the way to a vast forest which lay far from the town There was once a tailor, who was a quarrelsome fellow, and his wife, who was good, industrious, and pious, never could please him  Whatever she did, he was not satisfied, but grumbled and scolded, and knocked her about and beat her  As the authorities at last heard of it, they had him summoned and put in prison in order to make him better  He was kept for a while on bread and water, and then set free again  He was forced, however, to promise not to beat his wife any more, but to live with her in peace, and share joy and sorrow with her, as married people ought to do  All went on well for a time, but then he fell into his old ways and was surly and quarrelsome  And because he dared not beat her, he would seize her by the hair and tear it out  The woman escaped from him, and sprang out into the yard, but he ran after her with his yard-measure and scissors, and chased her about, and threw the yard-measure and scissors at her, and whatever else came his way  When he hit her he laughed, and when he missed her, he stormed and swore', " This went on so long that the neighbors came to the wife's assistance", ' The tailor was again summoned before the magistrates, and reminded of his promise  Dear gentlemen, said he, I have kept my word, I have not beaten her, but have shared joy and sorrow with her  How can that be, said the judge, as she continues to bring such heavy complaints against you  I have not beaten her, but just because she looked so strange I wanted to comb her hair with my hand  She, however, got away from me, and left me quite spitefully  Then I hurried after her, and in order to bring her back to her duty, I threw at her as a well-meant reminder whatever came readily to hand  I have shared joy and sorrow with her also, for whenever I hit her I was full of joy and she of sorrow, and if I missed her, then she was joyful, and I sorry  The judges were not satisfied with this answer, but gave him the reward he deserved    Once upon a time a shepherd was taking his flock out to pasture, when he found a little baby lying in a meadow, left there by some wicked person, who thought it was too much trouble to look after it  The shepherd was fond of children, so he took the baby home with him and gave it plenty of milk, and by the time the boy was fourteen he could tear up oaks as if they were weeds  Then Paul, as the shepherd had called him, grew tired of living at home, and went out into the world to try his luck  He walked on for many miles, seeing nothing that surprised him, but in an open space of the wood he was astonished at finding a man combing trees as another man would comb flax', " 'Good morning, friend,' said Paul; 'upon my word, you must be a strong man!' The man stopped his work and laughed", " 'I am Tree Comber,' he answered proudly; 'and the greatest wish of my life is to wrestle with Shepherd Paul", "' 'May all your wishes be fulfilled as easily, for I am Shepherd Paul, and can wrestle with you at once,' replied the lad; and he seized Tree Comber and flung him with such force to the ground that he sank up to his knees in the earth", " However, in a moment he was up again, and catching hold of Paul, threw him so that he sank up to his waist; but then it was Paul's turn again, and this time the man was buried up to his neck", " 'That is enough,' cried he; 'I see you are a smart fellow, let us become friends", "' 'Very good,' answered Paul, and they continued their journey together", ' By-and-by they reached a man who was grinding stones to powder in his hands, as if they had been nuts', " 'Good morning,' said Paul politely; 'upon my word, you must be a strong fellow!' 'I am Stone Crusher,' answered the man, and the greatest wish of my life is to wrestle with Shepherd Paul", "' 'May all your wishes be as easily fulfilled, for I am Shepherd Paul, and will wrestle with you at once,' and the sport began", ' After a short time the man declared himself beaten, and begged leave to go with them; so they all three travelled together  A little further on they came upon a man who was kneading iron as if it had been dough', " 'Good morning,' said Paul, 'you must be a strong fellow", "' 'I am Iron Kneader, and should like to fight Shepherd Paul,' answered he", " 'Let us begin at once then,' replied Paul; and on this occasion also, Paul got the better of his foe, and they all four continued their journey", ' At midday they entered a forest, and Paul stopped suddenly', " 'We three will go and look for game,' he said, 'and you, Tree Comber, will stay behind and prepare a good supper for us", "' So Tree Comber set to work to boil and roast, and when dinner was nearly ready, a little dwarf with a pointed beard strolled up to the place", " 'What are you cooking?' asked he, 'give me some of it", "' 'I'll give you some on your back, if you like,' answered Tree Comber rudely", ' The dwarf took no notice, but waited patiently till the dinner was cooked, then suddenly throwing Tree Comber on the ground, he ate up the contents of the saucepan and vanished  Tree Comber felt rather ashamed of himself, and set about boiling some more vegetables, but they were still very hard when the hunters returned, and though they complained of his bad cooking, he did not tell them about the dwarf  Next day Stone Crusher was left behind, and after him Iron Kneader, and each time the dwarf appeared, and they fared no better than Tree Comber had done', " The fourth day Paul said to them: 'My friends, there must be some reason why your cooking has always been so bad, now you shall go and hunt and I will stay behind", "' So they went off, amusing themselves by thinking what was in store for Paul", ' He set to work at once, and had just got all his vegetables simmering in the pot when the dwarf appeared as before, and asked to have some of the stew', " 'Be off,' cried Paul, snatching up the saucepan as he spoke" ,  'There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor  The rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he gained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so badly that he had no bread for his wife and children  Once when he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on one side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he had never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with amazement  While he was thus standing he saw twelve great, wild men coming towards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his barrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen  The twelve men, however, went to the mountain and cried, semsi mountain, semsi mountain, open up, and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and the twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it shut  After a short time, it opened again, and the men came forth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they were all once more in the daylight they said, semsi mountain, semsi mountain, shut yourself, then the mountain closed together, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it, and the twelve went away  When they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree, and was curious to know what was secretly hidden in the mountain  So he went up to it and said, semsi mountain, semsi mountain, open up, and the mountain opened up to him also  Then he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn  The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not  At last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were  When he came out again he also said, semsi mountain, semsi mountain, shut yourself, and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow  And now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain  He lived joyously and honorably, gave help to the poor, and did good to every one  When the money came to an end, however, he went to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel, and brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the most valuable things  When for the third time he wanted to fetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother', " But the rich man had long been envious of his brother's possessions, and of the handsome household which he kept up, and could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his brother wanted with the measure", ' Then he thought of a cunning trick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when he got the measure back a piece of gold was sticking to it  He at once went to his brother and asked him, what have you been measuring in the bushel measure  Corn and barley, said the other  Then he showed him the piece of gold and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would accuse him before a court of justice  The poor man then told him everything, just as it had happened  So the rich man ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away, resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures  When he came to the mountain he cried, semsi mountain, semsi mountain, open up  The mountain opened, and he went inside it  There lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he did not know which to grab first  At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry  He wished to carry his burden outside, but as his heart and soul were entirely full of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried, simeli mountain, simeli mountain, open up  That, however, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred, but remained shut  Then he was alarmed, and the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and all his treasures were of no help to him  "Rabba, Rabba, silly, silly Rabba, have you caught another whale to-day?" With this strange cry a number of children followed an elderly man through the streets of a town in the East  Their parents looked on in amusement and some of them called after the man as the little ones did  Rabba, however, took no notice, but walked straight on with a faraway look in his eyes, as if his thoughts were elsewhere  Presently, on turning the corner of a street, he nearly ran into an Arab coming in the opposite direction  As soon as the children saw the Arab they turned and fled  "Ali Rabba is coming," they cried to one another in warning, and as fast as their legs would carry them they made off to their homes  The Arab shook his fist threateningly after the children  Then he turned to the man whom they had followed  "It is a shame," he said, hotly, "that the impudent ragamuffins of the town should be allowed to cast words of disrespect in the public streets at my sainted master, Rabba bar Chana, the man of profound learning and the famous traveller--" "Be gentle, good Ali," interrupted Rabba  "Remember they are little more than babes and have not full understanding  And how can they be respectful when their parents, who should have wisdom and faith, accept not our stories of the many adventures we have had? Yesterday, I told them of the day when our ship had been surrounded by five thousand whales, each a mile long, and they jeered and cried \'Impossible!\'" "Impossible!" echoed Ali, in a rage  "Was I not there with thee, my master? Did I not count every single whale myself? Who dares to doubt my word? Have I not, for years, been thy faithful guide on thy marvelous journeys? Bah! What know these town fools, whose lives are no wider than the narrow streets in which they dwell, of the wonders of the vast world beyond the seas? Fools, ignorant fools, every one of them, my good master  Why stay you here with them and brook their insults and their sneers? Let us journey forth again this very day  A good ship waits in the harbor " Ali\'s voice grew louder as his rage became stronger and a crowd was collecting  Rabba hurried him away and together they made for the harbor  There they were soon engaged in earnest conversation with the captain of a vessel that had come from a distant land  "I shall be glad to have two such famous travelers on my ship," said the captain  "I have heard of your adventures, and in my country \'tis said that only those meet with wonders who dare to seek them and believe in them  I, too, would see the wonders of the world, and gladly will I give you passage on my ship " Next day Rabba and Ali stood on the deck of the vessel as the sail was hoisted, and it moved slowly from the harbor to the accompaniment of cheering and some laughter from a crowd on shore  "Silly Rabba and Ali Rabba, don\'t forget to bring back the moon," they cried  "Find out where it goes when it is not here " Soon the land was out of sight, and scudding before favorable breezes the ship made good progress  In ten days it had reached a sea in which no vessel had ever sailed before  Ali said he could tell this because the fishes behaved queerly  They poked their heads out of the water to gaze at the ship and then darted swiftly out of sight again  It was quite plain that they had never before seen a ship, and they evidently mistook it for some strange sea monster  Every day the fishes grew larger, but no land was sighted until another five days had passed  Then a desert island appeared straight ahead, and the captain steered toward it  It must be a marvel to you how, after having five times met with shipwreck and unheard of perils, I could again tempt fortune and risk fresh trouble  I am even surprised myself when I look back, but evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of repose I prepared to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreaties of my friends and relations, who did all they could to keep me at home  Instead of going by the Persian Gulf, I travelled a considerable way overland, and finally embarked from a distant Indian port with a captain who meant to make a long voyage  And truly he did so, for we fell in with stormy weather which drove us completely out of our course, so that for many days neither captain nor pilot knew where we were, nor where we were going  When they did at last discover our position we had small ground for rejoicing, for the captain, casting his turban upon the deck and tearing his beard, declared that we were in the most dangerous spot upon the whole wide sea, and had been caught by a current which was at that minute sweeping us to destruction  It was too true! In spite of all the sailors could do we were driven with frightful rapidity towards the foot of a mountain, which rose sheer out of the sea, and our vessel was dashed to pieces upon the rocks at its base, not, however, until we had managed to scramble on shore, carrying with us the most precious of our possessions  When we had done this the captain said to us: "Now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once, since from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever returned " This speech discouraged us much, and we began to lament over our sad fate  The mountain formed the seaward boundary of a large island, and the narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewn with the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bones of the luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we shuddered to think how soon our own would be added to the heap  All around, too, lay vast quantities of the costliest merchandise, and treasures were heaped in every cranny of the rocks, but all these things only added to the desolation of the scene  It struck me as a very strange thing that a river of clear fresh water, which gushed out from the mountain not far from where we stood, instead of flowing into the sea as rivers generally do, turned off sharply, and flowed out of sight under a natural archway of rock, and when I went to examine it more closely I found that inside the cave the walls were thick with diamonds, and rubies, and masses of crystal, and the floor was strewn with ambergris  Here, then, upon this desolate shore we abandoned ourselves to our fate, for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain, and if a ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom', " The first thing our captain did was to divide equally amongst us all the food we possessed, and then the length of each man's life depended on the time he could make his portion last", ' I myself could live upon very little  Nevertheless, by the time I had buried the last of my companions my stock of provisions was so small that I hardly thought I should live long enough to dig my own grave, which I set about doing, while I regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was always bringing me into such straits, and thought longingly of all the comfort and luxury that I had left  But luckily for me the fancy took me to stand once more beside the river where it plunged out of sight in the depths of the cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me  This river which hid itself underground doubtless emerged again at some distant spot  Why should I not build a raft and trust myself to its swiftly flowing waters? If I perished before I could reach the light of day once more I should be no worse off than I was now, for death stared me in the face, while there was always the possibility that, as I was born under a lucky star, I might find myself safe and sound in some desirable land  I decided at any rate to risk it, and speedily built myself a stout raft of drift-wood with strong cords, of which enough and to spare lay strewn upon the beach  I then made up many packages of rubies, emeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and bound them upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and then I seated myself upon it, having two small oars that I had fashioned laid ready to my hand, and loosed the cord which held it to the bank  Once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the gloomy archway, and I found myself in total darkness, carried smoothly forward by the rapid river  On I went as it seemed to me for many nights and days  Once the channel became so small that I had a narrow escape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that I took the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales  Though I only ate what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive, the inevitable moment came when, after swallowing my last morsel of food, I began to wonder if I must after all die of hunger  Then, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep, and when I again opened my eyes I was once more in the light of day; a beautiful country lay before me, and my raft, which was tied to the river bank, was surrounded by friendly looking black men  I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to me in return, but I could not understand a word of their language  Feeling perfectly bewildered by my sudden return to life and light, I murmured to myself in Arabic, "Close thine eyes, and while thou sleepest Heaven will change thy fortune from evil to good " One of the natives, who understood this tongue, then came forward saying: "My brother, be not surprised to see us; this is our land, and as we came to get water from the river we noticed your raft floating down it, and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore  We have waited for your awakening; tell us now whence you come and where you were going by that dangerous way?" I replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them, but that I was starving, and would fain eat something first  I was soon supplied with all I needed, and having satisfied my hunger I told them faithfully all that had befallen me There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage  In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses  She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called snow-white, and the other rose-red  They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only snow-white was more quiet and gentle than rose-red  Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies, but snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do  The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when snow-white said, we will not leave each other, rose-red answered, never so long as we live, and their mother would add, what one has she must share with the other  They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully  The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew  No mishap overtook them, if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not worry on their account  Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed  He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest  And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further  And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children', " Snow-white and rose-red kept their mother's little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it", " In the summer rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother's bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree", ' In the winter snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob  The kettle was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished  In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, go, snow-white, and bolt the door, and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and spun  And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings  One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in  The mother said, quick, rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveler who is seeking shelter  Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not  It was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door', " Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and snow-white hid herself behind her mother's bed", ' But the bear began to speak and said, do not be afraid, I will do you no harm  I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you  Poor bear, said the mother, lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat  Then she cried, snow-white, rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well  So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him  The bear said, here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little  A poor widow once lived in a little cottage  In front of the cottage was a garden, in which were growing two rose trees; one of these bore white roses, and the other red  She had two children, who resembled the rose trees  One was called Snow-White, and the other Rose-Red; and they were as religious and loving, busy and untiring, as any two children ever were  Snow-White was more gentle, and quieter than her sister, who liked better skipping about the fields, seeking flowers, and catching summer birds; while Snow-White stayed at home with her mother, either helping her in her work, or, when that was done, reading aloud  The two children had the greatest affection the one for the other  They were always seen hand in hand; and should Snow-White say to her sister, "We will never separate," the other would reply, "Not while we live," the mother adding, "That which one has, let her always share with the other " They constantly ran together in the woods, collecting ripe berries; but not a single animal would have injured them; quite the reverse, they all felt the greatest esteem for the young creatures  The hare came to eat parsley from their hands, the deer grazed by their side, the stag bounded past them unheeding; the birds, likewise, did not stir from the bough, but sang in entire security  No mischance befell them; if benighted in the wood, they lay down on the moss to repose and sleep till the morning; and their mother was satisfied as to their safety, and felt no fear about them  Once, when they had spent the night in the wood, and the bright sunrise awoke them, they saw a beautiful child, in a snow-white robe, shining like diamonds, sitting close to the spot where they had reposed  She arose when they opened their eyes, and looked kindly at them; but said no word, and passed from their sight into the wood  When the children looked around they saw they had been sleeping on the edge of a precipice, and would surely have fallen over if they had gone forward two steps further in the darkness  Their mother said the beautiful child must have been the angel who keeps watch over good children', " Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their mother's cottage so clean that it gave pleasure only to look in", ' In summer-time Rose-Red attended to the house, and every morning, before her mother awoke, placed by her bed a bouquet which had in it a rose from each of the rose-trees  In winter-time Snow-White set light to the fire, and put on the kettle, after polishing it until it was like gold for brightness  In the evening, when snow was falling, her mother would bid her bolt the door, and then, sitting by the hearth, the good widow would read aloud to them from a big book while the little girls were spinning  Close by them lay a lamb, and a white pigeon, with its head tucked under its wing, was on a perch behind  One evening, as they were all sitting cosily together like this, there was a knock at the door, as if someone wished to come in  "Make haste, Rose-Red!" said her mother; "open the door; it is surely some traveller seeking shelter " Rose-Red accordingly pulled back the bolt, expecting to see some poor man  But it was nothing of the kind; it was a bear, that thrust his big, black head in at the open door', " Rose-Red cried out and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered her wings, and Snow-White hid herself behind her mother's bed", ' The bear began speaking, and said, "Do not be afraid; I will not do you any harm; I am half-frozen and would like to warm myself a little at your fire " "Poor bear!" the mother replied; "come in and lie by the fire; only be careful that your hair is not burnt " Then she called Snow-White and Rose-Red, telling them that the bear was kind, and would not harm them  They came, as she bade them, and presently the lamb and the dove drew near also without fear  "Children," begged the bear; "knock some of the snow off my coat " So they brought the broom and brushed the bear\'s coat quite clean  ONCE upon a time, in the middle of winter when the snow-flakes were falling like feathers on the earth, a Queen sat at a window framed in black ebony and sewed', " And as she sewed and gazed out to the white landscape, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell on the snow outside, and because the red showed out so well against the white she thought to herself: 'Oh! what wouldn't I give to have a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony!' And her wish was granted, for not long after a little daughter was born to her, with a skin as white as snow, lips and cheeks as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony", ' They called her Snowdrop, and not long after her birth the Queen died  After a year the King married again', " His new wife was a beautiful woman, but so proud and overbearing that she couldn't stand any rival to her beauty", " She possessed a magic mirror, and when she used to stand before it gazing at her own reflection and ask:    'Mirror, mirror, hanging there,   Who in all the land's most fair?' it always replied:    'You are most fair, my Lady Queen,   None fairer in the land, I ween", "' Then she was quite happy, for she knew the mirror always spoke the truth", ' But Snowdrop was growing prettier and prettier every day, and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as she could be, and fairer even than the Queen herself', " One day when the latter asked her mirror the usual question, it replied:   'My Lady Queen, you are fair, 'tis true,   But Snowdrop is fairer far than you", "' Then the Queen flew into the most awful passion, and turned every shade of green in her jealousy", ' From this hour she hated poor Snowdrop like poison, and every day her envy, hatred, and malice grew, for envy and jealousy are like evil weeds which spring up and choke the heart', " At last she could endure Snowdrop's presence no longer, and, calling a huntsman to her, she said: 'Take the child out into the wood, and never let me see her face again", ' You must kill her, and bring me back her lungs and liver, that I may know for certain she is dead', "' The Huntsman did as he was told and led Snowdrop out into the wood, but as he was in the act of drawing out his knife to slay her, she began to cry, and said: 'Oh, dear Huntsman, spare my life, and I will promise to fly forth into the wide wood and never to return home again", "' And because she was so young and pretty the Huntsman had pity on her, and said: 'Well, run along, poor child", "' For he thought to himself: 'The wild beasts will soon eat her up", "' And his heart felt lighter because he hadn't had to do the deed himself", ' And as he turned away a young boar came running past, so he shot it, and brought its lungs and liver home to the Queen as a proof that Snowdrop was really dead  And the wicked woman had them stewed in salt, and ate them up, thinking she had made an end of Snowdrop for ever', " Now when the poor child found herself alone in the big wood the very trees around her seemed to assume strange shapes, and she felt so frightened she didn't know what to do", ' Then she began to run over the sharp stones, and through the bramble bushes, and the wild beasts ran past her, but they did her no harm  She ran as far as her legs would carry her, and as evening approached she saw a little house, and she stepped inside to rest  Everything was very small in the little house, but cleaner and neater than anything you can imagine  In the middle of the room there stood a little table, covered with a white tablecloth, and seven little plates and forks and spoons and knives and tumblers  Side by side against the wall there were seven little beds, covered with snow-white counterpanes  Snowdrop felt so hungry and so thirsty that she ate a bit of bread and a little porridge from each plate, and drank a drop of wine out of each tumbler', " Then feeling tired and sleepy she lay down on one of the beds, but it wasn't comfortable; then she tried all the others in turn, but one was too long, and another too short, and it was only when she got to the seventh that she found one to suit her exactly", ' So she lay down upon it, said her prayers like a good child, and fell fast asleep  When it got quite dark the masters of the little house returned  They were seven dwarfs who worked in the mines, right down deep in the heart of the mountain  Once upon a time there lived a peasant called Ivan, and he had a wife whose name was Marie  They would have been quite happy except for one thing: they had no children to play with, and as they were now old people they did not find that watching the children of their neighbours at all made up to them for having one of their own  One winter, which nobody living will ever forget, the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man  When it had all fallen, and the sun was shining again, the children ran out into the street to play, and the old man and his wife sat at their window and gazed at them  The children first made a sort of little terrace, and stamped it hard and firm, and then they began to make a snow woman  Ivan and Marie watched them, the while thinking about many things', " Suddenly Ivan's face brightened, and, looking at his wife, he said, 'Wife, why shouldn't we make a snow woman too?' 'Why not?' replied Marie, who happened to be in a very good temper; 'it might amuse us a little", ' But there is no use making a woman  Let us make a little snow child, and pretend it is a living one', "' 'Yes, let us do that,' said Ivan, and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife", ' Then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow  They shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet  On top of all they placed a ball of snow, out of which the head was to be', " 'What in the world are you doing?' asked a passer-by", " 'Can't you guess?' returned Ivan", " 'Making a snow-child,' replied Marie", ' They had finished the nose and the chin  Two holes were left for the eyes, and Ivan carefully shaped out the mouth  No sooner had he done so than he felt a warm breath upon his cheek', " He started back in surprise and looked--and behold! the eyes of the child met his, and its lips, which were as red as raspberries, smiled at him! 'What is it?' cried Ivan, crossing himself", " 'Am I mad, or is the thing bewitched?' The snow-child bent its head as if it had been really alive", ' It moved its little arms and its little legs in the snow that lay about it just as the living children did theirs', " 'Ah! Ivan, Ivan,' exclaimed Marie, trembling with joy, 'heaven has sent us a child at last!' And she threw herself upon Snowflake (for that was the snow-child's name) and covered her with kisses", ' And the loose snow fell away from Snowflake as an egg shell does from an egg, and it was a little girl whom Marie held in her arms', " 'Oh! my darling Snowflake!' cried the old woman, and led her into the cottage", ' And Snowflake grew fast; each hour as well as each day made a difference, and every day she became more and more beautiful  The old couple hardly knew how to contain themselves for joy, and thought of nothing else  The cottage was always full of village children, for they amused Snowflake, and there was nothing in the world they would not have done to amuse her  She was their doll, and they were continually inventing new dresses for her, and teaching her songs or playing with her  Nobody knew how clever she was! She noticed everything, and could learn a lesson in a moment  "I mean to be somebody, and do something useful in the world," said the eldest of five brothers  "I don\'t care how humble my position is, so that I can only do some good, which will be something  I intend to be a brickmaker; bricks are always wanted, and I shall be really doing something " "Your \'something\' is not enough for me," said the second brother; "what you talk of doing is nothing at all, it is journeyman\'s work, or might even be done by a machine  No! I should prefer to be a builder at once, there is something real in that  A man gains a position, he becomes a citizen, has his own sign, his own house of call for his workmen: so I shall be a builder', " If all goes well, in time I shall become a master, and have my own journeymen, and my wife will be treated as a master's wife", ' This is what I call something " "I call it all nothing," said the third; "not in reality any position  There are many in a town far above a master builder in position  You may be an upright man, but even as a master you will only be ranked among common men  I know better what to do than that  I will be an architect, which will place me among those who possess riches and intellect, and who speculate in art', " I shall certainly have to rise by my own endeavors from a bricklayer's laborer, or as a carpenter's apprentice--a lad wearing a paper cap, although I now wear a silk hat", " I shall have to fetch beer and spirits for the journeymen, and they will call me 'thou,' which will be an insult", ' I shall endure it, however, for I shall look upon it all as a mere representation, a masquerade, a mummery, which to-morrow, that is, when I myself as a journeyman, shall have served my time, will vanish, and I shall go my way, and all that has passed will be nothing to me  Then I shall enter the academy, and get instructed in drawing, and be called an architect  I may even attain to rank, and have something placed before or after my name, and I shall build as others have done before me  By this there will be always \'something\' to make me remembered, and is not that worth living for?" "Not in my opinion," said the fourth; "I will never follow the lead of others, and only imitate what they have done  I will be a genius, and become greater than all of you together  I will create a new style of building, and introduce a plan for erecting houses suitable to the climate, with material easily obtained in the country, and thus suit national feeling and the developments of the age, besides building a storey for my own genius " "But supposing the climate and the material are not good for much," said the fifth brother, "that would be very unfortunate for you, and have an influence over your experiments  Nationality may assert itself until it becomes affectation, and the developments of a century may run wild, as youth often does  I see clearly that none of you will ever really be anything worth notice, however you may now fancy it  But do as you like, I shall not imitate you  I mean to keep clear of all these things, and criticize what you do  In every action something imperfect may be discovered, something not right, which I shall make it my business to find out and expose; that will be something, I fancy " And he kept his word, and became a critic  People said of this fifth brother, "There is something very precise about him; he has a good head-piece, but he does nothing " And on that very account they thought he must be something  THERE was once upon a time a couple of folks who had a son called Halvor  Ever since he had been a little boy he had been unwilling to do any work, and had just sat raking about among the ashes  His parents sent him away to learn several things, but Halvor stayed nowhere, for when he had been gone two or three days he always ran away from his master, hurried off home, and sat down in the chimney corner to grub among the ashes again', " One day, however, a sea captain came and asked Halvor if he hadn't a fancy to come with him and go to sea, and behold foreign lands", ' And Halvor had a fancy for that, so he was not long in getting ready  How long they sailed I have no idea, but after a long, long time there was a terrible storm, and when it was over and all had become calm again, they knew not where they were, for they had been driven away to a strange coast of which none of them had any knowledge  As there was no wind at all they lay there becalmed, and Halvor asked the skipper to give him leave to go on shore to look about him, for he would much rather do that than lie there and sleep', " 'Dost thou think that thou art fit to go where people can see thee?' said the skipper; 'thou hast no clothes but those rags thou art going about in!' Halvor still begged for leave, and at last got it, but he was to come back at once if the wind began to rise", ' So he went on shore, and it was a delightful country; whithersoever he went there were wide plains with fields and meadows, but as for people, there were none to be seen  The wind began to rise, but Halvor thought that he had not seen enough yet, and that he would like to walk about a little longer, to try if he could not meet somebody  So after a while he came to a great highway, which was so smooth that an egg might have been rolled along it without breaking  Halvor followed this, and when evening drew near he saw a big castle far away in the distance, and there were lights in it  So as he had now been walking the whole day and had not brought anything to eat away with him, he was frightfully hungry  Nevertheless, the nearer he came to the castle the more afraid he was  A fire was burning in the castle, and Halvor went into the kitchen, which was more magnificent than any kitchen he had ever yet beheld  There were vessels of gold and silver, but not one human being was to be seen  When Halvor had stood there for some time, and no one had come out, he went in and opened a door, and inside a Princess was sitting at her wheel spinning', " 'Nay!' she cried, 'can Christian folk dare to come hither? But the best thing that you can do is to go away again, for if not the Troll will devour you", ' A Troll with three heads lives here', "' 'I should have been just as well pleased if he had had four heads more, for I should have enjoyed seeing the fellow,' said the youth; 'and I won't go away, for I have done no harm, but you must give me something to eat, for I am frightfully hungry", "' When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could wield the sword which was hanging on the wall, but he could not wield it, nor could he even lift it up", " 'Well, then, you must take a drink out of that bottle which is hanging by its side, for that's what the Troll does whenever he goes out and wants to use the sword,' said the Princess", ' Halvor took a draught, and in a moment he was able to swing the sword about with perfect ease  And now he thought it was high time for the Troll to make his appearance, and at that very moment he came, panting for breath  Halvor got behind the door', " 'Hutetu!' said the Troll as he put his head in at the door", " 'It smells just as if there were Christian man's blood here!' 'Yes, you shall learn that there is!' said Halvor, and cut off all his heads", " The Princess was so rejoiced to be free that she danced and sang, but then she remembered her sisters, and said: 'If my sisters were but free too!' 'Where are they?' asked Halvor", ' So she told him where they were  One of them had been taken away by a Troll to his castle, which was six miles off, and the other had been carried off to a castle which was nine miles farther off still  "We had such an excellent dinner yesterday," said an old mouse of the female sex to another who had not been present at the feast  "I sat number twenty-one below the mouse-king, which was not a bad place  Shall I tell you what we had? Everything was first rate  Mouldy bread, tallow candle, and sausage  And then, when we had finished that course, the same came on all over again; it was as good as two feasts  We were very sociable, and there was as much joking and fun as if we had been all of one family circle', " Nothing was left but the sausage skewers, and this formed a subject of conversation, till at last it turned to the proverb, 'Soup from sausage skins;' or, as the people in the neighboring country call it, 'Soup from a sausage skewer", "' Every one had heard the proverb, but no one had ever tasted the soup, much less prepared it", ' A capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the soup, and some one said he ought to be made a relieving officer to the poor  Was not that witty? Then the old mouse-king rose and promised that the young lady-mouse who should learn how best to prepare this much-admired and savory soup should be his queen, and a year and a day should be allowed for the purpose " "That was not at all a bad proposal," said the other mouse; "but how is the soup made?" "Ah, that is more than I can tell you  All the young lady mice were asking the same question  They wished very much to be queen, but they did not want to take the trouble of going out into the world to learn how to make soup, which was absolutely necessary to be done first  But it is not every one who would care to leave her family, or her happy corner by the fire-side at home, even to be made queen  It is not always easy to find bacon and cheese-rind in foreign lands every day, and it is not pleasant to have to endure hunger, and be perhaps, after all, eaten up alive by the cat " Most probably some such thoughts as these discouraged the majority from going out into the world to collect the required information  Only four mice gave notice that they were ready to set out on the journey  They were young and lively, but poor  Each of them wished to visit one of the four divisions of the world, so that it might be seen which was the most favored by fortune', " Every one took a sausage skewer as a traveller's staff, and to remind them of the object of their journey", ' They left home early in May, and none of them returned till the first of May in the following year, and then only three of them  Nothing was seen or heard of the fourth, although the day of decision was close at hand  "Ah, yes, there is always some trouble mixed up with the greatest pleasure," said the mouse-king; but he gave orders that all the mice within a circle of many miles should be invited at once  They were to assemble in the kitchen, and the three travelled mice were to stand in a row before them, while a sausage skewer, covered with crape, was to be stuck up instead of the missing mouse  No one dared to express an opinion until the king spoke, and desired one of them to go on with her story  And now we shall hear what she said      Warmer the sun shone, and warmer yet  The pines were green now  All the snow had melted off them, drip, drip, the falling drops of water making tiny wells in the snow under the trees  And the snow under the trees was melting too  Much had gone, and now there were only patches of snow in the forest--like scraps of a big white blanket, shrinking every day  "Isn\'t it lucky our blankets don\'t shrink like that?" said Maroosia  Old Peter laughed  "What do you do when the warm weather comes?" he asked  "Do you still wear sheepskin coats? Do you still roll up at night under the rugs?" "No," said Maroosia; "I throw the rugs off, and put my fluffy coat away till next winter " "Well," said old Peter, "and God, the Father of us all, He does for the earth just what you do for yourself; but He does it better  For the blankets He gives the earth in winter get smaller and smaller as the warm weather comes, little by little, day by day " "And then a hard frost comes, grandfather," said Ivan  "God knows all about that, little one," said old Peter, "and it\'s for the best', " It's good to have a nip or two in the spring, to make you feel alive", " Perhaps it's His way of telling the earth to wake up", ' For the whole earth is only His little one after all " That night, when it was story-time, Ivan and Maroosia consulted together; and when old Peter asked what the story was to be, they were ready with an answer  "The snow is all melting away," said Ivan  "The summer is coming," said Maroosia  "We\'d like the tale of the little snow girl," said Ivan  "\'The Little Daughter of the Snow,\'" said Maroosia  Old Peter shook out his pipe, and closed his eyes under his bushy eyebrows, thinking for a minute  Then he began      The spring so dear to all creatures, young and old, came at last, and before the first few days of it had gone, the king rode through its budding valleys to see his little daughter  He had been in a distant part of his dominions all the winter, for he was not in the habit of stopping in one great city, or of visiting only his favourite country houses, but he moved from place to place, that all his people might know him  Wherever he journeyed, he kept a constant look-out for the ablest and best men to put into office; and wherever he found himself mistaken, and those he had appointed incapable or unjust, he removed them at once  Hence you see it was his care of the people that kept him from seeing his princess so often as he would have liked  You may wonder why he did not take her about with him; but there were several reasons against his doing so, and I suspect her great-great-grandmother had had a principal hand in preventing it  Once more Irene heard the bugle-blast, and once more she was at the gate to meet her father as he rode up on his great white horse  After they had been alone for a little while, she thought of what she had resolved to ask him', " 'Please, king-papa,' she said, 'Will you tell me where I got this pretty ring? I can't remember", "' The king looked at it", " A strange beautiful smile spread like sunshine over his face, and an answering smile, but at the same time a questioning one, spread like moonlight over Irene's", " 'It was your queen-mamma's once,' he said", " 'And why isn't it hers now?' asked Irene", " 'She does not want it now,' said the king, looking grave", " 'Why doesn't she want it now?' 'Because she's gone where all those rings are made", "' 'And when shall I see her?' asked the princess", " 'Not for some time yet,' answered the king, and the tears came into his eyes", ' Irene did not remember her mother and did not know why her father looked so, and why the tears came in his eyes; but she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and asked no more questions  The king was much disturbed on hearing the report of the gentlemen-at-arms concerning the creatures they had seen; and I presume would have taken Irene with him that very day, but for what the presence of the ring on her finger assured him of  About an hour before he left, Irene saw him go up the old stair; and he did not come down again till they were just ready to start; and she thought with herself that he had been up to see the old lady  When he went away he left other six gentlemen behind him, that there might be six of them always on guard  And now, in the lovely spring weather, Irene was out on the mountain the greater part of the day  In the warmer hollows there were lovely primroses, and not so many that she ever got tired of them  As often as she saw a new one opening an eye of light in the blind earth, she would clap her hands with gladness, and unlike some children I know, instead of pulling it, would touch it as tenderly as if it had been a new baby, and, having made its acquaintance, would leave it as happy as she found it', " She treated the plants on which they grew like birds' nests; every fresh flower was like a new little bird to her", ' She would pay visits to all the flower-nests she knew, remembering each by itself', " She would go down on her hands and knees beside one and say: 'Good morning! Are you all smelling very sweet this morning? Good-bye!' and then she would go to another nest, and say the same", ' It was a favourite amusement with her  There were many flowers up and down, and she loved them all, but the primroses were her favourites', " 'They're not too shy, and they're not a bit forward,' she would say to Lootie", ' There were goats too about, over the mountain, and when the little kids came she was as pleased with them as with the flowers There was once on a time a mother who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was rude and wicked, the second much better, although she had her faults, but the youngest was a pious, good child  The mother, however, was so strange, that it was just the eldest daughter whom she most loved, and she could not bear the youngest  On this account, she often sent the poor girl out into the great forest in order to get rid of her, for she thought she would lose herself and never come back again  But the guardian-angel which every good child has, did not forsake her, but always brought her into the right path again  Once, however, the guardian-angel behaved as if he were not there, and the child could not find her way out of the forest again  She walked on constantly until evening came, and then she saw a tiny light burning in the distance, ran up to it at once, and came to a little hut  She knocked, the door opened, and she came to a second door, where she knocked again  An old man, who had a snow-white beard and looked venerable, opened it for her  And he was no other than St  Joseph  He said quite kindly, come, dear child, seat yourself on my little chair by the fire, and warm yourself  I will fetch you clear water if you are thirsty  But here in the forest, I have nothing for you to eat but a couple of little roots, which you must first scrape and boil  St  Joseph gave her the roots  The girl scraped them clean, then she brought a piece of pancake and the bread that her mother had given her to take with her, mixed all together in a pan, and cooked herself a thick soup  When it was ready, St  Joseph said, I am so hungry, give me some of your food', " The child was quite willing, and gave him more than she kept for herself, but God's blessing was with her, so that she was satisfied", ' When they had eaten, St  Joseph said, now we will go to bed  I have, however, only one bed, lay your self in it  I will lie on the ground on the straw  No, answered she, stay in your own bed, the straw is soft enough for me  But St  Joseph took the child in his arms, and carried her into the little bed, and there she said her prayers, and fell asleep  Next morning when she awoke, she wanted to say good morning to St  Joseph, but she did not see him  Then she got up and looked for him, but could not find him anywhere  At last she perceived, behind the door, a bag with money so heavy that she could just carry it, and on it was written that it was for the child who had slept there that night  Once upon a time what happened did happen, and if it had not happened this story would never have been told  On the outskirts of a village just where the oxen were turned out to pasture, and the pigs roamed about burrowing with their noses among the roots of the trees, there stood a small house  In the house lived a man who had a wife, and the wife was sad all day long', " 'Dear wife, what is wrong with you that you hang your head like a drooping rosebud?' asked her husband one morning", " 'You have everything you want; why cannot you be merry like other women?' 'Leave me alone, and do not seek to know the reason,' replied she, bursting into tears, and the man thought that it was no time to question her, and went away to his work", ' He could not, however, forget all about it, and a few days after he inquired again the reason of her sadness, but only got the same reply  At length he felt he could bear it no longer, and tried a third time, and then his wife turned and answered him', " 'Good gracious!' cried she, 'why cannot you let things be as they are? If I were to tell you, you would become just as wretched as myself", ' If you would only believe, it is far better for you to know nothing', "' But no man yet was ever content with such an answer", ' The more you beg him not to inquire, the greater is his curiosity to learn the whole', " 'Well, if you MUST know,' said the wife at last, 'I will tell you", " There is no luck in this house--no luck at all!' 'Is not your cow the best milker in all the village? Are not your trees as full of fruit as your hives are full of bees? Has anyone cornfields like ours? Really you talk nonsense when you say things like that!' 'Yes, all that you say is true, but we have no children", "' Then Stan understood, and when a man once understands and has his eyes opened it is no longer well with him", ' From that day the little house in the outskirts contained an unhappy man as well as an unhappy woman', " And at the sight of her husband's misery the woman became more wretched than ever", ' And so matters went on for some time', " Some weeks had passed, and Stan thought he would consult a wise man who lived a day's journey from his own house", ' The wise man was sitting before his door when he came up, and Stan fell on his knees before him', " 'Give me children, my lord, give me children", "' 'Take care what you are asking,' replied the wise man", " 'Will not children be a burden to you? Are you rich enough to feed and clothe them?' 'Only give them to me, my lord, and I will manage somehow!' and at a sign from the wise man Stan went his way", ' He reached home that evening tired and dusty, but with hope in his heart  As he drew near his house a sound of voices struck upon his ear, and he looked up to see the whole place full of children  Children in the garden, children in the yard, children looking out of every window--it seemed to the man as if all the children in the world must be gathered there  And none was bigger than the other, but each was smaller than the other, and every one was more noisy and more impudent and more daring than the rest, and Stan gazed and grew cold with horror as he realised that they all belonged to him', " 'Good gracious! how many there are! how many!' he muttered to himself", " 'Oh, but not one too many,' smiled his wife, coming up with a crowd more children clinging to her skirts", " But even she found that it was not so easy to look after a hundred children, and when a few days had passed and they had eaten up all the food there was in the house, they began to cry, 'Father! I am hungry--I am hungry,' till Stan scratched his head and wondered what he was to do next", ' It was not that he thought there were too many children, for his life had seemed more full of joy since they appeared, but now it came to the point he did not know how he was to feed them There was once a little child whose mother gave her every afternoon a small bowl of milk and bread, and the child seated herself in the yard with it  But when she began to eat, a paddock came creeping out of a crevice in the wall, dipped its little head in the dish, and ate with her  The child took pleasure in this, and when she was sitting there with her little dish and the paddock did not come at once, she cried,        paddock, paddock, come swiftly        hither come, thou tiny thing,        thou shalt have thy crumbs of bread,        thou shalt refresh thyself with milk  Then the paddock came in haste, and enjoyed its food  It even showed gratitude, for it brought the child all kinds of pretty things from its hidden treasures, bright stones, pearls, and golden playthings  The paddock, however, drank only the milk, and left the bread-crumbs alone  Then one day the child took its little spoon and struck the paddock gently on its head, and said, eat the bread-crumbs as well, little thing  The mother, who was standing in the kitchen, heard the child talking to someone, and when she saw that she was striking a paddock with her spoon, ran out with a log of wood, and killed the good little creature  From that time forth, a change came over the child  As long as the paddock had eaten with her, she had grown tall and strong, but now she lost her pretty rosy cheeks and wasted away  It was not long before the funeral bird began to cry in the night, and the redbreast to collect little branches and leaves for a funeral wreath and soon afterwards the child lay on her bier               II An orphan child was sitting by the town walls spinning, when she saw a paddock coming out of a hole low down in the wall  Swiftly she spread out beside it one of the blue silk handkerchiefs for which paddocks have such a strong liking, and which are the only things they will creep on  As soon as the paddock saw it, it went back, then returned, bringing with it a small golden crown, laid it on the handkerchief, and then went away again  The girl took up the crown, which glittered and was of delicate golden filagree work  It was not long before the paddock came back for the second time, but when it did not see the crown any more, it crept up to the wall, and in its grief smote its little head against it as long as it had strength to do so, until at last it lay there dead  If the girl had but left the crown where it was, the paddock would certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of the hole               III The paddock cries, huhu, huhu  The child says, come out  The paddock comes out, whereupon the child inquires about her little sister, have you not seen little red-stockings  The paddock says, no, I have not  Have you  Huhu, huhu, huhu    Many years ago there lived an Emperor who was so fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on them in order to be beautifully dressed  He did not care about his soldiers, he did not care about the theatre; he only liked to go out walking to show off his new clothes', " He had a coat for every hour of the day; and just as they say of a king, 'He is in the council-chamber,' they always said here, 'The Emperor is in the wardrobe", "' In the great city in which he lived there was always something going on; every day many strangers came there", ' One day two impostors arrived who gave themselves out as weavers, and said that they knew how to manufacture the most beautiful cloth imaginable  Not only were the texture and pattern uncommonly beautiful, but the clothes which were made of the stuff possessed this wonderful property that they were invisible to anyone who was not fit for his office, or who was unpardonably stupid', " 'Those must indeed be splendid clothes,' thought the Emperor", " 'If I had them on I could find out which men in my kingdom are unfit for the offices they hold; I could distinguish the wise from the stupid! Yes, this cloth must be woven for me at once", "' And he gave both the impostors much money, so that they might begin their work", ' They placed two weaving-looms, and began to do as if they were working, but they had not the least thing on the looms  They also demanded the finest silk and the best gold, which they put in their pockets, and worked at the empty looms till late into the night', " 'I should like very much to know how far they have got on with the cloth,' thought the Emperor", ' But he remembered when he thought about it that whoever was stupid or not fit for his office would not be able to see it  Now he certainly believed that he had nothing to fear for himself, but he wanted first to send somebody else in order to see how he stood with regard to his office  Everybody in the whole town knew what a wonderful power the cloth had, and they were all curious to see how bad or how stupid their neighbour was', " 'I will send my old and honoured minister to the weavers,' thought the Emperor", " 'He can judge best what the cloth is like, for he has intellect, and no one understands his office better than he", "' Now the good old minister went into the hall where the two impostors sat working at the empty weaving-looms", " 'Dear me!' thought the old minister, opening his eyes wide, 'I can see nothing!' But he did not say so", ' Both the impostors begged him to be so kind as to step closer, and asked him if it were not a beautiful texture and lovely colours  They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister went forward rubbing his eyes; but he could see nothing, for there was nothing there', " 'Dear, dear!' thought he, 'can I be stupid? I have never thought that, and nobody must know it! Can I be not fit for my office? No, I must certainly not say that I cannot see the cloth!' 'Have you nothing to say about it?' asked one of the men who was weaving", " 'Oh, it is lovely, most lovely!' answered the old minister, looking through his spectacles", " 'What a texture! What colours! Yes, I will tell the Emperor that it pleases me very much", "' 'Now we are delighted at that,' said both the weavers, and thereupon they named the colours and explained the make of the texture", ' The old minister paid great attention, so that he could tell the same to the Emperor when he came back to him, which he did  The impostors now wanted more money, more silk, and more gold to use in their weaving  They put it all in their own pockets, and there came no threads on the loom, but they went on as they had done before, working at the empty loom  The Emperor soon sent another worthy statesman to see how the weaving was getting on, and whether the cloth would soon be finished  It was the same with him as the first one; he looked and looked, but because there was nothing on the empty loom he could see nothing  Once upon a time, far away in the east country, there lived a king who loved hunting so much that, when once there was a deer in sight, he was careless of his own safety  Indeed, he often became quite separated from his nobles and attendants, and in fact was particularly fond of lonely adventures  Another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well, and could not be seen; and then, with the knowledge only of his faithful Grand Wazeer, to disguise himself as a pedlar, load a donkey with cheap wares, and travel about  In this way he found out what the common people said about him, and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties  One day his queen presented him with a baby daughter as beautiful as the dawn, and the king himself was so happy and delighted that, for a whole week, he forgot to hunt, and spent the time in public and private rejoicing  Not long afterwards, however, he went out after some deer which were to be found in a far corner of his forests  In the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snow-white stag, and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost  So he put the spurs to his horse, and followed it as hard as he could gallop  Of course all his attendants followed at the best speed that they could manage; but the king was so splendidly mounted, and the stag was so swift, that, at the end of an hour, the king found that only his favourite hound and himself were in the chase; all the rest were far, far behind and out of sight  Nothing daunted, however, he went on and on, till he perceived that he was entering a valley with great rocky mountains on all sides, and that his horse was getting very tired and trembled at every stride  Worse than all evening was already drawing on, and the sun would soon set  In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag  Every shot fell short, or went wide of the mark; and at last, just as darkness was setting in, he lost sight altogether of the beast  By this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue, his hound staggered panting along beside him, he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before, and had quite missed his way, and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight  All this was very discouraging, but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful stag', " That troubled him a good deal, but he never worried over what he could not help, so he got down from his horse, slipped his arm through the bridle, and led the animal along the rough path in hopes of discovering some shepherd's hut, or, at least, a cave or shelter under some rock, where he might pass the night", ' Presently he heard the sound of rushing water, and made towards it  He toiled over a steep rocky shoulder of a hill, and there, just below him, was a stream dashing down a precipitous glen, and, almost beneath his feet, twinkling and flickering from the level of the torrent, was a dim light as of a lamp  Towards this light the king with his horse and hound made his way, sliding and stumbling down a steep, stony path  At the bottom the king found a narrow grassy ledge by the brink of the stream, across which the light from a rude lantern in the mount of a cave shed a broad beam of uncertain light  At the edge of the stream sat an old hermit with a long white beard, who neither spoke nor moved as the king approached, but sat throwing into the stream dry leaves which lay scattered about the ground near him', " 'Peace be upon you,' said the king, giving the usual country salutation", " 'And upon you peace,' answered the hermit; but still he never looked up, nor stopped what he was doing", ' For a minute or two the king stood watching him  He noticed that the hermit threw two leaves in at a time, and watched them attentively', " Sometimes both were carried rapidly down by the stream; sometimes only one leaf was carried off, and the other, after whirling slowly round and round on the edge of the current, would come circling back on an eddy to the hermit's feet", ' At other times both leaves were held in the backward eddy, and failed to reach the main current of the noisy stream', " 'What are you doing?' asked the king at last, and the hermit replied that he was reading the fates of men; every one's fate, he said, was settled from the beginning, and, whatever it were, there was no escape from it", ' The king laughed', " 'I care little,' he said, 'what my fate may be; but I should be curious to know the fate of my little daughter" ,  ' Once upon a time there was king who, one day out hunting, came upon a fakeer in a lonely place in the mountains  The fakeer was seated on a little old bedstead reading the Koran, with his patched cloak thrown over his shoulders  The king asked him what he was reading; and he said he was reading about Paradise, and praying that he might be worthy to enter there  Then they began to talk, and, by-and- bye, the king asked the fakeer if he could show him a glimpse of Paradise, for he found it very difficult to believe in what he could not see  The fakeer replied that he was asking a very difficult, and perhaps a very dangerous, thing; but that he would pray for him, and perhaps he might be able to do it; only he warned the king both against the dangers of his unbelief, and against the curiosity which prompted him to ask this thing  However, the king was not to be turned from his purpose, and he promised the fakeer always to provided him with food, if he, in return, would pray for him  To this the fakeer agreed, and so they parted', " Time went on, and the king always sent the old fakeer his food according to his promise; but, whenever he sent to ask him when he was going to show him Paradise, the fakeer always replied: 'Not yet, not yet!' After a year or two had passed by, the king heard one day that the fakeer was very ill-- indeed, he was believed to be dying", ' Instantly he hurried off himself, and found that it was really true, and that the fakeer was even then breathing his last  There and then the king besought him to remember his promise, and to show him a glimpse of Paradise  The dying fakeer replied that if the king would come to his funeral, and, when the grave was filled in, and everyone else was gone away, he would come and lay his hand upon the grave, he would keep his word, and show him a glimpse of Paradise  At the same time he implored the king not to do this thing, but to be content to see Paradise when God called him there', " Still the king's curiosity was so aroused that he would not give way", ' Accordingly, after the fakeer was dead, and had been buried, he stayed behind when all the rest went away; and then, when he was quite alone, he stepped forward, and laid his hand upon the grave! Instantly the ground opened, and the astonished king, peeping in, saw a flight of rough steps, and, at the bottom of them, the fakeer sitting, just as he used to sit, on his rickety bedstead, reading the Koran! At first the king was so surprised and frightened that he could only stare; but the fakeer beckoned to him to come down, so, mustering up his courage, he boldly stepped down into the grave  The fakeer rose, and, making a sign to the king to follow, walked a few paces along a dark passage  Then he stopped, turned solemnly to his companion, and, with a movement of his hand, drew aside as it were a heavy curtain, and revealed--what? No one knows what was there shown to the king, nor did he ever tell anyone; but, when the fakeer at length dropped the curtain, and the king turned to leave the place, he had had his glimpse of Paradise! Trembling in every limb, he staggered back along the passage, and stumbled up the steps out of the tomb into the fresh air again  The dawn was breaking  It seemed odd to the king that he had been so long in the grave  It appeared but a few minutes ago that he had descended, passed along a few steps to the place where he had peeped beyond the veil, and returned again after perhaps five minutes of that wonderful view! And what WAS it he had seen? He racked his brains to remember, but he could not call to mind a single thing! How curious everything looked too! Why, his own city, which by now he was entering, seemed changed and strange to him! The sun was already up when he turned into the palace gate and entered the public durbar hall  It was full; and there upon the throne sat another king! The poor king, all bewildered, sat down and stared about him', " Presently a chamberlain came across and asked him why he sat unbidden in the king's presence", " 'But I am the king!' he cried", " 'What king?' said the chamberlain", " 'The true king of this country,' said he indignantly", " Then the chamberlain went away, and spoke to the king who sat on the throne, and the old king heard words like 'mad,' 'age,' 'compassion", "' Then the king on the throne called him to come forward, and, as he went, he caught sight of himself reflected in the polished steel shield of the bodyguard, and started back in horror! He was old, decrepit, dirty, and ragged! His long white beard and locks were unkempt, and straggled all over his chest and shoulders", ' Only one sign of royalty remained to him, and that was the signet ring upon his right hand  He dragged it off with shaking fingers and held it up to the king', " 'Tell me who I am,' he cried; 'there is my signet, who once sat where you sit--even yesterday!' The king looked at him compassionately, and examined the signet with curiosity", ' Then he commanded, and they brought out dusty records and archives of the kingdom, and old coins of previous reigns, and compared them faithfully Which describes a looking-glass and the broken fragments  You must attend to the commencement of this story, for when we get to the end we shall know more than we do now about a very wicked hobgoblin; he was one of the very worst, for he was a real demon  One day, when he was in a merry mood, he made a looking-glass which had the power of making everything good or beautiful that was reflected in it almost shrink to nothing, while everything that was worthless and bad looked increased in size and worse than ever  The most lovely landscapes appeared like boiled spinach, and the people became hideous, and looked as if they stood on their heads and had no bodies  Their countenances were so distorted that no one could recognize them, and even one freckle on the face appeared to spread over the whole of the nose and mouth  The demon said this was very amusing  When a good or pious thought passed through the mind of any one it was misrepresented in the glass; and then how the demon laughed at his cunning invention', " All who went to the demon's school--for he kept a school--talked everywhere of the wonders they had seen, and declared that people could now, for the first time, see what the world and mankind were really like", ' They carried the glass about everywhere, till at last there was not a land nor a people who had not been looked at through this distorted mirror  They wanted even to fly with it up to heaven to see the angels, but the higher they flew the more slippery the glass became, and they could scarcely hold it, till at last it slipped from their hands, fell to the earth, and was broken into millions of pieces  But now the looking-glass caused more unhappiness than ever, for some of the fragments were not so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about the world into every country', " When one of these tiny atoms flew into a person's eye, it stuck there unknown to him, and from that moment he saw everything through a distorted medium, or could see only the worst side of what he looked at, for even the smallest fragment retained the same power which had belonged to the whole mirror", ' Some few persons even got a fragment of the looking-glass in their hearts, and this was very terrible, for their hearts became cold like a lump of ice  A few of the pieces were so large that they could be used as window-panes; it would have been a sad thing to look at our friends through them  Other pieces were made into spectacles; this was dreadful for those who wore them, for they could see nothing either rightly or justly  At all this the wicked demon laughed till his sides shook--it tickled him so to see the mischief he had done  There were still a number of these little fragments of glass floating about in the air, and now you shall hear what happened with one of them     There were once a man and a woman who had an only child, and lived quite alone in a solitary valley  It came to pass that the mother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir, and took with her little Hans, who was just two years old  As it was spring-time, and the child took pleasure in the many-colored flowers, she went still further onwards with him into the forest', " Suddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket, seized the mother and child, and carried them far away into the black forest, where no one ever came from one year's end to another", ' The poor woman urgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free, but their hearts were made of stone, they would not listen to her prayers and entreaties, and drove her on farther by force  After they had worked their way through bushes and briars for about two miles, they came to a rock where there was a door, at which the robbers knocked and it opened at once  They had to go through a long dark passage, which burnt on the hearth  On the wall hung swords, sabres, and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the light, and in the midst stood a black table at which four other robbers were sitting gambling, and the captain sat at the head of it  As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her, and told her to be at ease and have no fear, they would do nothing to hurt her, but she must look after the housekeeping, and if she kept everything in order, she should not fare ill with them  Thereupon they gave her something to eat, and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child  The woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew tall and strong  His mother told him stories, and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave  When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then went to his mother and said, dear mother, pray tell me who is my father  I must and will know  His mother was silent and would not tell him, that he might not become home-sick  Moreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but it almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father  In the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain, and said, I now wish to know who my father is, and if you do not tell me at once I will strike you down  Then the captain laughed, and gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table  Hans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, I will wait another year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then  When the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the dust off it, looked at it well, and said, it is a stout strong club  At night the robbers came home, drank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be heavy  Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before the captain, and asked him who his father was  But the captain again gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled under the table  However, it was not long before he was up again, and so beat the captain and the robbers with his club, that they could no longer move either their arms or their legs  His mother stood in a corner full of admiration for his bravery and strength  When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother, and said, now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I must also know who my father is  Dear Hans, answered the mother, come, we will go and seek him until we find him  She took from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans fetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was full, and then he took it on his back  They left the cave, but how Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and the birds, and the morning sun in the sky  He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he were not quite right in the head There was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her mother, and they no longer had anything to eat  So the child went into the forest, and there an aged woman met her who was aware of her sorrow, and presented her with a little pot, which when she said, cook, little pot, cook, would cook good, sweet porridge, and when she said, stop, little pot, it ceased to cook  The girl took the pot home to her mother, and now they were freed from their poverty and hunger, and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose  Once on a time when the girl had gone out, her mother said, cook, little pot, cook  And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied, and then she wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word  So it went on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge, and still it cooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full, and then the next house, and then the whole street, just as if it wanted to satisfy the hunger of the whole world, and there was the greatest distress, but no one knew how to stop it  At last when only one single house remained, the child came home and just said, stop, little pot, and it stopped and gave up cooking, and whosoever wished to return to the town had to eat his way back   There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated, because she was her step-daughter  The step-daughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron  Be quiet, my child, said the old woman, and you shall have it  Your step-sister has long deserved death, to-night when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off  Only be careful that you are at the far-side of the bed, and push her well to the front  It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything', " All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bed-time had come, the witch's daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall", " In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child's head off", ' When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who was called roland, and knocked at his door  When he came out, she said to him, listen, dearest roland, we must fly in all haste  My step-mother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child  When daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost  But, said roland, I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us', " The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the dead girl's head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs", ' Then she hurried away with her lover  When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come  Then the witch cried, where are you  Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping, answered the first drop of blood  The old woman went out, but saw no one on the stairs, and cried again, where are you  Here in the kitchen, I am warming myself, cried the second drop of blood  She went into the kitchen, but found no one  Then she cried again, where are you  Ah, here in the bed, I am sleeping, cried the third drop of blood  She went into the room to the bed  What did she see there  Her own child, whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood  The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her step-daughter hurrying away with her sweetheart roland  That shall not help you, cried she, even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me', " She put on her many league boots, in which she covered an hour's walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook them", ' The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it  Once upon a time there was a country where the rivers were larger, and the forests deeper, than anywhere else  Hardly any men came there, and the wild creatures had it all to themselves, and used to play all sorts of strange games with each other  The great trees, chained one to the other by thick flowering plants with bright scarlet or yellow blossoms, were famous hiding-places for the monkeys, who could wait unseen, till a puma or an elephant passed by, and then jump on their backs and go for a ride, swinging themselves up by the creepers when they had had enough  Near the rivers huge tortoises were to be found, and though to our eyes a tortoise seems a dull, slow thing, it is wonderful to think how clever they were, and how often they outwitted many of their livelier friends  There was one tortoise in particular that always managed to get the better of everybody, and many were the tales told in the forest of his great deeds  They began when he was quite young, and tired of staying at home with his father and mother  He left them one day, and walked off in search of adventures  In a wide open space surrounded by trees he met with an elephant, who was having his supper before taking his evening bath in the river which ran close by', " 'Let us see which of us two is strongest,' said the young tortoise, marching up to the elephant", " 'Very well,' replied the elephant, much amused at the impertinence of the little creature; 'when would you like the trial to be?' 'In an hour's time; I have some business to do first,' answered the tortoise", ' And he hastened away as fast as his short legs would carry him  In a pool of the river a whale was resting, blowing water into the air and making a lovely fountain  The tortoise, however, was too young and too busy to admire such things, and he called to the whale to stop, as he wanted to speak to him', " 'Would you like to try which of us is the stronger?' said he", " The whale looked at him, sent up another fountain, and answered: 'Oh, yes; certainly", ' When do you wish to begin? I am quite ready', "' 'Then give me one of your longest bones, and I will fasten it to my leg", ' When I give the signal, you must pull, and we will see which can pull the hardest', "' 'Very good,' replied the whale; and he took out one of his bones and passed it to the tortoise", ' The tortoise picked up the end of the bone in his mouth and went back to the elephant', " 'I will fasten this to your leg,' said he, 'in the same way as it is fastened to mine, and we must both pull as hard as we can", ' We shall soon see which is the stronger', "' So he wound it carefully round the elephant's leg, and tied it in a firm knot", " 'Now!' cried he, plunging into a thick bush behind him", ' The whale tugged at one end, and the elephant tugged at the other, and neither had any idea that he had not the tortoise for his foe  When the whale pulled hardest the elephant was dragged into the water; and when the elephant pulled the hardest the whale was hauled on to the land  They were very evenly matched, and the battle was a hard one  At last they were quite tired, and the tortoise, who was watching, saw that they could play no more', " So he crept from his hiding-place, and dipping himself in the river, he went to the elephant and said: 'I see that you really are stronger than I thought", " Suppose we give it up for to-day?' Then he dried himself on some moss and went to the whale and said: 'I see that you really are stronger than I thought" ,  ' During the whole of the week Irene had been thinking every other moment of her promise to the old lady, although even now she could not feel quite sure that she had not been dreaming  Could it really be that an old lady lived up in the top of the house, with pigeons and a spinning-wheel, and a lamp that never went out? She was, however, none the less determined, on the coming Friday, to ascend the three stairs, walk through the passages with the many doors, and try to find the tower in which she had either seen or dreamed her grandmother  Her nurse could not help wondering what had come to the child--she would sit so thoughtfully silent, and even in the midst of a game with her would so suddenly fall into a dreamy mood  But Irene took care to betray nothing, whatever efforts Lootie might make to get at her thoughts', " And Lootie had to say to herself: 'What an odd child she is!' and give it up", ' At length the longed-for Friday arrived, and lest Lootie should be moved to watch her, Irene endeavoured to keep herself as quiet as possible', " In the afternoon she asked for her doll's house, and went on arranging and rearranging the various rooms and their inhabitants for a whole hour", ' Then she gave a sigh and threw herself back in her chair  One of the dolls would not sit, and another would not stand, and they were all very tiresome  Indeed, there was one would not even lie down, which was too bad  But it was now getting dark, and the darker it got the more excited Irene became, and the more she felt it necessary to be composed', " 'I see you want your tea, princess,' said the nurse: 'I will go and get it", ' The room feels close: I will open the window a little', " The evening is mild: it won't hurt you", "' 'There's no fear of that, Lootie,' said Irene, wishing she had put off going for the tea till it was darker, when she might have made her attempt with every advantage", ' I fancy Lootie was longer in returning than she had intended; for when Irene, who had been lost in thought, looked up, she saw it was nearly dark, and at the same moment caught sight of a pair of eyes, bright with a green light, glowering at her through the open window  The next instant something leaped into the room', " It was like a cat, with legs as long as a horse's, Irene said, but its body no bigger and its legs no thicker than those of a cat", ' She was too frightened to cry out, but not too frightened to jump from her chair and run from the room  It is plain enough to every one of my readers what she ought to have done--and indeed, Irene thought of it herself; but when she came to the foot of the old stair, just outside the nursery door, she imagined the creature running up those long ascents after her, and pursuing her through the dark passages--which, after all, might lead to no tower! That thought was too much  Her heart failed her, and, turning from the stair, she rushed along to the hall, whence, finding the front door open, she darted into the court pursued--at least she thought so--by the creature  No one happening to see her, on she ran, unable to think for fear, and ready to run anywhere to elude the awful creature with the stilt-legs  Not daring to look behind her, she rushed straight out of the gate and up the mountain  It was foolish indeed--thus to run farther and farther from all who could help her, as if she had been seeking a fit spot for the goblin creature to eat her in his leisure; but that is the way fear serves us: it always sides with the thing we are afraid of  The princess was soon out of breath with running uphill; but she ran on, for she fancied the horrible creature just behind her, forgetting that, had it been after her such long legs as those must have overtaken her long ago  At last she could run no longer, and fell, unable even to scream, by the roadside, where she lay for some time half dead with terror  But finding nothing lay hold of her, and her breath beginning to come back, she ventured at length to get half up and peer anxiously about her  It was now so dark she could see nothing  Not a single star was out  She could not even tell in what direction the house lay, and between her and home she fancied the dreadful creature lying ready to pounce upon her In a large town there was an old woman who sat in the evening alone in her room thinking how she had lost first her husband, then both her children, then one by one all her relatives, and at length, that very day, her last friend, and now she was quite alone and desolate  She was very sad at heart, and heaviest of all her losses to her was that of her sons, and in her pain she blamed God for it  She was still sitting lost in thought, when all at once she heard the bells ringing for early prayer  She was surprised that she had thus in her sorrow watched through the whole night, and lighted her lantern and went to church  It was already lighted up when she arrived, but not as it usually was with wax candles, but with a dim light  It was also crowded already with people, and all the seats were filled, and when the old woman got to her usual place it also was not empty, but the whole bench was entirely full  And when she looked at the people, they were none other than her dead relatives who were sitting there in their old-fashioned garments, but with pale faces  They neither spoke nor sang, but a soft humming and whispering was heard all over the church  Then an aunt of hers stood up, stepped forward, and said to the poor old woman, look there beside the altar, and you will see your sons  The old woman looked there, and saw her two children, one hanging on the gallows, the other bound to the wheel  Then said the aunt, behold, so would it have been with them if they had lived, and if the good God had not taken them to himself when they were innocent children  The old woman went trembling home, and on her knees thanked God for having dealt with her more kindly than she had been able to understand, and on the third day she lay down and died   There was once a sorcerer who was standing in the midst of a great crowd of people performing his wonders  He had a cock brought in, which lifted a heavy beam and carried it as if it were light as a feather  But a girl was present who had just found a four-leaved clover, and had thus become so wise that no deception could stand out against her, and she saw that the beam was nothing but a straw  So she cried, you people, do you not see that it is a straw that the cock is carrying, and no beam  Immediately the enchantment vanished, and the people saw what it was, and drove the magician away in shame and disgrace  He, however, full of inward anger, said, I will soon revenge myself', " After some time the girl's wedding-day came, and she was decked out, and went in a great procession over the fields to the place where the church was", ' All at once she came to a stream which was very much swollen, and there was no bridge and no plank to cross it  Then the bride nimbly took her clothes up, and wanted to wade through it  And just as she was thus standing in the water, a man, and it was the sorcerer, cried mockingly close beside her, aha  Where are your eyes that you take that for water  Then her eyes were opened, and she saw that she was standing with her clothes lifted up in the middle of a field that was blue with the flowers of blue flax  Then all the people saw it likewise, and chased her away with ridicule and laughter   Where do you like best to feed your flocks, said a man to an old cowherd  Here, sir, where the grass is neither too rich nor too poor, or else it is no use  Why not, asked the man  Do you hear that melancholy cry from the meadow there, answered the cowherd, that is the bittern  He was once a cowherd, and so was the hoopoe also, I will tell you the story  The bittern pastured his flocks on rich green meadows where flowers grew in abundance, so his cows became wild and unmanageable  The hoopoe drove his cattle on to high barren hills, where the wind plays with the sand, and his cows became thin, and got no strength  When it was evening, and the cowherds wanted to drive their cows homewards, the bittern could not get his together again  They were too high-spirited, and ran away from him  He called, come, cows, come, but it was of no use  They took no notice of his calling  The hoopoe, however, could not even get his cows up on their legs, so faint and weak had they become  Up, up, up, screamed he, but it was in vain, they remained lying on the sand  That is the way when one has no moderation  And to this day, though they have no flocks now to watch, the bittern cries, come, cows, come, and the hoopoe, up, up, up   There was once on a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received  The king said to him, "You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me serve for them " Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest  When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch  "Do give me one night\'s lodging, and a little to eat and drink," said he to her, "or I shall starve " "Oho," she answered, "who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish " "What do you wish?" said the soldier  "That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow " The soldier consented, and next day labored with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening  "I see well enough," said the witch, "that you can do no more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small " The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more  "Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work  Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again " Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket  He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again  She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him  "No," said he, perceiving her evil intention, "I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground " The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away  The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him  He saw very well that he could not escape death  He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full  "This shall be my last pleasure," thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke  When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said, "Lord, what are your commands?" "What my commands are?" replied the soldier, quite astonished  "I must do everything you bid me," said the little man  "Good," said the soldier, "then in the first place help me out of this well " The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him  On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry  When he was above, he said to the little man, "Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge " In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully  Nor was it long before the little man re-appeared A soldier who is afraid of nothing, troubles himself about nothing  One of this kind had received his discharge, and as he had learnt no trade and could earn nothing, he traveled about and begged alms of kind people  He had an old rain-coat on his back, and a pair of riding-boots of buffalo-leather which were still left to him  One day he was walking he knew not where, straight out into the open country, and at length came to a forest  He did not know where he was, but saw sitting on the trunk of a tree, which had been cut down, a man who was well dressed and wore a green shooting-coat  The soldier shook hands with him, sat down on the grass by his side, and stretched out his legs  I see you have good boots on, which are well blacked, said he to the huntsman, but if you had to travel about as I have, they would not last long  Look at mine, they are of buffalo-leather, and have been worn for a long time, but in them I can go through thick and thin  After a while the soldier got up and said, I can stay no longer, hunger drives me onwards, but, brother brightboots, where does this road lead to', " I don't know that myself, answered the huntsman, I have lost my way in the forest", ' Then you are in the same plight as I, said the soldier  Birds of a feather flock together, let us remain together, and seek our way  The huntsman smiled a little, and they walked on further and further, until night fell  We do not get out of the forest, said the soldier, but there in the distance I see a light shining  There we might find something to eat  They found a stone house, knocked at the door, and an old woman opened it  We are looking for quarters for the night, said the soldier, and some lining for our stomachs, for mine is as empty as an old knapsack  You cannot stay here, answered the old woman  This is a robbers, house, and you would do wisely to get away before they come home, or you will be lost', " It won't be so bad as that, answered the soldier, I have not had a mouthful for two days, and whether I am murdered here or die of hunger in the forest is all the same to me", ' I shall come in  The huntsman would not follow, but the soldier drew him in with him by the sleeve  Come, my dear brother, we shall not come to an end so quickly as that  The old woman had pity on them and said, creep in here behind the stove, and if they leave anything, I will give it to you on the sly when they are asleep  Scarcely were they in the corner before twelve robbers came bursting in, seated themselves at the table which was already laid, and vehemently demanded some food  The old woman brought in some great dishes of roast meat, and the robbers enjoyed that thoroughly  When the soldier smelled the food, he said to the huntsman, I cannot hold out any longer, I shall seat myself at the table, and eat with them  You will bring us to destruction, said the huntsman, and held him back by the arm  But the soldier began to cough loudly  When the robbers heard that, they threw away their knives and forks, leapt up, and discovered the two who were behind the stove A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn-sacks to the mill indefatigably for many a long year  But his strength was going, and he was growing more and more unfit for work  Then his master began to consider how he might best save his keep  But the donkey, seeing that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out on the road to bremen  There, he thought, I can surely be a town-musician  When he had walked some distance, he found a hound lying on the road, gasping like one who had run till he was tired  What are you gasping so for, you big fellow, asked the donkey  Ah, replied the hound, as I am old, and daily grow weaker, and no longer can hunt, my master wanted to kill me, so I took to flight, but now how am I to earn my bread  I tell you what, said the donkey, I am going to bremen, and shall be town-musician there  Go with me and engage yourself also as a musician  I will play the lute, and you shall beat the kettle-drum  The hound agreed, and on they went  Before long they came to a cat, sitting on the path, with a face like three rainy days  Now then, old shaver, what has gone askew with you, asked the donkey  Who can be merry when his neck is in danger, answered the cat  Because I am now getting old, and my teeth are worn to stumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about after mice, my mistress wanted to drown me, so I ran away  But now good advice is scarce  Where am I to go  Go with us to bremen  You understand night-music, you can be a town-musician  The cat thought well of it, and went with them  After this the three fugitives came to a farm-yard, where the cock was sitting upon the gate, crowing with all his might  Your crow goes through and through one, said the donkey  What is the matter', " I have been foretelling fine weather, because it is the day on which our lady washes the christ-child's little shirts, and wants to dry them, said the cock", ' But guests are coming for sunday, so the housewife has no pity, and has told the cook that she intends to eat me in the soup to-morrow, and this evening I am to have my head cut off  Now I am crowing at the top of my lungs while still I can  Ah, but red-comb, said the donkey, you had better come away with us  We are going to bremen  You can find something better than death everywhere' ,  "A tailor's apprentice was traveling about the world in search of work, and at one time he could find none, and his poverty was so great that he had not a farthing to live on", ' Presently he met a Jew on the road, and as he thought he would have a great deal of money about him, the tailor thrust God out of his heart, fell on the Jew, and said, give me your money, or I will strike you dead  Then said the Jew, grant me my life, I have no money but eight farthings  But the tailor said, money you have, and it shall be produced, and used violence and beat him until he was near death  And when the Jew was dying, the last words he said were, the bright sun will bring it to light, and thereupon he died', " The tailor's apprentice felt in his pockets and sought for money, but he found nothing but eight farthings, as the Jew had said", ' Then he took him up and carried him behind a clump of trees, and went onwards to seek work  After he had traveled about a long while, he found work in a town with a master who had a pretty daughter, with whom he fell in love, and he married her, and lived in good and happy wedlock', " After a long time when he and his wife had two children, the wife's father and mother died, and the young people kept house alone", ' One morning, when the husband was sitting on the table before the window, his wife brought him his coffee, and when he had poured it out into the saucer, and was just going to drink, the sun shone on it and the reflection gleamed hither and thither on the wall above, and made circles on it  Then the tailor looked up and said, yes, it would like very much to bring it to light, and cannot  The woman said, o, dear husband, and what is that, then  What do you mean by that  He answered, I must not tell you  But she said, if you love me, you must tell me, and used her most affectionate words, and said that no one should ever know it, and left him no rest  Then he told her how years ago, when he was traveling about seeking work and quite worn out and penniless, he had killed a Jew, and that in the last agonies of death, the Jew had spoken the words, the bright sun will bring it to light  And now, the sun had just wanted to bring it to light, and had gleamed and made circles on the wall, but had not been able to do it  After this, he again charged her particularly never to tell this, or he would lose his life, and she did promise  However, when he had sat down to work again, she went to her great friend and confided the story to her, and asked her never to repeat it to any human being, but before three days were over, the whole town knew it, and the tailor was brought to trial, and condemned  And thus, after all, the bright sun did bring it to light   George one day said to his little chickens, come into the parlor and enjoy yourselves, and pick up the bread-crumbs on the table  Your mistress has gone out to pay some visits  Then the chickens said, no, no, we will not go  If the mistress gets to know it, she will beat us  George said, she will know nothing about it  So come  After all, she never gives you anything good  Then the chickens again said, nay, nay, we must let it alone  We must not go  But george let them have no peace until at last they went, and got on the table, and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might  But at that very moment the mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and beat them and treated them very harshly  And when they were outside the house, the chickens said to george, do, do, do, do, do, you see', " Then george laughed and said, didn't, didn't, didn't, I expect it", ' So they just had to run away   There was once an enchantress, who had three sons who loved each other as brothers, but the old woman did not trust them, and thought they wanted to steal her power from her  So she changed the eldest into an eagle, which was forced to dwell in the rocky mountains, and was often seen flying in great circles in the sky  The second, she changed into a whale, which lived in the deep sea, and all that was seen of it was that it sometimes spouted up a great jet of water in the air  Each of them bore his human form for only two hours daily  The third son, who was afraid she might change him into a raging wild beast - a bear perhaps, or a wolf, went secretly away', " He had heard that a king's daughter who was bewitched, was imprisoned in the castle of the golden sun, and was waiting to be set free", ' Those, however, who tried to free her risked their lives  Three-and-twenty youths had already died a miserable death, and now only one other might make the attempt, after which no more must come  And as his heart was without fear, he made up his mind to seek out the castle of the golden sun  He had already traveled about for a long time without being able to find it, when he came by chance into a great forest, and did not know the way out of it  All at once he saw in the distance two giants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came to them they said, we are quarreling about a cap, and which of us it is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us can get the better of the other  The small men are cleverer than we are, so we will leave the decision to you  How can you dispute about an old cap, said the youth  You do not know what properties it has  It is a wishing-cap, whosoever puts it on, can wish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be there  Give me the cap, said the youth, I will go a short distance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the cap shall belong to the one who gets first to me', " He put it on and went away, and thought of the king's daughter, forgot the giants, and walked continually onward", ' At length he sighed from the very bottom of his heart, and cried, ah, if I were but at the castle of the golden sun  And hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain before the gate of the castle', " He entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he found the king's daughter", ' But how shocked he was when he saw her  She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, bleary eyes, and red hair', " Are you the king's daughter, whose beauty the whole world praises, cried he", ' Ah, she answered, this is not my form, human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that you may know what I am like, look in the mirror - it does not let itself be misled - it will show you my image as it is in truth  She gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how the tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief  Then said he, how can you be set free  I fear no danger  She said, he who gets the crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy his power with it, and I shall resume my true shape  Ah, she added, so many have already gone to meet death for this, and you are so young, I grieve that you should encounter such great danger  Nothing can keep me from doing it, said he, but tell me what I must do There was once upon a time a princess who was extremely proud  If a wooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not guess it, he was sent contemptuously away  She let it be made known also that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be who he might  At length, three tailors fell in with each other, the two eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous jobs of work successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also, the third was a little, useless harum-scarum, who did not even know his trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for where else was it to come from  Then the two others said to him, just stay at home, you cannot do much with your little understanding  The little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and said he had set his mind to work on this for once, and he would manage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his  They all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was to propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now come, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a needle  Then said the princess, "I have two kinds of hair on my head, of what color is it " "If that be all," said the first, "it must be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and salt " The princess said, "Wrongly guessed, let the second answer " Then said the second, "If it be not black and white, then it is brown and red, like my father\'s sunday coat " "Wrongly guessed," said the princess, "let the third give the answer for I see very well he knows it for certain " Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and said, "The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two different colors " When the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down with terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she had firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it  When her courage returned she said, "You have not won me yet by that  There is still something else that you must do  Below, in the stable is a bear with which you shall pass the night, and when I get up in the morning if you are still alive, you shall marry me " She expected, however, she would thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never yet left anyone alive who had fallen into his clutches  The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite delighted, and said, "Boldly ventured is half won " So when the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the bear  The bear was about to set on the little fellow at once, and give him a hearty welcome with his paws  "Softly, softly," said the little tailor, "I will soon make you quiet " Then quite composedly, and as if he had no anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of his pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels  When the bear saw that, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too  The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful, they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles  The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would  "Eh," thought he, "what a stupid blockhead am I, I cannot even crack a nut " And then he said to the tailor, "Here, crack me the nuts " "There, see what a stupid fellow you are," said the little tailor, "to have such a great mouth, and not be able to crack a small nut " Then he took the pebble and nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it was in two Once upon a time the little hen went with the little cock to the nut-hill, and they agreed together that whichsoever of them found a kernel of a nut should share it with the other  Then the hen found a large, large nut, but said nothing about it, intending to eat the kernel herself  The kernel, however, was so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained sticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should be choked  Then she cried, cock, I entreat you to run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I shall choke  The little cock did run as fast as he could to the spring, and said, stream, you are to give me some water, the little hen is lying on the nut-hill, and she has swallowed a large nut, and is choking  The well answered, first run to the bride, and get her to give you some red silk  The little cock ran to the bride and said, bride, you are to give me some red silk, I want to give red silk to the well, the well is to give me some water, I am to take the water to the little hen who is lying on the nut-hill and has swallowed a great nut-kernel, and is choking with it  The bride answered, first run and bring me my little wreath which is hanging to a willow  So the little cock ran to the willow, and drew the wreath from the branch and took it to the bride, and the bride gave him some red silk for it, which he took to the well, who gave him some water for it  Then the little cock took the water to the hen, but when he got there the hen had choked in the meantime, and lay there dead and did not move  Then the cock was so distressed that he cried aloud, and every animal came to lament the little hen, and six mice built a little carriage to carry her to her grave, and when the carriage was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove  On the way, however, they met the fox, who said, where are you going, little cock  I am going to bury my little hen  May I drive with you  Yes, but seat yourself at the back of the carriage, for in the front my little horses could not drag you  Then the procession went onwards, and they reached a stream  How are we to cross over, said the little cock  A straw was lying by the stream and it said, I will lay myself straight across, and then you can drive over me  But when the six mice came to the bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned  Then they were again in difficulty, and a coal came and said, I am large enough, I will lay myself across, and you shall drive over me  So the coal also laid itself across the water, but unhappily just touched it, at which the coal hissed, was extinguished and died  When a stone saw that, it took pity on the little cock, wished to help him, and laid itself over the water  Then the cock drew the carriage himself, but when he got it over and reached the shore with the dead hen, and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well, there were too many of them, the carriage ran back, and they all fell into the water together, and were drowned  Then the little cock was left alone with the dead hen, and dug a grave for her and laid her in it, and made a mound above it, on which he sat down and fretted until he died too, and then everyone was dead   There was a great war, and the king had many soldiers, but gave them small pay, so small that they could not live upon it, so three of them agreed among themselves to desert  One of them said to the others, "If we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows, how shall we manage it?" Another said, "Look at that great cornfield, if we were to hide ourselves there, no one could find us, the troops are not allowed to enter it, and to-morrow they are to march away " They crept into the corn, only the troops did not march away, but remained lying all round about it  They stayed in the corn for two days and two nights, and were so hungry that they all but died, but if they had come out, their death would have been certain  Then said they, "What is the use of our deserting if we have to perish miserably here?" But now a fiery dragon came flying through the air, and it came down to them, and asked why they had concealed themselves there  They answered, "We are three soldiers who have deserted because the pay was so bad, and now we shall have to die of hunger if we stay here, or to dangle on the gallows if we go out " "If you will serve me for seven years," said the dragon, "I will convey you through the army so that no one shall seize you " "We have no choice and are compelled to accept," they replied  Then the dragon caught hold of them with his claws, and carried them away through the air over the army, and put them down again on the earth far from it, but the dragon was no other than the devil  He gave them a small whip and said, "Whip with it and crack it, and then as much gold will spring up round about as you can wish for, then you can live like great lords, keep horses, and drive your carriages, but when the seven years have come to an end, you are my property " Then he put before them a book which they were all three forced to sign  "But first I will ask you a riddle," said he, "and if you can guess it, you shall be free, and released from my power " Then the dragon flew away from them, and they went away with their whip, had gold in plenty, ordered themselves rich apparel, and traveled about the world  Wherever they were they lived in pleasure and magnificence, rode on horseback, drove in carriages, ate and drank, but did nothing wicked  The time slipped quickly by, and when the seven years were coming to an end, two of them were terribly anxious and alarmed, but the third took the affair easily, and said, "Brothers, fear nothing, I still have my wits about me, I shall guess the riddle " They went out into the open country and sat down, and the two pulled sorrowful faces  Then an aged woman came up to them who inquired why they were so sad  "Well," said they, "what has that got to do with you? After all, you cannot help us " "Who knows?" said she  "Just confide your trouble to me " So they told her that they had been the devil\'s servants for nearly seven years, and that he had provided them with gold as though it were hay, but that they had sold themselves to him, and were forfeited to him, if at the end of the seven years they could not guess a riddle  The old woman said, "If you are to be saved, one of you must go into the forest, there he will come to a fallen rock which looks like a little house, he must enter that, and then he will obtain help " The two melancholy ones thought to themselves, "That will still not save us," and stayed where they were, but the third, the merry one, got up and walked on in the forest until he found the rockhouse', " In the little house a very aged woman was sitting, who was the devil's grandmother, and asked the soldier where he came from, and what he wanted there", ' He told her everything that had happened, and as he pleased her well, she had pity on him, and said she would help him  She lifted up a great stone which lay above a cellar, and said, "Conceal yourself there, you can hear everything that is said here, only sit still, and do not stir  When the dragon comes, I will question him about the riddle, he tells everything to me, so listen carefully to his answer " At twelve o\'clock at night, the dragon came flying thither, and asked for his dinner  The grandmother laid the table, and served up food and drink, so that he was pleased, and they ate and drank together  In the course of conversation, she asked him what kind of a day he had had, and how many souls he had got' ,  "There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son, and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the king's daughter for his wife", ' It happened that soon afterwards the king came into the village, and no one knew that he was the king, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, a child has just been born with a caul on, whatever anyone so born undertakes turns out well', " It is prophesied, too, that in his fourteenth year he will have the king's daughter for his wife", ' The king, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, you poor people, let me have your child, and I will take care of it  At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought, it is a child of good fortune, and everything must turn out well for it, they at last consented, and gave him the child  The king put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water, then he threw the box into it and thought, I have freed my daughter from her undesired suitor  The box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it', " And it floated to within two miles of the king's chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a halt at the mill-dam", " A miller's boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively", ' He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said, "God has given him to us " They took great care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness  It happened that once in a storm, the king went into the mill, and asked the mill-folk if the tall youth were their son', " No, answered they, he's a foundling", ' Fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water  Then the king knew that it was none other than the child of good fortune which he had thrown into the water, and he said, my good people, could not the youth take a letter to the queen  I will give him two gold pieces as a reward  Just as the king commands, answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness  Then the king wrote a letter to the queen, wherein he said, as soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be killed and buried, and all must be done before I come home  The boy set out with this letter, but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest  In the darkness he saw a small light, he went towards it and reached a cottage  When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone  She started when she saw the boy, and said, whence do you come, and whither are you going  I come from the mill, he answered, and wish to go to the queen, to whom I am taking a letter, but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night  You poor boy, said the woman, you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you  Let them come, said the boy, I am not afraid, but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther  And he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep  Soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there  Ah, said the old woman, it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in, he has to take a letter to the queen  The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death', " Then the hardhearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the king's daughter" ,  'A discharged soldier had nothing to live on, and did not know how to make his way  So he went out into the forest and when he had walked for a short time, he met a little man who turned out to be the devil  The little man said to him, "What ails you, you seem so very sorrowful?" Then the soldier said, "I am hungry, but have no money " The devil said, "If you will hire yourself to me, and be my serving-man, you shall have enough for all your life  You shall serve me for seven years, and after that you shall again be free  But one thing I must tell you, and that is, you must not wash, comb, or trim yourself, or cut your hair or nails, or wipe the water from your eyes " The soldier said, "All right, if there is no help for it," and went off with the little man, who straightway led him down into hell  Then he told him what he had to do  He was to poke the fire under the kettles wherein the hell-broth was stewing, keep the house clean, drive all the sweepings behind the doors, and see that everything was in order, but if he once peeped into the kettles, it would go ill with him  The soldier said, "Good, I will take care " And then the old devil went out again on his wanderings, and the soldier entered upon his new duties, made the fire, and swept the dirt well behind the doors, just as he had been bidden  When the old devil came back again, he looked to see if all had been done, appeared satisfied, and went forth a second time  The soldier now took a good look on every side, the kettles were standing all round hell with a mighty fire below them, and inside they were boiling and sputtering  He would have given anything to look inside them, if the devil had not so particularly forbidden him  At last he could no longer restrain himself, slightly raised the lid of the first kettle, and peeped in, and there he saw his former corporal sitting  "Aha, old bird," said he, "do I meet you here? You once had me in your power, now I have you " And he quickly let the lid fall, poked the fire, and added a fresh log  After that, he went to the second kettle, raised its lid also a little, and peeped in and there sat his former ensign  "Aha, old bird, so I find you here, you once had me in your power, now I have you " He closed the lid again, and fetched yet another log to make it really hot  Then he wanted to see who might be sitting up in the third kettle - and who should it be but his general  "Aha, old bird, do I meet you here  Once you had me in your power, now I have you " And he fetched the bellows and made hell-fire blaze right under him  So he did his work seven years in hell, did not wash, comb, or trim himself, or cut his hair or nails, or wash the water out of his eyes, and the seven years seemed so short to him that he thought he had only been half a year  Now when the time had fully gone by, the devil came and said, "Well Hans, what have you done?" "I poked the fire under the kettles, and I have swept all the dirt well behind the doors " "But you have peeped into the kettles as well, it is lucky for you that you added fresh logs to them, or else your life would have been forfeited  Now that your time is up, will you go home again?" "Yes," said the soldier, "I should very much like to see what my father is doing at home " The devil said, "In order that you may receive the wages you have earned, go and fill your knapsack full of the sweepings, and take it home with you', " You must also go unwashed and uncombed, with long hair on your head and beard, and with uncut nails and dim eyes, and when you are asked whence you come, you must say, from hell, and when you are asked who you are, you are to say, the devil's sooty brother, and my king as well" ,  'I will tell you something  I saw two roasted fowls flying, they flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and their backs to hell, and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across the rhine prettily, slowly, and gently, and a frog sat on the ice at whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare  Three fellows who wanted to catch a hare, went on crutches and stilts, one of them was deaf, the second blind, the third dumb, and the fourth could not stir a step  Do you want to know how it was done  First, the blind man saw the hare running across the field, the dumb one called to the lame one, and the lame one seized it by the neck  There were certain men who wished to sail on dry land, and they set their sails in the wind, and sailed away over great fields  Then they sailed over a high mountain, and there they were miserably drowned  A crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed, and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there  In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here  Open the window that the lies may fly out   A sheep-dog had not a good master, but, on the contrary, one who let him suffer hunger  As he could stay no longer with him, he went quite sadly away  On the road he met a sparrow who said, brother dog, why are you so sad  The dog replied, I am hungry, and have nothing to eat  Then said the sparrow, dear brother, come into the town with me, and I will satisy your hunger', " So they went into the town together, and when they came in front of a butcher's shop the sparrow said to the dog, stay there, and I will pick a bit of meat down for you, and he alighted on the stall, looked about him to see that no one was observing him, and pecked and pulled and tore so long at a piece which lay on the edge, that it slipped down", ' Then the dog seized it, ran into a corner, and devoured it  The sparrow said, now come with me to another shop, and then I will get you one more piece that you may be satisfied  When the dog had devoured the second piece as well, the sparrow asked, brother dog, have you now had enough  Yes, I have had meat enough, he answered, but I have had no bread yet  Said the sparrow, you shall have that also, come with me', " Then he took him to a baker's shop, and pecked at a couple of little buns till they rolled down, and as the dog wanted still more, he led him to another stall, and again got bread for him", ' When that was consumed, the sparrow said, brother dog, have you now had enough  Yes, he replied, now we will walk awhile outside the town  Then they both went out on to the highway  The weather was warm, however, and when they had walked a little way the dog said, I am tired, and would like to sleep  Well, do sleep, answered the sparrow, and in the meantime I will seat myself on a branch  So the dog lay down on the road, and fell fast asleep  Whilst he lay sleeping there, a waggoner came driving by, who had a cart with three horses, laden with two barrels of wine', " The sparrow, however, saw that he was not going to turn aside, but was staying in the wheel track in which the dog was lying, so it cried, waggoner, don't do it, or I will make you poor", ' But the waggoner growled to himself, you will not make me poor, and cracked his whip and drove the cart over the dog, and the wheels killed him  Then the sparrow cried, you have run over my brother dog and killed him, it shall cost you your cart and horses  Cart and horses indeed, said the waggoner  What harm can you do me  And drove onwards  Then the sparrow crept under the cover of the cart, and pecked so long at the same bung-hole that he got the bung out, and then all the wine ran out without the driver noticing it  But once when he was looking behind him he saw that the cart was dripping, and looked at the barrels and saw that one of them was empty  Unfortunate fellow that am I, cried he  Not unfortunate enough yet, said the sparrow, and flew on to the head of one of the horses and pecked his eyes out  When the driver saw that, he drew out his axe and wanted to hit the sparrow, but the sparrow flew into the air, and he hit his horse on the head and it fell down dead Once upon a time there lived a king and a queen, who were rich, and had everything they wanted, but no children  The queen lamented over this day and night, and said, I am like a field on which nothing grows  At last God gave her her wish, but when the child came into the world, it did not look like a human child, but was a little donkey  When the mother saw that, her lamentations and outcries began in real earnest  She said she would far rather have had no child at all than have a donkey, and that they were to throw it into the water that the fishes might devour it  But the king said, no, since God has sent him he shall be my son and heir, and after my death sit on the royal throne, and wear the kingly crown  The donkey, therefore, was brought up and grew bigger, and his ears grew up high and straight  And he was of a merry disposition, jumped about, played and took especial pleasure in music, so that he went to a celebrated musician and said, teach me your art, that I may play the lute as well as you do  Ah, dear little master, answered the musician, that would come very hard to you, your fingers are not quite suited to it, and are far too big  I am afraid the strings would not last  But no excuses were of any use  The donkey was determined to play the lute  And since he was persevering and industrious, he at last learnt to do it as well as the master himself  The young lordling once went out walking full of thought and came to a well', " He looked into it and in the mirror-clear water saw his donkey's form", ' He was so distressed about it, that he went out into the wide world and only took with him one faithful companion  They traveled up and down, and at last they came into a kingdom where and old king reigned who had a single but wonderfully beautiful daughter  The donkey said, here we will stay, knocked at the gate, and cried, a guest is without  Open, that he may enter  When the gate was not opened, he sat down, took his lute and played it in the most delightful manner with his two fore-feet  Then the door-keeper opened his eyes, and gaped, and ran to the king and said, outside by the gate sits a young donkey which plays the lute as well as an experienced master  Then let the musician come to me, said the king  But when a donkey came in, everyone began to laugh at the lute-player  And when the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants, he was unwilling, and said, I am no common stable-ass, I am a noble one  Then they said, if that is what you are, seat yourself with the soldiers  No, said he, I will sit by the king  The king smiled, and said good-humoredly, yes, it shall be as you will, little ass, come here to me  Then he asked, little ass, how does my daughter please you  The donkey turned his head towards her, looked at her, nodded and said, I like her above measure, I have never yet seen anyone so beautiful as she is  Well, then, you shall sit next her too, said the king A young drummer went out quite alone one evening into the country, and came to a lake on the shore of which he perceived lying there three pieces of white linen  What fine linen, said he, and put one piece in his pocket  He returned home, thought no more of what he had found, and went to bed  Just as he was going to sleep, it seemed to him as if someone was calling his name  He listened, and was aware of a soft voice which cried to him, drummer, drummer, wake up  As it was a dark night he could see no one, but it appeared to him that a figure was hovering about his bed  What do you want, he asked  Give me back my shift, answered the voice, that you took away from me last evening by the lake  You shall have it back again, said the drummer, if you will tell me who you are  Ah, replied the voice, I am the daughter of a mighty king  But I have fallen into the power of a witch, and am shut up on the glass-mountain  I have to bathe in the lake every day with my two sisters, but I cannot fly back again without my shift  My sisters have gone away, but I have been forced to stay behind  I entreat you to give me my shift back', " Don't worry, poor child, said the drummer", ' I will willingly give it back to you  He took it out of his pocket, and reached it to her in the dark  She snatched it in haste, and wanted to go away with it  Stop a moment, perhaps I can help you  You can only help me by ascending the glass-mountain, and indeed if you were quite close to it you could not ascend it  When I want to do a thing I always can do it, said the drummer  I am sorry for you, and have no fear of anything  But I do not know the way which leads to the glass-mountain  The road goes through the great forest, in which the man-eaters live, she answered, and more than that, I dare not tell you  And then he heard her wings as she flew away  By daybreak the drummer arose, buckled on his drums, and went without fear straight into the forest  After he had walked for a while without seeing any giants, he thought to himself, I must waken up the sluggards, and he hung his drum before him, and beat such a roll that the birds flew out of the trees with loud cries  It was not long before a giant who had been lying sleeping among the grass, rose up, and was as tall as a fir-tree  Wretch, cried he, what are you drumming here for, and wakening me out of my best sleep  I am drumming, he replied, because I want to show the way to many thousands who are following me' ,  "When God created the world and was about to fix the length of each creature's life, the ass came and asked, Lord, how long shall I live", ' Thirty years, replied God, does that content you  Ah, Lord, answered the ass, that is a long time  Think of my painful existence  To carry heavy burdens from morning to night, to drag sacks of corn to the mill that others may eat bread, to be cheered and refreshed with nothing but blows and kicks  Relieve me of a portion of this long time  Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years  The ass went away comforted, and the dog appeared  How long would you like to live, said God to him, thirty years are too many for the ass, but you will be satisfied with that  Lord, answered the dog, is that thy will  Consider how I shall have to run, my feet will never hold out so long, and when I have once lost my voice for barking, and my teeth for biting, what will be left for me to do but run from one corner to another and growl  God saw that he was right, and released him from twelve years of life  Then came the monkey  You will certainly live thirty years willingly, said the Lord to him, you have no need to work as the ass and the dog have to, and will always enjoy yourself  Ah, Lord, he answered, it may seem as if that were the case, but it is quite different  When it rains millet-porridge I have no spoon  I am always to play merry pranks, and make faces which force people to laugh, and if they give me an apple, and I bite into it, why, it is sour  How often sadness hides itself behind mirth  I shall never be able to hold out for thirty years  God was gracious and took off ten  At last man appeared, joyous, healthy and vigorous, and begged God to appoint his time for him  Thirty years shall you live, said the Lord  Is that enough for you  What a short time, cried man, when I have built my house and my fire burns on my own hearth, when I have planted trees which blossom and bear fruit, and am just intending to enjoy my life, I am to die  O Lord, lengthen my time', " I will add to it the ass's eighteen years, said God", ' That is not enough, replied the man', " You shall also have the dog's twelve years", ' Still too little', " Well, then, said God, I will give you the monkey's ten years also, but more you shall not have" ,  'In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now  Then the ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five hundred-fold  Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top of the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the length of the ear  Men however are so made, that when they are too well off they no longer value the blessings which come from God, but grow indifferent and careless  One day a woman was passing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running beside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock  On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and cleaned the frock with them  When the Lord, who just then came by, saw that, he was angry, and said, henceforth shall the stalks of corn bear no more ears, men are no longer worthy of heavenly gifts  The by-standers who heard this, were terrified, and fell on their knees and prayed that he would still leave something on the stalks, even if the people were undeserving of it, for the sake of the innocent chickens which would otherwise have to starve  The Lord, who foresaw their suffering, had pity on them, and granted the request  So the ears were left as they now grow   A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he had nothing left but leather for one pair of shoes  So in the evening, he cut out the shoes which he wished to begin to make the next morning, and as he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly in his bed, commended himself to God, and fell asleep  In the morning, after he had said his prayers, and was just going to sit down to work, the two shoes stood quite finished on his table  He was astounded, and knew not what to think  He took the shoes in his hands to observe them closer, and they were so neatly made, with not one bad stitch in them, that it was just as if they were intended as a masterpiece  Before long, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him so well, he paid more for them than was customary, and, with the money, the shoemaker was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes  He cut them out at night, and next morning was about to set to work with fresh courage, but he had no need to do so for, when he got up, they were already made, and buyers also were not wanting, who gave him money enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes  Again the following morning he found the pairs made, and so it went on constantly, what he cut out in the evening was finished by the morning, so that he soon had his honest independence again, and at last became a wealthy man  Now it befell that one evening not long before christmas, when the man had been cutting out, he said to his wife, before going to bed, what think you if we were to stay up to-night to see who it is that lends us this helping hand  The woman liked the idea, and lighted a candle, and then they hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind some clothes which were hanging up there, and watched', " When it was midnight, two pretty little naked men came, sat down by the shoemaker's table, took all the work which was cut out before them and began to stitch, and sew, and hammer so skilfully and so quickly with their little fingers that the shoemaker could not avert his eyes for astonishment", ' They did not stop until all was done, and stood finished on the table, and they ran quickly away  Next morning the woman said, the little men have made us rich, and we really must show that we are grateful for it  They run about so, and have nothing on, and must be cold', " I'll tell you what I'll do, I will make them little shirts, and coats, and vests, and trousers, and knit both of them a pair of stockings, and you make them two little pairs of shoes", ' The man said, I shall be very glad to do it  And one night, when everything was ready, they laid their presents all together on the table instead of the cut-out work, and then concealed themselves to see how the little men would behave  At midnight they came bounding in, and wanted to get to work at once, but as they did not find any leather cut out, but only the pretty little articles of clothing, they were at first astonished, and then they showed intense delight  They dressed themselves with the greatest rapidity, put on the beautiful clothes, and sang,   now we are boys so fine to see,   why should we longer cobblers be  Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches  At last they danced out of doors  From that time forth they came no more, but as long as the shoemaker lived all went well with him, and all his efforts prospered   There was once upon a time a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pig-stye close by the sea, and every day he went out fishing  And he fished, and he fished  And once he was sitting with his rod, looking at the clear water, and he sat and he sat  Then his line suddenly went down, far down below, and when he drew it up again, he brought out a large flounder  Then the flounder said to him, hark, you fisherman, I pray you, let me live, I am no flounder really, but an enchanted prince  What good will it do you to kill me  I should not be good to eat, put me in the water again, and let me go  Come, said the fisherman, there is no need for so many words about it - a fish that can talk I should certainly let go, anyhow  And with that he put him back again into the clear water, and the flounder went to the bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him  Then the fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the pig-stye  Husband, said the woman, have you caught nothing to-day  No, said the man, I did catch a flounder, who said he was an enchanted prince, so I let him go again  Did you not wish for anything first, said the woman  No, said the man, what should I wish for  Ah, said the woman, it is surely hard to have to live always in this pig-stye which stinks and is so disgusting  You might have wished for a little hut for us  Go back and call him  Tell him we want to have a little hut, he will certainly give us that  Ah, said the man, why should I go there again  Why, said the woman, you did catch him, and you let him go again  He is sure to do it  Go at once  The man still did not quite like to go, but did not like to oppose his wife either, and went to the sea  When he got there the sea was all green and yellow, and no longer so smooth, so he stood still and said,      flounder, flounder in the sea,      come, I pray thee, here to me', "      For my wife, good ilsabil,      wills not as I'd have her will", ' Then the flounder came swimming to him and said, well what does she want, then  Ah, said the man, I did catch you, and my wife says I really ought to have wished for something  She does not like to live in a pig-stye any longer  She would like to have a hut  Go, then, said the flounder, she has it already A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen  When he got to the field, both the animals, horns began to grow, and went on growing, and when he wanted to go home they were so big that the oxen could not get through the gateway  By good luck a butcher came by just then, and he delivered them over to him, and made the bargain in this way, that he should bring the butcher a peck of rape-seed, and then the butcher was to count him out a brabant taler for every seed  I call that well sold  The peasant now went home, and carried the peck of rape-seed to him on his back  On the way, however, he lost one seed out of the bag  The butcher paid him justly as agreed on, and if the peasant had not lost the seed, he would have had one taler more  By the time he returned, the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to the sky  Then thought the peasant, as you have the chance, you must just see what the angels are doing up there above  So he climbed up, and saw that the angels above were threshing oats, and he looked on  While he was thus watching them, he observed that the tree on which he was standing, was beginning to totter  He peeped down, and saw that someone was just going to cut it down  If I were to fall down from hence it would be a bad thing, thought he, and in his extremity he did not know how to save himself better than by taking the chaff of the oats which lay there in heaps, and twisting a rope of it  He likewise snatched a hoe and a flail which were lying about in heaven, and let himself down by the rope  But he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep, deep hole  So it was a real stroke of luck that he had brought the hoe, for he hoed himself a flight of steps with it, and mounted up, and took the flail with him as a token of his truth, so that no one could have any doubt of his story   There was once a poor man who had four sons, and when they were grown up, he said to them, "My dear children, you must now go out into the world, for I have nothing to give you, so set out, go abroad and learn a trade, and see how you can make your way " So the four brothers took their sticks, bade their father farewell, and went through the town-gate together  When they had traveled about for some time, they came to a crossroads which branched off in four different directions  Then said the eldest, "Here we must separate, but on this day four years hence, we will meet each other again at this spot, and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes " Then each of them went his way, and the eldest met a man who asked him where he was going, and what he was intending to do  "I want to learn a trade," he replied  Then the other said, "Come with me," and be a thief  "No," he answered, "that is no longer regarded as a reputable trade, and the end of it is that one has to swing on the gallows " "Oh," said the man, "you need not be afraid of the gallows, I will only teach you to get such things as no other man could ever lay hold of, and no one will ever detect you " So he allowed himself to be talked into it, and while with the man became an accomplished thief, and so dexterous that nothing was safe from him, if he once desired to have it  The second brother met a man who put the same question to him - what he wanted to learn in the world  "I don\'t know yet," he replied  "Then come with me, and be an astronomer, there is nothing better than that, for nothing is hid from you " He liked the idea, and became such a skillful astronomer that when he had learnt everything, and was about to travel onwards, his master gave him a telescope and said to him, "With that you can see whatsoever takes place either on earth or in heaven, and nothing can remain concealed from you " A huntsman took the third brother into training, and gave him such excellent instruction in everything which related to huntsmanship that he became an experienced hunter  When he went away, his master gave him a gun and said, "It will never fail you, whatsoever you aim at, you are certain to hit " The youngest brother also met a man who spoke to him, and inquired what his intentions were  "Would you not like to be a tailor?" said he  "Not that I know of," said the youth, "sitting doubled up from morning till night, driving the needle and the goose backwards and forwards, is not to my taste " "Oh, but you are speaking in ignorance," answered the man  "With me you would learn a very different kind of tailoring, which is respectable and proper, and for the most part very honorable " So he let himself be persuaded, and went with the man, and learnt his art from the very beginning  When they parted, the man gave the youth a needle, and said, "With this you can sew together whatever is given you, whether it is as soft as an egg or as hard as steel, and it will all become one piece of stuff, so that no seam will be visible " When the appointed four years were over, the four brothers arrived at the same time at the cross-roads, embraced and kissed each other, and returned home to their father  "So now," said he, quite delighted, "the wind has blown you back again to me " They told him of all that had happened to them, and that each had learnt his own trade  Now they were sitting just in front of the house under a large tree, and the father said, "I will put you all to the test, and see what you can do " Then he looked up and said to his second son, "Between two branches up at the top of this tree, there is a chaffinch\'s nest, tell me how many eggs there are in it " The astronomer took his glass, looked up and said, "There are five " Then the father said to the eldest, "Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself, he is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world, she spoke to him in a friendly way  Good-day, dear mr  Fox, how are you  How is all with you  How are you getting on in these hard times  The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not  At last he said, oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of  Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on  What have you learnt  How many arts do you understand  I understand but one, replied the cat, modestly  What art is that, asked the fox  When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself  Is that all, said the fox  I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning  You make me sorry for you  Come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the hounds  Just then came a hunter with four dogs  The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down on top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her  Open your sack, mr  Fox, open your sack, cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast  Ah, mr  Fox, cried the cat  You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch  Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life   The fox once came to a meadow in which sat a flock of fine fat geese, on which he smiled and said, I come in the nick of time, you are sitting together quite beautifully, so that I can eat you up one after the other  The geese cackled with terror, sprang up, and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives  But the fox would listen to nothing, and said, there is no mercy to be had  You must die  At length one of them took heart and said, if we poor geese are to yield up our lives, show us the only possible favor and allow us one more prayer, that we may not die in our sins, and then we will place ourselves in a row, so that you can always pick yourself out the fattest  Yes, said the fox, that is reasonable, and a pious request  Pray away, I will wait till you are done  Then the first began a good long prayer, for ever saying, ga, ga, and as she would make no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but began also, ga, ga  The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were all cackling together  When they have done praying, the story shall be continued further, but at present they are still praying unceasingly   A peasant had a faithful horse which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master would no longer give him anything to eat and said, I can certainly make no more use of you, but still I mean well by you, if you prove yourself still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will maintain you, but now take yourself away out of my stable  And with that he chased him into the open country  The horse was sad, and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather  Then the fox met him and said, why do you hang your head so, and go about all alone  Alas, replied the horse, avarice and fidelity do not dwell together in one house  My master has forgotten what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plough well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out  Without giving you a chance, asked the fox  The chance was a bad one  He said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he well knows that I cannot do that  The fox said, I will help you, just lay yourself down, stretch yourself out as if you were dead, and do not stir  The horse did as the fox desired, and the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said, a dead horse is lying outside there, just come with me, you can have a rich meal  The lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, after all, it is not very convenient for you here - I tell you what - I will fasten it to you by the tail, and then you can drag it into your cave, and devour it in peace  This advice pleased the lion, he lay down, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, he kept quite quiet', " But the fox tied the lion's legs together with the horse's tail, and twisted and fastened all so well and so strongly that no strength could break it", ' When he had finished his work, he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, pull, white horse, pull  Then up sprang the horse at once, and drew the lion away with him', " The lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew out in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and dragged him over the country to his master's door", ' When the master saw the lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, you shall stay with me and fare well, and he gave him plenty to eat until he died   In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face', " Close by the king's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything", " Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water", " The king's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen", ' At this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted  And as she thus lamented someone said to her, "What ails you, king\'s daughter? You weep so that even a stone would show pity " She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water  "Ah, old water-splasher, is it you," she said, "I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well " "Be quiet, and do not weep," answered the frog, "I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your plaything up again?" "Whatever you will have, dear frog," said she, "My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing " The frog answered, "I do not care for your clothes, your pearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me and let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your little table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of your little cup, and sleep in your little bed - if you will promise me this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up again " "Oh yes," said she, "I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring me my ball back again " But she thought, "How the silly frog does talk  All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and croak  He can be no companion to any human being " But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down; and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass', " The king's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it", ' "Wait, wait," said the frog  "Take me with you', " I can't run as you can", '" But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could  She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again  The next day when she had seated herself at table with the king and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me " She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it  Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened  The king saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, "My child, what are you so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry you away?" "Ah, no," replied she  "It is no giant but a disgusting frog " "What does a frog want with you?" "Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water  And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water  And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me " In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me, do you not know what you said to me yesterday by the cool waters of the well A certain tailor who was great at boasting but ill at doing, took it into his head to go abroad for a while, and look about the world  As soon as he could manage it, he left his work-shop, and wandered on his way, over hill and dale, sometimes hither, sometimes, thither, but ever on and on  Once on his way he perceived in the blue distance a steep hill, and behind it a tower reaching to the clouds, which rose up out of a wild dark forest  Thunder and lightning, cried the tailor, what is that, and as he was strongly goaded by curiosity, he went boldly towards it  But how he did gaze and gape when he came near it, for the tower had legs, and leapt in one bound over the steep hill, and was now standing as an all-powerful giant before him', " What do you want here, you tiny fly's leg, cried the giant, with a voice as if it were thundering on every side", ' The tailor whimpered, I want just to look about and see if I can earn a bit of bread for myself, in this forest  If that is what you are after, said the giant, you may have a place with me  If it must be, why not  What wages shall I receive  You shall hear what wages you shall have  Every year three hundred and sixty-five days, and when it is leap-year, one more into the bargain  Does that suit you  All right, replied the tailor, and thought, in his own mind, a man must cut his coat according to his cloth  I will try to get away as fast as I can  At this the giant said to him, go, little ragamuffin, and fetch me a jug of water  Had I not better bring the well itself at once, and the spring too, asked the boaster, and went with the pitcher to the water  What, the well and the spring too, growled the giant in his beard, for he was somewhat of a silly dolt, and began to be afraid  That knave is not a fool, he has a mandrake in his body  Be on your guard, old Hans, this is no serving-man for you  When the tailor had brought the water, the giant bade him go into the forest, and cut a couple of blocks of wood and bring them back  Why not the whole forest, at once, with one stroke  The whole forest, young and old, with all that is there, both gnarled and smooth, and the well and its spring too, growled the credulous giant in his beard, and was still more terrified  The knave can do much more than bake apples, and has a mandrake in his body  Be on your guard, old Hans, this is no serving-man for you  When the tailor had brought the wood, the giant commanded him to shoot two or three wild boars for supper  Why not rather a thousand at one shot, and bring them all here, inquired the insolent tailor  What, cried the timid giant in great terror  Let well alone to-night, and lie down to rest  The giant was so terribly alarmed that he could not close an eye all night long for thinking what would be the best way to get rid of this accursed sorcerer of a servant A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and had nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind it  Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an old man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and said, why do you plague yourself with cutting wood, I will make you rich, if you will promise me what is standing behind your mill  What can that be but my apple-tree, thought the miller, and said, yes, and gave a written promise to the stranger  He, however, laughed mockingly and said, when three years have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me, and then he went  When the miller got home, his wife came to meet him and said, tell me, miller, from whence comes this sudden wealth into our house  All at once every box and chest was filled, no one brought it in, and I know not how it happened  He answered, it comes from a stranger who met me in the forest, and promised me great treasure', " I' in return, have promised him what stands behind the mill - we can very well give him the big apple-tree for it", ' Ah, husband, said the terrified wife, that must have been the devil  He did not mean the apple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill sweeping the yard', " The miller's daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived through the three years in the fear of God and without sin", ' When therefore the time was over, and the day came when the evil one was to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle round herself with chalk  The devil appeared quite early, but he could not come near to her  Angrily, he said to the miller, take all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to wash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her  The miller was afraid, and did so  The next morning the devil came again, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite clean  Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to the miller, cut her hands off, or else I have no power over her', " The miller was shocked and answered, how could I cut off my own child's hands", ' Then the evil one threatened him and said, if you do not do it you are mine, and I will take you yourself  The father became alarmed, and promised to obey him  So he went to the girl and said, my child, if I do not cut off both your hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror I have promised to do it  Help me in my need, and forgive me the harm I do you  She replied, dear father, do with me what you will, I am your child  Thereupon she laid down both her hands, and let them be cut off  The devil came for the third time, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that after all they were quite clean  Then he had to give in, and had lost all right over her  The miller said to her, I have by means of you received such great wealth that I will keep you most handsomely as long as you live  But she replied, here I cannot stay, I will go forth, compassionate people will give me as much as I require  Thereupon she caused her maimed arms to be bound to her back, and by sunrise she set out on her way, and walked the whole day until night fell  Then she came to a royal garden, and by the shimmering of the moon she saw that trees covered with beautiful fruits grew in it, but she could not enter, for it was surrounded by water Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things and win high honors  All that is needed is that he should go to the right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he should have good luck', " A civil, smart tailor's apprentice once went out traveling, and came into a great forest, and, as he did not know the way, he lost himself", ' Night fell and nothing was left for him to do in this painful solitude, but to seek a bed  He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he made up his mind to spend the night in a tree  He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it, and thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away  After he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light  It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes  He knocked boldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw a little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored stuff sewn together  Who are you, and what do you want, asked the man in a grumbling voice  I am a poor tailor, he answered, whom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning  Go your way, replied the old man in a surly voice, I will have nothing to do with tramps, seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere  Having said this, he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then offered him a very good bed in a corner  The weary tailor needed no rocking, but slept sweetly till morning, but even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had not been aroused by a great noise  A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut  The tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes on in haste, and hurried out  Then close by the hut, he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just preparing for a violent struggle  They rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling, and the air resounded with their cries', " For a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory, at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary's body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was finished off by a few strokes from the stag", ' The tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns  He had not much time to collect his thoughts, for it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and valley, wood and meadow  He held with both hands to the ends of the horns, and resigned himself to his fate  It seemed to him just as if he were flying away  At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor down  The tailor, more dead than alive, required some time to come to himself  When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door in the rock, that it sprang open  Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight  The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again  Whilst he was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock, which cried to him, enter without fear, no evil shall befall you  He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were carved signs which were unknown to him A poor man had so many children that he had already asked everyone in the world to be godfather, and when still another child was born, no one else was left whom he could invite  He knew not what to do, and, in his perplexity, he lay down and fell asleep  Then he dreamt that he was to go outside the gate, and ask the first person he met to be godfather  When he awoke, he determined to obey his dream, and went outside the gate, and asked the first person who came up to him to be godfather  The stranger presented him with a little glass of water, and said, this is a wonderful water, with it you can heal the sick, only you must see where death is standing', " If he is standing by the patient's head, give the patient some of the water and he will be healed, but if death is standing by his feet, all trouble will be in vain, for the sick man must die", ' From this time forth, the man could always say whether a patient could be saved or not, and became famous for his skill, and earned a great deal of money', " Once he was called in to the child of the king, and when he entered, he saw death standing by the child's head and cured it with the water, and he did the same a second time, but the third time death was standing by its feet, and then he knew the child had to die", ' Once the man thought he would visit the godfather, and tell him how he had succeeded with the water  But when he entered the house, the strangest things were going on within  On the first flight of stairs, the broom and shovel were disputing, and knocking each other about violently  He asked them, where does the godfather live  The broom replied, one flight of stairs higher up  When he came to the second flight, he saw a heap of dead fingers lying  He asked, where does the godfather live  One of the fingers replied, one flight of stairs higher  On the third flight lay a heap of dead heads, which again directed him to the flight beyond  On the fourth flight, he saw fishes on the fire, which frizzled in pans and baked themselves  They, too, said, one flight of stairs higher  And when he had ascended the fifth, he came to the door of a room and peeped through the keyhole, and there he saw the godfather who had a pair of long horns  When he opened the door and went in, the godfather got into bed in a great hurry and covered himself up  Then said the man, sir godfather, what a strange house-hold you have  When I came to your first flight of stairs, the shovel and broom were quarreling, and beating each other violently  How stupid you are, said the godfather  That was the boy and the maid talking to each other  But on the second flight I saw dead fingers lying  Oh, how silly you are  Those were some roots of scorzonera', " On the third flight lay a heap of dead men's heads", ' Foolish man, those were cabbages There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand to mouth  But it came to pass one day when the man was sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold  As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak and said, listen, fisherman, if you will throw me back again into the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle  Then the fisherman answered, of what use is a castle to me, if I have nothing to eat  The gold fish continued, that shall be taken care of, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you can desire  If that be true, said the man, then I can well do you a favor  Yes, said the fish, there is, however, the condition that you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all will be over  Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water, and went home  But where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle  He opened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and said, husband, how has all this come to pass  It suits me very well  Yes, said the man, it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just give me something to eat', " Said the wife, but I have got nothing and don't know where to find anything in this new house", ' There is no need of your knowing, said the man, for I see yonder a great cupboard, just unlock it  When she opened it, there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect  Then the woman cried joyfully, what more can you want, my dear  And they sat down, and ate and drank together  When they had had enough, the woman said, but husband, whence come all these riches  Alas, answered he, do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you anything  If I disclose it to anyone, then all our good fortune will disappear  Very good, said she, if I am not to know anything, then I do not want to know anything  However, she was not in earnest  She never rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty', " And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old fisherman's hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish", ' But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden fish  Listen, said the fish, if you will throw me back into the water again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats', " Only be firm, for your life's sake don't reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again", ' I will take good care, answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water  Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but curiosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it  The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret In olden times there was a king, who had behind his palace a beautiful pleasure-garden in which there was a tree that bore golden apples  When the apples were getting ripe they were counted, but on the very next morning one was missing  This was told to the king, and he ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the tree  The king had three sons, the eldest of whom he sent, as soon as night came on, into the garden, but when midnight came he could not keep himself from sleeping, and next morning again an apple was gone', " The following night the second son had to keep watch, but it fared no better with him, as soon as twelve o'clock had struck he fell asleep, and in the morning an apple was gone", ' Now it came to the turn of the third son to watch, and he was quite ready, but the king had not much trust in him, and thought that he would be of less use even than his brothers, but at last he let him go  The youth lay down beneath the tree, but kept awake, and did not let sleep master him  When it struck twelve, something rustled through the air, and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose feathers were all shining with gold  The bird alighted on the tree, and had just plucked off an apple, when the youth shot an arrow at him  The bird flew off, but the arrow had struck his plumage, and one of his golden feathers fell down  The youth picked it up, and the next morning took it to the king and told him what he had seen in the night  The king called his council together, and everyone declared that a feather like this was worth more than the whole kingdom  If the feather is so precious, declared the king, one alone will not do for me, I must and will have the whole bird  The eldest son set out, and trusting to his cleverness thought that he would easily find the golden bird  When he had gone some distance he saw a fox sitting at the edge of a wood so he cocked his gun and took aim at him  The fox cried, do not shoot me, and in return I will give you some good counsel  You are on the way to the golden bird, and this evening you will come to a village in which stand two inns opposite to one another  One of them is lighted up brightly, and all goes on merrily within, but do not go into it, go rather into the other, even though it looks like a bad one', " How can such a silly beast give wise advice, thought the king's son, and he pulled the trigger", ' But he missed the fox, who stretched out his tail and ran quickly into the wood  So he pursued his way, and by evening came to the village where the two inns were, in one they were singing and dancing, the other had a poor, miserable look  I should be a fool, indeed, he thought, if I were to go into the shabby tavern, and pass by the good one  So he went into the cheerful one, lived there in riot and revel, and forgot the bird and his father, and all good counsels  When many months had passed, and the eldest son did not come back home, the second set out, wishing to find the golden bird  The fox met him as he had met the eldest, and gave him the good advice of which he took no heed  He came to the two inns, and his brother was standing at the window of the one from which came the music, and called out to him  He could not resist, but went inside and lived only for pleasure', " Again some time passed, and then the king's youngest son wanted to set off and try his luck, but his father would not allow it", " It is of no use, said he, he will find the golden bird still less than his brothers, and if a mishap were to befall him he knows not how to help himself, he's not too bright at the best", ' But at last, as he had no peace, he let him go There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling, and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion  It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst  When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good-day, and said, do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine, I am so hungry and thirsty  But the clever son answered, if I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself, be off with you, and he left the little man standing and went on  But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up', " And this was the little grey man's doing", ' After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine  The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine  But the second son, too, said sensibly enough, what I give you will be taken away from myself, be off, and he left the little man standing and went on  His punishment, however, was not delayed, when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home  Then Dummling said, father, do let me go and cut wood  The father answered, your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it  But Dummling begged so long that at last he said, just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself  His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer  When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said, give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle, I am so hungry and thirsty  Dummling answered, I have only cinder-cake and sour beer, if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat  So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine  So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said, since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck  There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the roots  Then the little man took leave of him  Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold  He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night  Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers  The eldest thought, I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather, and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it  The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast  At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out, keep away, for goodness, sake keep away  But she did not understand why she was to keep away  The others are there, she thought, I may as well be there too, and ran to them, but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her  So they had to spend the night with the goose  The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it  In the winter time, when deep snow lay on the ground, a poor boy was forced to go out on a sledge to fetch wood  When he had gathered it together, and packed it, he wished, as he was so frozen with cold, not to go home at once, but to light a fire and warm himself a little  So he scraped away the snow, and as he was thus clearing the ground, he found a tiny golden key   Hereupon he thought that where the key was, the lock must be also, and dug in the ground and found an iron chest  "If the key does but fit it!" thought he; "no doubt there are precious things in that little box " He searched, but no keyhole was there  At last he discovered one, but so small that it was hardly visible  He tried it, and the key fitted it exactly  Then he turned it once round, and now we must wait until he has quite unlocked it and opened the lid, and then we shall learn what wonderful things were lying in that box   There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair, and sold her for seven talers  On the way home he had to pass a pond, and already from afar he heard the frogs crying, aik, aik, aik, aik  Well, said he to himself, they are talking without rhyme or reason, it is seven that I have received, not eight  When he got to the water, he cried to them, stupid animals that you are', " Don't you know better than that", ' It is seven thalers and not eight  The frogs, however, stuck to their, aik aik, aik, aik', " Come, then, if you won't believe it, I can count it out to you", ' And he took his money out of his pocket and counted out the seven talers, always reckoning four and twenty groschen to a taler  The frogs, however, paid no attention to his reckoning, but still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik  What, cried the peasant, quite angry, if you know better than I, count it yourselves, and threw all the money at them into the water  He stood still and wanted to wait until they were through and had returned to him what was his, but the frogs maintained their opinion and cried continually, aik, aik, aik, aik  And besides that, did not throw the money out again  He still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home', " Then he abused the frogs and cried, you water-splashers, you thick-heads, you goggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt one's ears, but you cannot count seven talers", " Do you think I'm going to stand here till you get through", ' And with that he went away, but the frogs still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik, after him till he went home sorely vexed  After a while he bought another cow, which he slaughtered, and he made the calculation that if he sold the meat well he might gain as much as the two cows were worth, and have the hide into the bargain  When therefore he got to the town with the meat, a great pack of dogs were gathered together in front of the gate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the meat, sniffed at it, and barked, wow, wow, wow  As there was no stopping him, the peasant said to him, yes, yes, I know quite well that you are saying wow, wow, wow, because you want some of the meat, but I should be in a fine state if I were to give it to you  The dog, however, answered nothing but wow, wow  Will you promise not to devour it all then, and will you go bail for your companions  Wow, wow, wow, said the dog  Well, if you insist on it, I will leave it for you, I know you well, and know whom you serve, but this I tell you, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with you, you can just bring it out to me  Thereupon he unloaded the meat and turned back again  The dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, wow, wow  The countryman, who heard them from afar, said to himself, hark, now they all want some, but the big one is responsible to me for it  When three days had passed, the countryman thought, to-night my money will be in my pocket, and was quite delighted  But no one would come and pay it  There is no trusting any one now, said he There was once upon a time a very old woman, who lived with her flock of geese in a remote clearing in the mountains, and there had a little house  The clearing was surrounded by a large forest, and every morning the old woman took her crutch and hobbled into it  There, however, she was quite active, more so than any one would have thought, considering her age, and collected grass for her geese, picked all the wild fruit she could reach, and carried everything home on her back  Anyone would have thought that the heavy load would have weighed her to the ground, but she always brought it safely home  If anyone met her, she greeted him quite courteously  Good day, dear countryman, it is a fine day  Ah, you wonder that I should drag grass about, but everyone must take his burden on his back  Nevertheless, people did not like to meet her if they could help it, and took by preference a round-about way, and when a father with his boys passed her, he whispered to them, beware of the old woman  She has claws beneath her gloves  She is a witch  One morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest  The sun shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept through the leaves, and he was full of joy and gladness  He had as yet met no one, when he suddenly perceived the old witch kneeling on the ground cutting grass with a sickle  She had already thrust a whole load into her bundle, and near it stood two baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears  But, good little mother, said he, how can you carry all that away', " I must carry it, dear sir, answered she, rich folk's children have no need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the saying goes, don't look behind you, you will only see how crooked your back is", ' Will you help me, she said, as he remained standing by her  You have still a straight back and young legs, it would be a trifle to you  Besides, my house is not so very far from here, it stands there on the heath behind the hill  How soon you would bound up thither  The young man took compassion on the old woman  My father is certainly no peasant, replied he, but a rich count  Nevertheless, that you may see that it is not only peasants who can carry things, I will take your bundle  If you will try it, said she, I shall be very glad  You will certainly have to walk for an hour, but what will that matter to you, only you must carry the apples and pears as well', " The young man felt somewhat uneasy when he heard of an hour's walk, but the old woman would not let him off, packed the bundle on his back, and hung the two baskets on his arm", ' See, it is quite light, said she  No, it is not light, answered the count, and pulled a rueful face  Verily, the bundle weighs as heavily as if it were full of cobblestones, and the apples and pears are as heavy as lead  I can scarcely breathe There was once upon a time an old queen whose husband had been dead for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter  When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance  When the time came for her to be married, and she had to journey forth into the distant kingdom, the aged queen packed up for her many costly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver, and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart', " She likewise sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to ride with her, and hand her over to the bridegroom, and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of the king's daughter was called falada, and could speak", ' So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother went into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled  Then she held a white handkerchief to it into which she let three drops of blood fall, gave it to her daughter and said, dear child, preserve this carefully, it will be of service to you on your way  So they took a sorrowful leave of each other, the princess put the piece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to her bridegroom  After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said to her waiting-maid, dismount, and take my cup which you have brought with you for me, and get me some water from the stream, for I should like to drink', " If you are thirsty, said the waiting-maid, get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink out of the water, I don't choose to be your servant", ' So in her great thirst the princess alighted, bent down over the water in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup  Then she said, ah, heaven, and the three drops of blood answered, if this your mother knew, her heart would break in two', " But the king's daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse again", " She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched her, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to a stream of water, she again cried to her waiting-maid, dismount, and give me some water in my golden cup, for she had long ago forgotten the girl's ill words", " But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily, if you wish to drink, get it yourself, I don't choose to be your maid", " Then in her great thirst the king's daughter alighted, bent over the flowing stream, wept and said, ah, heaven, and the drops of blood again replied, if this your mother knew, her heart would break in two", ' And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and floated away with the water without her observing it, so great was her trouble  The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to think that she had now power over the bride, for since the princess had lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless  So now when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called falada, the waiting-maid said, falada is more suitable for me, and my nag will do for you, and the princess had to be content with that  Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess exchange her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes, and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not say one word of this to anyone at the royal court, and if she had not taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot  But falada saw all this, and observed it well  The waiting-maid now mounted falada, and the true bride the bad horse, and thus they traveled onwards, until at length they entered the royal palace  There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the prince sprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, and thought she was his consort  She was conducted upstairs, but the real princess was left standing below  Then the old king looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard, and noticed how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was, and instantly went to the royal apartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard, and who she was  I picked her up on my way for a companion, give the girl something to work at, that she may not stand idle  But the old king had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said, I have a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him  The boy was called conrad, and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese  Soon afterwards the false bride said to the young king, dearest husband, I beg you to do me a favor  He answered, I will do so most willingly  Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horse on which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his fields and gardens  The corn was growing up vigorously and the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit  The grain of the year before still lay in such immense heaps in the loft that the rafters could hardly bear it  Then he went into the stable, where were well-fed oxen, fat cows, and horses bright as looking-glass  At length he went back into his sitting-room, and cast a glance at the iron chest in which his money lay  Whilst he was thus standing surveying his riches, all at once there was a loud knock close by him  The knock was not at the door of his room, but at the door of his heart  It opened, and he heard a voice which said to him, have you done good to your family with it  Have you considered the necessities of the poor  Have you shared your bread with the hungry  Have you been contented with what you have, or did you always desire to have more  The heart was not slow in answering, I have been hard and pitiless, and have never shown any kindness to my own family  If a beggar came, I turned away my eyes from him  I have not troubled myself about God, but have thought only of increasing my wealth  If everything which the sky covers had been mine own, I should still not have had enough  When he was aware of this answer he was greatly alarmed, his knees began to tremble, and he was forced to sit down  Then there was another knock, but the knock was at the door of his room  It was his neighbor, a poor man who had a number of children whom he could no longer satisfy with food  I know, thought the poor man, that my neighbor is rich, but he is as hard as he is rich', " I don't believe he will help me, but my children are crying for bread, so I will venture it", ' He said to the rich man, you do not readily give away anything that is yours, but I stand here like one who feels the water rising above his head  My children are starving, lend me four measures of corn  The rich man looked at him long, and then the first sunbeam of mercy began to melt away a drop of the ice of greediness  I will not lend you four measures, he answered  I will make you a present of eight, but you must fulfil one condition  What am I to do, said the poor man  When I am dead, you shall watch for three nights by my grave  The peasant was disturbed in his mind at this request, but in the need in which he was, he would have consented to anything  He accepted, therefore, and carried the corn home with him  It seemed as if the rich man had foreseen what was about to happen, for when three days were gone by, he suddenly dropped down dead There was once upon a time a king, but where he reigned and what he was called, I do not know  He had no son, but an only daughter who had always been ill, and no doctor had been able to cure her  Then it was foretold to the king that his daughter would find her health by eating an apple  So he ordered it to be proclaimed throughout the whole of his kingdom, that whosoever brought his daughter an apple with which she could find her health, should have her to wife, and be king', " This became known to a peasant who had three sons, and he said to the eldest, go out into the garden and take a basketful of those beautiful apples with the red cheeks and carry them to the court, perhaps the king's daughter will be able to find her health with them, and then you will marry her and be king", ' The lad did so, and set out  When he had gone a short way he met a hoary little man who asked him what he had there in the basket, to which replied uele for so was he named, frogs, legs  At this the little man said, well, so shall it be, and remain, and went away', " At length uele arrived at the palace, and made it known that he had brought apples which would cure the king's daughter if she ate them", ' This delighted the king hugely, and he caused uele to be brought before him, but, alas  When he opened the basket, instead of having apples in it he had frogs, legs which were still kicking about  On this the king grew angry, and had him driven out of the house  When he got home he told his father how it had fared with him  Then the father sent the next son, who was called same, but all went with him just as it had gone with uele  He also met the hoary little man, who asked what he had there in the basket  Same said, hogs, bristles, and the hoary man said, well, so shall it be, and remain', " When same got to the king's palace and said he brought apples with which the king's daughter might find her health, they did not want to let him go in, and said that one fellow had already been there, and had treated them as if they were fools", ' Same, however, maintained that he certainly had the apples, and that they ought to let him go in  At length they believed him, and led him to the king  But when he uncovered the basket, he had but hogs, bristles  This enraged the king most terribly, so he caused same to be whipped out of the house  When he got home he related all that had befallen him, whereupon the youngest boy, whose name was Hans, but who was always called stupid Hans, came and asked his father if he might go with some apples  Oh, said the father, you would be just the right fellow for such a thing', " If the clever one can't manage it, what can you do", ' The boy, however, insisted and said, indeed, father, I wish to go  Just get away, you stupid fellow, you must wait till you are wiser, said the father to that, and turned his back  Hans, however, pulled at the back of his smock and said, indeed, father, I wish to go  Well, then, so far as I am concerned you may go, but you will soon come home again, replied the old man in a spiteful voice  The boy was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy  Well, act like a fool This story, my dear young folks, seems to be false, but it really is true, for my grandfather, from whom I have it, used always, when relating it, to say, it must be true, my son, or else no one could tell it to you  The story is as follows  One sunday morning about harvest time, just as the buckwheat was in bloom, the sun was shining brightly in heaven, the east wind was blowing warmly over the stubble-fields, the larks were singing in the air, the bees buzzing among the buckwheat, the people in their sunday clothes were all going to church, and all creatures were happy, and the hedgehog was happy too  The hedgehog, however, was standing by his door with his arms akimbo, enjoying the morning breezes, and slowly trilling a little song to himself, which was neither better nor worse than the songs which hedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed sunday morning  Whilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself, it suddenly occurred to him that, while his wife was washing and drying the children, he might very well take a walk into the field, and see how his turnips were getting on  The turnips, in fact, were close beside his house, and he and his family were accustomed to eat them, for which reason he looked upon them as his own  No sooner said than done  The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him, and took the path to the field  He had not gone very far from home, and was just turning round the sloe-bush which stands there outside the field, to go up into the turnip-field, when he observed the hare who had gone out on business of the same kind, namely, to visit his cabbages  When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare, he bade him a friendly good morning', " But the hare, who was in his own way a distinguished gentleman, and frightfully haughty, did not return the hedgehog's greeting, but said to him, assuming at the same time a very contemptuous manner, how do you happen to be running about here in the field so early in the morning", ' I am taking a walk, said the hedgehog  A walk, said the hare, with a smile  It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better purpose  This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry, for he can bear anything but a reference too his legs, just because they are crooked by nature  So now the hedgehog said to the hare, you seem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with mine  That is just what I do think, said the hare  That can be put to the test, said the hedgehog  I wager that if we run a race, I will outstrip you  That is ridiculous  You with your short legs, said the hare, but for my part I am willing, if you have such a monstrous fancy for it  What shall we wager', " A golden louis-d'or and a bottle of brandy, said the hedgehog", ' Done, said the hare  Shake hands on it, and then we may as well begin at once  Nay, said the hedgehog, there is no such great hurry  I am still fasting, I will go home first, and have a little breakfast  In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place  Hereupon the hedgehog departed, for the hare was quite satisfied with this  On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, the hare relies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better of him There was once a woman and her daughter who lived in a pretty garden with cabbages  And a little hare came into it, and during the winter time ate all the cabbages  Then says the mother to the daughter, go into the garden, and chase the hare away  The girl says to the little hare, sh-sh, hare, you will be eating all our cabbages', " Says the hare, come, maiden, and seat yourself on my little hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut", ' The girl will not do it  Next day the hare comes again and eats the cabbages, then says the mother to the daughter, go into the garden, and drive the hare away  The girl says to the hare, sh-sh, little hare, you will be eating all the cabbages', " The little hare says, maiden, seat yourself on my little hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut", ' The maiden refuses  The third day the hare comes again, and eats the cabbages  On this the mother says to the daughter, go into the garden, and hunt the hare away  Says the maiden, sh-sh, little hare, you will be eating all our cabbages', " Says the little hare, come, maiden, seat yourself on my little hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut", " The girl seats herself on the little hare's tail, and then the hare takes her far away to his little hut, and says, now cook green cabbage and millet-seed, and I will invite the wedding-guests", ' Then all the wedding-guests assembled  Who were the wedding-guests? That I can tell you as another told it to me  They were all hares, and the crow was there as parson to marry the bride and bridegroom, and the fox as clerk, and the altar was under the rainbow  The girl, however, was sad, for she was all alone  The little hare comes and says, open the doors, open the doors, the wedding-guests are merry  The bride says nothing, but weeps  The little hare goes away  The little hare comes back and says, take off the lid, take off the lid, the wedding-guests are hungry  The bride again says nothing, and weeps  The little hare goes away  The little hare comes back and says, take off the lid, take off the lid, the wedding-guests are waiting  Then the bride says nothing, and the hare goes away, but she dresses a straw-doll in her clothes, and gives her a spoon to stir with, and sets her by the pan with the millet-seed, and goes back to her mother  The little hare comes once more and says, take off the lid, take off the lid, and gets up, and strikes the doll on the head so that her cap falls off  Then the little hare sees that it is not his bride, and goes away and is sorrowful   One afternoon the christ-child had laid himself in his cradle-bed and had fallen asleep  Then his mother came to him, looked at him full of gladness, and said, have you laid yourself down to sleep, my child  Sleep sweetly, and in the meantime, I will go into the wood, and fetch you a handful of strawberries, for I know that you will be pleased with them when you awake  In the wood outside, she found a spot with the most beautiful strawberries, but as she was stooping to gather one, an adder sprang up out of the grass  She was alarmed, left the strawberries where they were, and hastened away  The adder darted after her, but our lady, as you can readily understand, knew what it was best to do  She hid herself behind a hazel-bush, and stood there until the adder had crept away again  Then she gathered the strawberries, and as she set out on her way home she said, as the hazel-bush has been my protection this time, it shall in future protect others also  Therefore, from the most remote times, a green hazel-branch has been the safest protection against adders, snakes, and everything else which creeps on the earth   A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the edge of a lonely forest  One morning as he was about to go to his work, he said to his wife, let our eldest daughter bring me my dinner into the forest, or I shall never get my work done, and in order that she may not miss her way, he added, I will take a bag of millet with me and strew the seeds on the path  When, therefore, the sun was just above the centre of the forest, the girl set out on her way with a bowl of soup, but the field-sparrows, and wood-sparrows, larks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked up the millet long before, and the girl could not find the track  Trusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and night began to fall  The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and she began to be afraid  Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the trees  There ought to be some people living there, who can take me in for the night, thought she, and went up to the light  It was not long before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up  She knocked, and a rough voice from inside cried, come in  The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of the room  Just come in, cried the voice, and when she opened the door, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the table, supporting his face with both hands, and his white beard fell down over the table almost as far as the ground  By the stove lay three animals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow  The girl told her story to the old man, and begged for shelter for the night  The man said,        my pretty hen,        my pretty cock,        my pretty brindled cow,        what are you saying now  Duks, answered the animals, and that must have meant, we are willing, for the old man said, here you shall have shelter and food, go to the fire, and cook us our supper  The girl found in the kitchen abundance of everything, and cooked a good supper, but had no thought of the animals  She carried the full bowl to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man, ate and satisfied her hunger  When she had had enough, she said, but now I am tired, where is there a bed in which I can lie down, and sleep  The animals replied,        thou hast eaten with him,        thou hast drunk with him,        thou hast had no thought for us,        so find out for thyself where thou canst pass the        night  Then said the old man, just go upstairs, and you will find a room with two beds, shake them up, and put white linen on them, and then I, too, will come and lie down to sleep  The girl went up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets on, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for the old man  After some time the gray-haired man came, held his candle over the girl and shook his head  When he saw that she had fallen into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her down into the cellar  Late at night, the wood-cutter came home, and reproached his wife for leaving him to hunger all day  It is not my fault, she replied, the girl went out with your dinner, and must have lost herself, but surely she will come back to-morrow  The wood-cutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the forest, and requested that the second daughter should take him his dinner that day', " I will take a bag with lentils, said he, the seeds are larger than millet, the girl will see them better, and can't lose her way", ' At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took out the food, but the lentils had disappeared  The birds of the forest had picked them up as they had done the day before, and had left none  The girl wandered about in the forest until night, and then she too reached the house of the old man, was told to go in, and begged for food and a bed' ,  "In the days when wishing was still of some use, a king's son was bewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest", ' There he passed many years, and no one could rescue him', " Then a king's daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could not find her father's kingdom again", ' After she had wandered about for nine days, she at length came to the iron stove  Then a voice came forth from it, and asked her, "Whence do you come, and whither are you going?" She answered, "I have lost my father\'s kingdom, and cannot get home again " Then a voice inside the iron stove said, "I will help you to get home again, and that indeed most swiftly, if you will promise to do what I desire of you  I am the son of a far greater king than your father, and I will marry you " Then was she afraid, and thought, "Good heavens  What can I do with an iron stove?" But as she much wished to get home to her father, she promised to do as he desired  But he said, "You shall return here, and bring a knife with you, and scrape a hole in the iron " Then he gave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, and in two hours he took her home', " There was great joy in the castle when the king's daughter came home, and the old king fell on her neck and kissed her", ' She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, "Dear father, what I have suffered  I should never have got home again from the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I have been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it free, and marry it " Then the old king was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he had but this one daughter', " They therefore resolved they would send, in her place, the miller's daughter, who was very beautiful", ' They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the iron stove  So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but could not bring off the least morsel of it  When the day dawned, a voice in the stove said, "It seems to me it is day outside " Then she answered, "It seems so to me too, I fancy I hear the noise of my father\'s mill " "So you are a miller\'s daughter', " Then go your way at once, and let the king's daughter come here", '" Then she went away at once, and told the old king that the man outside there would have none of her - he wanted the king\'s daughter  Then the old king grew frightened, and the daughter wept', " But there was a swine-herd's daughter, who was even prettier than the miller's daughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the king's daughter", ' So she was taken thither and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours  She, however, was no better at it  When the day broke, a voice inside the stove cried, "It seems to me it is day outside " Then answered she, "So it seems to me also, I fancy I hear my father\'s horn blowing " "Then you are a swineherd\'s daughter There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly  He was every morning the first out of bed, and the last to go to rest at night, and whenever there was a difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he was always the first to set himself to it  Moreover, he never complained, but was contented with everything and always merry  When a year was ended, his master gave him no wages, for he said to himself, that is the cleverest way, for I shall save something and he will not go away, but stay quietly in my service  The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done it the first, and when at the end of this, likewise, he received no wages, he submitted and still stayed on  When the third year also was past, the master considered, put his hand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out  Then at last the servant said, master, for three years I have served you honestly, be so good as to give me what I ought to have, for I wish to leave, and look about me a little more in the world  Yes, my good fellow, answered the old miser, you have served me industriously, and therefore you shall be graciously rewarded  And he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three farthings, saying, there, you have a farthing for each year, that is large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from few masters  The honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought, ah, now that I have my purse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work', " So on he went, up hill and down dale, and sang and jumped to his heart's content", ' Now it came to pass that as he was going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to him, whither away, merry brother  I see you do not carry many cares  Why should I be sad, answered the servant, I have enough  Three years, wages are jingling in my pocket  How much is your treasure, the dwarf asked him  How much  Three farthings sterling, all told  Look here, said the dwarf, I am a poor needy man, give me your three farthings, I can work no longer but you are young, and can easily earn your bread  And as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the little man, he gave him the three farthings, saying, take them in the name of heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it  Then the little man said, as I see you have a good heart I grant you three wishes, one for each farthing, they shall all be fulfilled  Aha, said the servant, you are one of those who can work wonders  Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for a gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at, secondly, for a fiddle, which when I play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance, thirdly, that if I ask a favor of any one he shall not be able to refuse it  All that shall you have, said the dwarf, and put his hand into the bush, and just imagine, there lay a fiddle and gun, all ready, just as if they had been ordered  These he gave to the servant, and then said to him, whatever you may ask at any time, no man in the world shall be able to deny you  Heart alive  What more can one desire, said the servant, to himself, and went merrily onwards', " Soon afterwards he met a Jew with a long goat's beard, who was standing listening to the song of a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree", ' Good heavens, he was exclaiming, that such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice  If it were but mine It is now long ago, quite two thousand years, since there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly  They had, however, no children, though they wished for them very much, and the woman prayed for them day and night, but still they had none  Now there was a court-yard in front of their house in which was a juniper tree, and one day in winter the woman was standing beneath it, paring herself an apple, and while she was paring herself the apple she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow  Ah, said the woman, and sighed right heavily, and looked at the blood before her, and was most unhappy, ah, if I had but a child as red as blood and as white as snow  And while she thus spoke, she became quite happy in her mind, and felt just as if that were going to happen  Then she went into the house and a month went by and the snow was gone, and two months, and then everything was green, and three months, and then all the flowers came out of the earth, and four months, and then all the trees in the wood grew thicker, and the green branches were all closely entwined, and the birds sang until the wood resounded and the blossoms fell from the trees, then the fifth month passed away and she stood under the juniper tree, which smelt so sweetly that her heart leapt, and she fell on her knees and was beside herself with joy, and when the sixth month was over the fruit was large and fine, and then she was quite still, and the seventh month she snatched at the juniper-berries and ate them greedily, then she grew sick and sorrowful, then the eighth month passed, and she called her husband to her, and wept and said, if I die then bury me beneath the juniper tree  Then she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she beheld it she was so delighted that she died  Then her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to weep sore, after some time he was more at ease, and though he still wept he could bear it, and after some time longer he took another wife', " By the second wife he had a daughter, but the first wife's child was a little son, and he was as red as blood and as white as snow", ' When the woman looked at her daughter she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy and it seemed to cut her to the heart, for the thought came into her mind that he would always stand in her way, and she was for ever thinking how she could get all the fortune for her daughter, and the evil one filled her mind with this till she was quite wroth with the little boy and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was in continual terror, for when he came out of school he had no peace in any place  One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, and her little daughter went up too, and said, mother, give me an apple  Yes, my child, said the woman, and gave her a fine apple out of the chest, but the chest had a great heavy lid with a great sharp iron lock  Mother, said the little daughter, is brother not to have one too  This made the woman angry, but she said, yes, when he comes out of school  And when she saw from the window that he was coming, it was just as if the devil entered into her, and she snatched at the apple and took it away again from her daughter, and said, you shall not have one before your brother  Then she threw the apple into the chest, and shut it  Then the little boy came in at the door, and the devil made her say to him kindly, my son, will you have an apple  And she looked wickedly at him  Mother, said the little boy, how dreadful you look  Yes, give me an apple  Then it seemed to her as if she were forced to say to him, come with me, and she opened the lid of the chest and said, take out an apple for yourself, and while the little boy was stooping inside, the devil prompted her, and crash  She shut the lid down, and his head flew off and fell among the red apples  Then she was overwhelmed with terror, and thought, if I could but make them think that it was not done by me  So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white handkerchief out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, and folded the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and she set him on a chair in front of the door, and put the apple in his hand  After this Marlinchen came into the kitchen to her mother, who was standing by the fire with a pan of hot water before her which she was constantly stirring round  "Mother," said Marlinchen, "brother is sitting at the door, and he looks quite white and has an apple in his hand  I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was quite frightened " "Go back to him," said her mother, "and if he will not answer you, give him a box on the ear " So Marlinchen went to him and said, "Brother, give me the apple " But he was silent, and she gave him a box on the ear, whereupon his head fell off There was a certain merchant who had two children, a boy and a girl, they were both young, and could not walk  And two richly-laden ships of his sailed forth to sea with all his property on board, and just as he was expecting to win much money by them, news came that they had gone to the bottom, and now instead of being a rich man he was a poor one, and had nothing left but one field outside the town  In order to drive his misfortune a little out of his thoughts, he went out to this field, and as he was walking to and fro in it, a little black mannikin stood suddenly by his side, and asked why he was so sad, and what he was taking so much to heart  Then said the merchant, if you could help me I would willingly tell you  Who knows, replied the black dwarf  Perhaps, I can help you  Then the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea, and that he had nothing left but this field  Do not trouble yourself, said the dwarf  If you will promise to give me the first thing that rubs itself against your leg when you are at home again, and to bring it here to this place in twelve years, time, you shall have as much money as you will  The merchant thought, what can that be but my dog, and did not remember his little boy, so he said yes, gave the black man a written and sealed promise, and went home  When he reached home, his little boy was so delighted that he held himself by a bench, trotted up to him and seized him fast by the legs  The father was shocked, for he remembered his promise, and now knew what he had pledged himself to do, as however, he still found no money in his chest, he thought the dwarf had only been jesting  A month afterwards he went up to the garret, intending to gather together some old tin and to sell it, and saw lying there a great heap of money  Then he was happy again, made purchases, became a greater merchant than before, and felt that God was good to him  In the meantime the boy grew tall, and at the same time bright and clever  But the nearer the twelfth year approached the more anxious grew the merchant, so that his distress might be seen in his face  One day his son asked what ailed him, but the father would not say  The boy, however, persisted so long, that at last he told him that without being aware of what he was doing, he had promised him to a black dwarf, and had received much money for doing so  He said likewise that he had set his hand and seal to this, and that now when twelve years had gone by he would have to give him up  Then said the son, oh, father, do not be uneasy, all will go well  The black man has no power over me  The son had himself blessed by the priest, and when the time came, father and son went together to the field, and the son made a circle and placed himself inside it with his father  Then came the black dwarf and said to the old man, have you brought with you that which you have promised me  He was silent, but the son asked, what do you want here? Then said the black dwarf, I have to speak with your father, and not with you  The son replied, you have betrayed and misled my father, give back the writing  No, said the black dwarf, I will not give up my rights  They spoke together for a long time after this, but at last they agreed that the son, as he did not belong to the enemy of mankind, nor yet to his father, should seat himself in a small boat, which should lie on water which was flowing away from them, and that the father should push it off with his own foot, and then the son should remain given up to the water  So he took leave of his father, placed himself in a little boat, and the father had to push it off with his own foot  The boat capsized so that the keel was uppermost and the deck under water, and the father believed his son was lost, and went home and mourned for him  The boat, however, did not sink, but floated quietly away, and the boy sat safely inside it, and it floated thus for a long time, until at last it ran into an unknown shore' ,  "There was once a king's son, who was no longer content to stay at home in his father's house, and as he had no fear of anything, he thought, I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not seem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough", ' So he took leave of his parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night, and whichever way his path led it was the same to him  It came to pass that he arrived at the house of a giant, and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested', " And as he let his eyes roam here and there, he saw the giant's playthings lying in the yard", ' These were a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man  After a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled the balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins fell, and had a merry time of it  The giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and saw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his nine-pins  "Little worm," cried he, "why are you playing with my balls? Who gave you strength to do it?" The king\'s son looked up, saw the giant, and said, "Oh, you blockhead, you think indeed that you only have strong arms, I can do everything I want to do " The giant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and said, "Child of man, if you are one of that kind, go and bring me an apple of the tree of life " "What do you want with it?" said the king\'s son  "I do not want the apple for myself," answered the giant, "but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it  I have traveled far about the world and cannot find the tree " "I will soon find it," said the king\'s son, "and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down " The giant said, "You really believe it to be so easy  The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each close to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in " "They will be sure to let me in," said the king\'s son  "Yes, but even if you do get into the garden, and see the apple hanging to the tree, it is still not yours  A ring hangs in front of it, through which any one who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand, and no one has yet had the luck to do it " "That luck will be mine," said the king\'s son  Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth over mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at length he came to the wondrous garden  The beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and were asleep  Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them, so he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the garden  There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and the red apples were shining upon the branches  He climbed up the trunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he saw a ring hanging before it, but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty, and picked the apple  The ring closed tightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins  When he had come down again from the tree with the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the great gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash  Then he went out, and the lion which had been lying in front of the gate, was awake and sprang after him, not in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master  The king\'s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, "You see, I have brought it without difficulty " The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished  She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, "I shall never believe that you have brought the apple, until I see the ring on your arm There were once three brothers who had fallen deeper and deeper into poverty, and at last their need was so great that they had to endure hunger, and had nothing to eat or drink  Then said they, it cannot go on like this, we had better go into the world and seek our fortune  They therefore set out, and had already walked over many a long road and many a blade of grass, but had not yet met with good luck  One day they arrived in a great forest, and in the midst of it was a hill, and when they came nearer they saw that the hill was all silver  Then spoke the eldest, now I have found the good luck I wished for, and I desire nothing more  He took as much of the silver as he could possibly carry, and then turned back and went home again  But the two others said, we want something more from good luck than mere silver, and did not touch it, but went onwards  After they had walked for two days longer without stopping, they came to a hill which was all gold  The second brother stopped, took thought with himself, and was undecided  What shall I do, said he, shall I take for myself so much of this gold, that I have sufficient for all the rest of my life, or shall I go farther  At length he made a decision, and putting as much into his pockets as would go in, said farewell to his brother, and went home  But the third said, silver and gold do not move me, I will not renounce my chance of fortune, perhaps something better still will be given me  He journeyed onwards, and when he had walked for three days, he came to a forest which was still larger than the one before, and never would come to an end, and as he found nothing to eat or to drink, he was all but exhausted  Then he climbed up a high tree to find out if up there he could see the end of the forest, but so far as his eye could pierce he saw nothing but the tops of trees  Then he began to descend the tree again, but hunger tormented him, and he thought to himself, if I could but eat my fill once more  When he got down he saw with astonishment a table beneath the tree richly spread with food, the steam of which rose up to meet him  This time, said he, my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment  And without inquiring who had brought the food, or who had cooked it, he approached the table, and ate with enjoyment until he had appeased his hunger  When he was done, he thought, it would after all be a pity if the pretty little table-cloth were to be spoilt in the forest here, and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket  Then he went onwards, and in the evening, when hunger once more returned to him, he wanted to make a trial of his little cloth, and spread it out and said, I wish you to be covered with good cheer again, and scarcely had the wish crossed his lips than as many dishes with the most exquisite food on them stood on the table as there was room for  Now I perceive, said he, in what kitchen my cooking is done  You shall be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold  For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth  The cloth, however, was still not enough to enable him to sit down quietly at home, he preferred to wander about the world and pursue his fortune farther  One night he met, in a lonely wood, a dusty, black charcoal-burner, who was burning charcoal there, and had some potatoes by the fire, on which he was going to make a meal  Good evening, blackbird, said the youth  How do you get on in your solitude  One day is like another, replied the charcoal-burner, and every night potatoes  Have you a mind to have some, and will you be my guest', " Many thanks, replied the traveler, I won't rob you of your supper, you did not reckon on a visitor, but if you will put up with what I have, you shall have an invitation" ,  'There were once a little brother and a little sister, who loved each other with all their hearts  Their own mother, however, was dead, and they had a step-mother who was not kind to them, and secretly did everything she could to hurt them  It so happened that the two were playing with other children in a meadow before the house, and there was a pond in the meadow which came up to one side of the house  The children ran about it, and caught each other, and played at counting out       Eneke beneke, let me live,      and I to you my bird will give', "      The little bird, it straw shall seek,      the straw I'll give to the cow to eat", "      The pretty cow shall give me milk,      the milk I'll to the baker take", "      The baker he shall bake a cake,      the cake I'll give unto the cat", "      The cat shall catch some mice for that,      the mice I'll hang up in the smoke,      and then you'll see the snow", ' They stood in a circle while they played this, and the one to whom the word snow fell, had to run away and all the others ran after him and caught him  As they were running about so merrily the step-mother watched them from the window, and grew angry  And as she understood arts of witchcraft she bewitched them both, and changed the little brother into a fish, and the little sister into a lamb  Then the fish swam here and there about the pond and was very sad, and the lambkin walked up and down the meadow, and was miserable, and could not eat or touch one blade of grass  Thus passed a long time, and then strangers came as visitors to the castle  The false step-mother thought, this is a good opportunity, and called the cook and said to him, go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and kill it, we have nothing else for the visitors  Then the cook went away and got the lamb, and took it into the kitchen and tied its feet, and all this it bore patiently  When he had drawn out his knife and was whetting it on the door-step to kill the lamb, he noticed a little fish swimming backwards and forwards in the water, in front of the gutter-stone and looking up at him  This, however, was the brother, for when the fish saw the cook take the lamb away, it followed them and swam along the pond to the house, then the lamb cried down to it,      ah, brother, in the pond so deep,      how sad is my poor heart       The cook he whets his knife      to take away my life  The little fish answered,      ah, little sister, up on high      how sad is my poor heart      while in this pond I lie  When the cook heard that the lambkin could speak and said such sad words to the fish down below, he was terrified and thought this could be no common lamb, but must be bewitched by the wicked woman in the house  Then said he, be easy, I will not kill you, and took another sheep and made it ready for the guests, and conveyed the lambkin to a good peasant woman, to whom he related all that he had seen and heard  The peasant, however, was the very woman who had been foster-mother to the little sister, and she suspected at once who the lamb was, and went with it to a wise woman  Then the wise woman pronounced a blessing over the lambkin and the little fish, by means of which they regained their human forms, and after this she took them both into a little hut in a great forest, where they lived alone, but were contented and happy   In a certain village there once lived a man and his wife, and the wife was so lazy that she would never work at anything  Whatever her husband gave her to spin, she did not get done, and what she did spin she did not wind, but let it all remain entangled in a heap  If the man scolded her, she was always ready with her tongue, and said, well, how should I wind it, when I have no reel  Just you go into the forest and get me one  If that is all, said the man, then I will go into the forest, and get some wood for making reels  Then the woman was afraid that if he had the wood he would make her a reel of it, and she would have to wind her yarn off, and then begin to spin again  She bethought herself a little, and then a lucky idea occurred to her, and she secretly followed the man into the forest, and when he had climbed into a tree to choose and cut the wood, she crept into the thicket below where he could not see her, and cried,   he who cuts wood for reels shall die,   and he who winds, shall perish  The man listened, laid down his axe for a moment, and began to consider what that could mean', " Well, he said at last, what can that have been, my ears must have been singing, I won't alarm myself for nothing", ' So he once more seized the axe, and began to hew  Then again there came a cry from below,   he who cuts wood for reels shall die,   and he who winds, shall perish  He stopped, and felt afraid and alarmed, and pondered over the circumstance  But when a few moments had passed, he took heart again, and a third time he stretched out his hand for the axe, and began to cut  But someone called out a third time, and said loudly,   he who cuts wood for reels shall die,   and he who winds, shall perish  That was enough for him, and all inclination had departed from him, so he hastily descended the tree, and set out on his way home  The woman ran as fast as she could by byways so as to get home first  So when he entered the parlor, she put on an innocent look as if nothing had happened, and said, well, have you brought a nice piece of wood for reels', " No, said he, I see very well that winding won't do, and told her what had happened to him in the forest, and from that time forth left her in peace about it", ' Neverthless after some time, the man again began to complain of the disorder in the house  Wife, said he, it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie there all entangled', " I'll tell you what, said she, as we still don't come by any reel, go you up into the loft, and I will stand down below, and will throw the yarn up to you, and you will throw it down to me, and so we shall get a skein after all", ' Yes, that will do, said the man  So they did that, and when it was done, he said, the yarn is in skeins, now it must be boiled  The woman was again distressed, and said, yes, we will boil it to-morrow morning early  But she was secretly contriving another trick  Early in the morning she got up, lighted a fire, and put the kettle on, only instead of the yarn, she put in a lump of tow and let it boil  After that she went to the man who was still lying in bed, and said to him, I must just go out, you must get up and look after the yarn which is in the kettle on the fire, but you must be at hand at once, mind that, for if the cock should happen to crow, and you are not attending to the yarn, it will become tow  The man was willing and took good care not to loiter  He got up as quickly as he could, and went into the kitchen  But when he reached the kettle and peeped in, he saw, to his horror, nothing but a lump of tow A tailor and a goldsmith were traveling together, and one evening when the sun had sunk behind the mountains, they heard the sound of distant music, which became more and more distinct  It sounded strange, but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly onwards', " The moon had already arisen when they reached a hill on which they saw a crowd of little men and women, who had taken each other's hands, and were whirling round in the dance with the greatest pleasure and delight", ' They sang to it most charmingly, and that was the music which the travelers had heard  In the midst of them sat an old man who was rather taller than the rest  He wore a parti-colored coat, and his hoary beard hung down over his breast  The two remained standing full of astonishment, and watched the dance  The old man made a sign that they should enter, and the little folks willingly opened their circle  The goldsmith, who had a hump, and like all hunch-backs was daring enough, stepped in  The tailor felt a little afraid at first, and held back, but when he saw how merrily all was going, he plucked up his courage, and followed  The circle closed again directly, and the little folks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps  The old man, however, took a large knife which hung to his girdle, whetted it, and when it was sufficiently sharpened, he looked round at the strangers  They were terrified, but they had not much time for reflection, for the old man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed, shaved the hair of his head clean off, and then the same thing happened to the tailor  But their fear left them when, after he had finished his work, the old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a friendly manner, as much as to say, they had behaved well to let all that be done to them willingly, and without any struggle  He pointed with his finger to a heap of coals which lay at one side, and signified to the travelers by his gestures that they were to fill their pockets with them  Both of them obeyed, although they did not know of what use the coals would be to them, and then they went on their way to seek a shelter for the night  When they had got into the valley, the clock of the neighboring monastery struck twelve, and the song ceased  In a moment all had vanished, and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight  The two travelers found an inn, and covered themselves up on their straw-beds with their coats, but in their weariness forgot to take the coals out of them before doing so  A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual  They felt in the pockets, and could not believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with coals, but with pure gold  Happily, too, the hair of their heads and beards was there again as thick as ever  They had now become rich folks, but the goldsmith, who, in accordance with his greedy disposition, had filled his pockets better, was twice as rich as the tailor  A greedy man, even if he has much, still wishes to have more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they should wait another day, and go out again in the evening in order to bring back still greater treasures from the old man on the hill  The tailor refused, and said, I have enough and am content  Now I shall be a master, and marry my dear object - for so he called his sweetheart - and I am a happy man  But he stayed another day to please him  In the evening the goldsmith hung a couple of bags over his shoulders that he might be able to stow away a great deal, and took the road to the hill  He found, as on the night before, the little folks at their singing and dancing, and the old man again shaved him clean, and made signs to him to take some coal  He was not slow about stuffing as much into his bags as would go, went back quite delighted, and covered himself over with his coat There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant  He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one  One day he said to her, listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow  The woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating  Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd and said, look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried  The cow-herd said, all right, and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass  The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said, it will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already  At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf, if you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs', " I don't care to drag you home again in my arms", ' But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was  The cow-herd answered, it is still standing out there eating  It would not stop and come with us  But the little peasant said, oh, but I must have my beast back again  Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone  The cow-herd said, it must have run away', " The peasant, however, said, don't tell me that, and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away", ' And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed  They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds  On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin  But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter', " The miller's wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant, lay yourself on the straw there, and gave him a slice of bread and cheese", ' The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought, he is tired and has gone to sleep  In the meantime came the parson', " The miller's wife received him well, and said, my husband is out, so we will have a feast", ' The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese  Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine  Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside  The woman said, oh, heavens  It is my husband  She quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch The Lord God had created all animals, and had chosen out the wolf to be his dog, but he had forgotten the goat  Then the devil made ready and began to create also, and created goats with fine long tails  Now when they went to pasture, they generally remained caught in the hedges by their tails, whereupon the devil had to go and disentangle them, with a great deal of trouble  This enraged him at last, and he went and bit off the tail of every goat, as may be seen to this day by the stump  Then he let them go to pasture alone, but it came to pass that the Lord God perceived how at one time they gnawed away at a fruitful tree, at another injured the noble vines, or destroyed other tender plants  This distressed him, so that in his goodness and mercy he summoned his wolves, who soon tore in pieces the goats that went there  When the devil observed this, he went before the Lord and said, your creatures have destroyed mine  The Lord answered, why did you create things to do harm  The devil said, I was compelled to do it, inasmuch as my thoughts run on evil  What I create can have no other nature, and you must pay me heavy damages  I will pay you as soon as the oak leaves fall, come then, your money will then be ready counted out  When the oak-leaves had fallen, the devil came and demanded what was due to him  But the Lord said, in the church of constantinople stands a tall oaktree which still has all its leaves  With raging and curses, the devil departed, and went to seek the oak, wandered in the wilderness for six months before he found it, and when he returned, all the oaks had in the meantime covered themselves again with green leaves  Then he had to forfeit his indemnity, and in his rage he put out the eyes of all the remaining goats, and put his own in instead', " This is why all goats have devil's eyes, and their tails bitten off, and why he likes to assume their shape", '  A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell  Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself  At this the little flea began to scream loudly  Then said the little room-door, little flea, why are you screaming  Because the louse has burnt herself  Then the little door began to creak  At this a little broom in the corner said, why are you creaking, little door  Have I not reason to creak       The little louse has burnt herself,      the little flea is weeping  So the little broom began to sweep frantically  Then a little cart passed by and said, why are you sweeping, little broom  Have I not reason to sweep       The little louse has burnt herself,      the little flea is weeping,      the little door is creaking  So the little cart said, then I will run, and began to run like mad  Then said the ash-heap by which it ran, why are you running so, little cart  Have I not reason to run       The little louse has burnt herself,      the little flea is weeping,      the little door is creaking,      the little broom is sweeping  The ash-heap said, then I will burn furiously, and began to burn in clear flames  A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said, ash-heap, why are you burning  Have I not reason to burn       The little louse has burnt herself,      the little flea is weeping,      the little door is creaking,      the little broom is sweeping,      the little cart is running  The little tree said, then I will shake myself, and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off  A girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said, little tree, why are you shaking yourself  Have I not reason to shake myself       The little louse has burnt herself,      the little flea is weeping,      the little door is creaking,      the little broom is sweeping,      the little cart is running,      the little ash-heap is burning  At this the girl said, then I will break my little water-pitcher  And she broke her little water-pitcher  Then said the little spring from which ran the water, girl, why are you breaking your water-pitcher  Have I not reason to break my water-pitcher       The little louse has burnt herself,      the little flea is weeping,      the little door is creaking,      the little broom is sweeping,      the little cart is running,      the little ash-heap is burning,      the little tree is shaking itself A girl from brakel once went to St', " Anne's chapel at the foot of the hinnenberg, and as she wanted to have a husband, and thought there was no one else in the chapel, she sang,        oh, holy saint anne", '        Help me soon to a man', "        Thou know'st him right well,        by suttmer gate does he dwell,        his hair it is yellow,        thou know'st him right well", ' The clerk, however, was standing behind the altar and heard that, so he cried in a very gruff voice, you shall not have him  You shall not have him  The maiden thought that the child mary who stood by her mother anne had called out that to her, and was angry, and cried, fiddle de dee, conceited thing, hold your tongue, and let your mother speak   One day an old man and his wife were sitting in front of a miserable house resting a while from their work  Suddenly a splendid carriage with four black horses came driving up, and a richly-dressed man descended from it  The peasant stood up, went to the great man, and asked what he wanted, and in what way he could serve him  The stranger stretched out his hand to the old man, and said, I want nothing but to enjoy for once a country dish, cook me some potatoes, in the way you always have them, and then I will sit down at your table and eat them with pleasure  The peasant smiled and said, you are a count or a prince, or perhaps even a duke, noble gentlemen often have such fancies, but you shall have your wish  The wife then went into the kitchen and began to wash and rub the potatoes, and to make them into balls, as they are eaten by the country-folks  Whilst she was busy with this work, the peasant said to the stranger, come into my garden with me for a while, I have still something to do there  He had dug some holes in the garden, and now wanted to plant trees in them  Have you no children, asked the stranger, who could help you with your work  No, answered the peasant, I had a son, it is true, but it is long since he went out into the world', " He was a ne'er-do-well, clever and knowing, but he would learn nothing and was full of bad tricks", ' At last he ran away from me, and since then I have heard nothing of him  The old man took a young tree, put it in a hole, drove in a post beside it, and when he had shovelled in some earth and had trampled it firmly down, he tied the stem of the tree above, below, and in the middle, fast to the post by a rope of straw', " But tell me, said the stranger, why you don't tie that crooked knotted tree, which is lying in the corner there, bent down almost to the ground, to a post also that it may grow straight, as well as these", ' The old man smiled and said, sir, you speak according to your knowledge, it is easy to see that you are not familiar with gardening  That tree there is old, and mis-shapen, no one can make it straight now  Trees must be trained while they are young  That is how it was with your son, said the stranger, if you had trained him while he was still young, he would not have run away  Now he too must have grown hard and mis-shapen  Truly it is a long time since he went away, replied the old man, he must have changed  Would you know him again if he were to come to you, asked the stranger  Hardly by his face, replied the peasant, but he has a mark about him, a birth-mark on his shoulder, that looks like a bean  When he had said that the stranger pulled off his coat, bared his shoulder, and showed the peasant the bean  Good God, cried the old man, you are really my son, and love for his child stirred in his heart  But, he added, how can you be my son, you have become a great lord and live in wealth and luxury  How have you contrived to do that  Ah, father, answered the son, the young tree was bound to no post and has grown crooked  Now it is too old, it will never be straight again  How have I come by all this  I have become a thief, but do not be alarmed, I am a master-thief In days gone by there was a land where the nights were always dark, and the sky spread over it like a black cloth, for there the moon never rose, and no star shone in the gloom  At the creation of the world, the light at night had been sufficient  Three young fellows once went out of this country on a traveling expedition, and arrived in another kingdom, where, in the evening when the sun had disappeared behind the mountains, a shining globe was placed on an oak-tree, which shed a soft light far and wide  By means of this, everything could very well be seen and distinguished, even though it was not so brilliant as the sun  The travelers stopped and asked a countryman who was driving past with his cart, what kind of a light that was  That is the moon, answered he, our mayor bought it for three talers, and fastened it to the oak-tree  He has to pour oil into it daily, and to keep it clean, so that it may always burn clearly  He receives a taler a week from us for doing it  When the countryman had driven away, one of them said, we could make some use of this lamp, we have an oak-tree at home, which is just as big as this, and we could hang it on that  What a pleasure it would be not to have to feel about at night in the darkness', " I'll tell you what we'll do, said the second, we will fetch a cart and horses and carry away the moon", ' The people here may buy themselves another', " I'm a good climber, said the third, I will bring it down", ' The fourth brought a cart and horses, and the third climbed the tree, bored a hole in the moon, passed a rope through it, and let it down  When the shining ball lay in the cart, they covered it over with a cloth, that no one might observe the theft  They conveyed it safely into their own country, and placed it on a high oak  Old and young rejoiced, when the new lamp let its light shine over the whole land, and bed-rooms and sitting-rooms were filled with it  The dwarfs came forth from their caves in the rocks, and the tiny elves in their little red coats danced in rings on the meadows  The four took care that the moon was provided with oil, cleaned the wick, and received their weekly taler, but they became old men, and when one of them grew ill, and saw that he was about to die, he appointed that one quarter of the moon, should, as his property, be laid in the grave with him  When he died, the mayor climbed up the tree, and cut off a quarter with the hedge-shears, and this was placed in his coffin  The light of the moon decreased, but still not visibly  When the second died, the second quarter was buried with him, and the light diminished  It grew weaker still after the death of the third, who likewise took his part of it away with him, and when the fourth was borne to his grave, the old state of darkness recommenced, and whenever the people went out at night without their lanterns they knocked their heads together in collision  When, however, the pieces of the moon had united themselves together again in the world below, where darkness had always prevailed, it came to pass that the dead became restless and awoke from their sleep  They were astonished when they were able to see again, the moonlight was quite sufficient for them, for their eyes had become so weak that they could not have borne the brilliance of the sun  They rose up and were merry, and fell into their former ways of living  Some of them went to the play and to dance, others hastened to the public-houses, where they asked for wine, got drunk, brawled, quarreled, and at last took up cudgels, and belabored each other  The noise became greater and greater, and at last reached even to heaven  St  Peter, who guards the gate of heaven, thought the lower world had broken out in revolt and gathered together the heavenly hosts, which were employed to drive back the evil one when he and his associates storm the abode of the blessed Once upon a time a mouse, a bird, and a sausage became companions, kept house together, lived well and happily in peace, and wonderfully increased their possessions', " The bird's work was to fly every day into the forest and bring back wood", ' The mouse had to carry water, light the fire, and lay the table, but the sausage had to cook  He who is too well off is always longing for something new  One day the bird met with another bird, to whom it related its excellent circumstances and boasted of them  The other bird, however, called it a poor simpleton for his hard work, but said that the two at home had good times  For when the mouse had made her fire and carried her water, she went into her little room to rest until they called her to lay the table  The sausage stayed by the pot, saw that the food was cooking well, and, when it was nearly time for dinner, it rolled itself once or twice through the broth or vegetables and then they were buttered, salted, and ready  When the bird came home and laid his burden down, they sat down to dinner, and after they had had their meal, they slept their fill till next morning, and that was a splendid life  Next day the bird, prompted by the other bird, would go no more into the wood, saying that he had been servant long enough, and had been made a fool of by them, and that they must change about for once, and try to arrange it in another way  And, though the mouse and the sausage also begged most earnestly, the bird would have his way, and said it must be tried  They cast lots about it, and the lot fell on the sausage who was to carry wood, the mouse became cook, and the bird was to fetch water  What happened  The little sausage went out towards the wood, the little bird lighted the fire, the mouse stayed by the pot and waited alone until little sausage came home and brought wood for next day  But the little sausage stayed so long on the road that they both feared something was amiss, and the bird flew out a little way in the air to meet it  Not far off, however, it met a dog on the road who had fallen on the poor sausage as lawful booty, and had seized and swallowed it  The bird charged the dog with an act of bare-faced robbery, but words were useless, for the dog said he had found forged letters on the sausage, on which account its life was forfeited to him  The bird sadly took up the wood, flew home, and related what he had seen and heard  They were much troubled, but agreed to do their best and remain together  The bird therefore laid the table, and the mouse made ready the food, and wanted to dress it, and to get into the pot as the sausage used to do, and roll and creep amongst the vegetables to mix them  But before she got into the midst of them she was stopped, and lost her skin and hair and life in the attempt  When the bird came to carry in the dinner, no cook was there  In its distress the bird threw the wood here and there, called and searched, but no cook was to be found  Owing to his carelessness the wood caught fire, so that a conflagration broke out  The bird hastened to fetch water, but the bucket dropped into the well, and he fell in with it, and could not recover himself, but had to drown there   A merchant had done good business at the fair  He had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver  Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall  So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away  At noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said, a nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its near hind foot  Let it be wanting, answered the merchant  The shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go  I am in a hurry', " In the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said, sir, a shoe is missing from your horse's near hind foot", ' Shall I take him to the blacksmith  Let it be wanting, answered the man  The horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain  I am in haste  He rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp  It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg  The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot  And there he did not arrive until quite late at night  And that cursed nail, said he to himself, has caused all this disaster  The more haste the less speed   There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great contentment  They had money and land, and their prosperity increased year by year more and more  But ill luck comes like a thief in the night  As their wealth had increased so did it again decrease, year by year, and at last the miller could hardly call the mill in which he lived, his own', " He was in great distress, and when he lay down after his day's work, found no rest, but tossed about in his bed, sorely troubled", ' One morning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air, thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter  As he was stepping over the mill-dam the first sunbeam was just breaking forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond  He turned round and perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out of the water  Her long hair, which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands, fell down on both sides, and covered her white body  He soon saw that she was the nixie of the mill-pond, and in his fright did not know whether he should run away or stay where he was  But the nixie made her sweet voice heard, called him by his name, and asked him why he was so sad  The miller was at first struck dumb, but when he heard her speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he had formerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so poor that he did not know what to do  Be easy, answered the nixie, I will make you richer and happier than you have ever been before, only you must promise to give me the young thing which has just been born in your house  What else can that be, thought the miller, but a puppy or a kitten, and he promised her what she desired  The nixie descended into the water again, and he hurried back to his mill, consoled and in good spirits  He had not yet reached it, when the maid-servant came out of the house and cried to him to rejoice, for his wife had given birth to a little boy  The miller stood as if struck by lightning  He saw very well that the cunning nixie had been aware of it, and had cheated him', " Hanging his head, he went up to his wife's bedside and when she said, why do you not rejoice over the fine boy, he told her what had befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had given to the nixie", ' Of what use to me are riches and prosperity, he added, if I am to lose my child  But what can I do  Even the relatives, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not know what to say', " In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller's house", ' All that he undertook succeeded  It was as if presses and coffers filled themselves of their own accord, and as if money multiplied nightly in the cupboards  It was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before  But he could not rejoice over it untroubled, for the bargain which he had made with the nixie tormented his soul  Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared she might ascend and remind him of his debt  He never let the boy himself go near the water  Beware, he said to him, if you do but touch the water, a hand will rise, seize you, and draw you down There was once an old woman, but you have surely seen an old woman go a-begging before now  This woman begged likewise, and when she got anything she said, may God reward you  The beggar-woman came to a door, and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warming himself  The boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering thus by the door, come, old mother, and warm yourself  She came in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags began to burn, and she was not aware of it  The boy stood and saw that, but he ought to have put the flames out  Is it not true that he ought to have put them out  And if he had not any water, then he should have wept all the water in his body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied two pretty streams with which to extinguish them   There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth', " His son and his son's wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it", ' And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears  Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke  The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed  Then they bought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of which he had to eat  They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground  What are you doing there, asked the father  I am making a little trough, answered the child, for father and mother to eat out of when I am big  The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry  Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything   At the time when our Lord still walked this earth, he and St', " Peter stopped one evening at a smith's and received free quarters", ' Then it came to pass that a poor beggar, hard pressed by age and infirmity, came to this house and begged alms of the smith  St  Peter had compassion on him and said, Lord and master, if it please you, cure his torments that he may be able to win his own bread  The Lord said kindly, smith, lend me your forge, and put on some coals for me, and then I will make this ailing old man young again  The smith was quite willing, and St  Peter blew the bellows, and when the coal fire sparkled up large and high our Lord took the little old man, pushed him in the forge in the midst of the red-hot fire, so that he glowed like a rose-bush, and praised God with a loud voice  After that the Lord went to the quenching tub, put the glowing little man into it so that the water closed over him, and after he had carefully cooled him, gave him his blessing, when behold the little man sprang nimbly out, looking fresh, straight, healthy, and as if he were but twenty  The smith, who had watched everything closely and attentively, invited them all to supper  He, however, had an old half-blind crooked, mother-in-law who went to the youth, and with great earnestness asked if the fire had burnt him much  He answered that he had never felt more comfortable, and that he had sat in the red heat as if he had been in cool dew', " The youth's words echoed in the ears of the old woman all night long, and early next morning, when the Lord had gone on his way again and had heartily thanked the smith, the latter thought he might make his old mother-in-law young again likewise, as he had watched everything so carefully, and it lay in the province of his trade", ' So he called to ask her if she, too, would like to go bounding about like a girl of eighteen  She said, with all my heart, as the youth has come out of it so well  So the smith made a great fire, and thrust the old woman into it, and she writhed about this way and that, and uttered terrible cries of murder  Sit still  Why are you screaming and jumping about so, cried he, and as he spoke he blew the bellows again until all her rags were burnt  The old woman cried without ceasing, and the smith thought to himself, I have not quite the right art, and took her out and threw her into the cooling-tub', " Then she screamed so loudly that the smith's wife upstairs and her daughter-in-law heard it, and they both ran downstairs, and saw the old woman lying in a heap in the quenching-tub, howling and screaming, with her face wrinkled and shriveled and all out of shape", ' Thereupon the two, who were both with child, were so terrified that that very night two boys were born who were not made like men but apes, and they ran into the woods, and from them sprang the race of apes   A poor servant-girl was once traveling with the family with which she was in service, through a great forest, and when they were in the midst of it, robbers came out of the thicket, and murdered all they found  All perished together except the girl, who had jumped out of the carriage in a fright, and hidden herself behind a tree  When the robbers had gone away with their booty, she came out and beheld the great disaster  Then she began to weep bitterly, and said, "What can a poor girl like me do now? I do not know how to get out of the forest, no human being lives in it, so I must certainly starve " She walked about and looked for a road, but could find none', " When it was evening she seated herself under a tree, gave herself into God's keeping, and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away, let happen what might", ' When she had sat there for a while, a white dove came flying to her with a little golden key in its beak  It put the little key in her hand, and said, "Do you see that great tree, therein is a little lock, open it with the tiny key, and you will find food enough, and suffer no more hunger " Then she went to the tree and opened it, and found milk in a little dish, and white bread to break into it, so that she could eat her fill  When she was satisfied, she said, "It is now the time when the hens at home go to roost, I am so tired I could go to bed too " Then the dove flew to her again, and brought another golden key in its bill, and said, "Open that tree there, and you will find a bed " So she opened it, and found a beautiful white bed, and she prayed God to protect her during the night, and lay down and slept  In the morning the dove came for the third time, and again brought a little key, and said, "Open that tree there, and you will find clothes " And when she opened it, she found garments beset with gold and with jewels, more splendid than those of any king\'s daughter  So she lived there for some time, and the dove came every day and provided her with all she needed, and it was a quiet good life  Then one day the dove came and said, "Will you do something for my sake?" "With all my heart," said the girl  Then said the little dove, "I will guide you to a small house, enter it and inside it, an old woman will be sitting by the fire and will say, \'good-day', "' But on your life give her no answer, let her do what she will, but pass by her on the right side", ' Further on, there is a door, which open, and you will enter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds are lying, amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining stones  Leave them, however, where they are, and seek out a plain one, which must likewise be amongst them, and bring it here to me as quickly as you can " The girl went to the little house, and came to the door  There sat an old woman who stared when she saw her, and said, "Good-day my child " The girl gave her no answer, and opened the door  "Whither away?" cried the old woman, and seized her by the gown, and wanted to hold her fast, saying, "That is my house, no one can go in there if I choose not to allow it " But the girl was silent, got away from her, and went straight into the room  Now there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings, which gleamed and glittered before her eyes  She turned them over and looked for the plain one, but could not find it  While she was seeking, she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and wanting to go off with a bird-cage which she had in her hand  So she went after her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised it up and looked into it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring in its bill  Then she took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and thought the little white dove would come and get the ring, but it did not Two or three hundred years ago, when people were far from being so crafty and cunning as they are nowadays, an extraordinary event took place in a little town  By some mischance one of the great owls, called horned owls, had come from the neighboring woods into the barn of one of the townsfolk in the night-time, and when day broke did not dare to venture forth again from her retreat, for fear of the other birds, which raised a terrible outcry whenever she appeared  In the morning when the man-servant went into the barn to fetch some straw, he was so mightily alarmed at the sight of the owl sitting there in a corner, that he ran away and announced to his master that a monster, the like of which he had never set eyes on in his life, and which could devour a man without the slightest difficulty, was sitting in the barn, rolling its eyes about in its head  I know your kind, said the master, you have courage enough to chase a blackbird about the fields, but when you see a hen lying dead, you have to get a stick before you go near it  I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster it is, added the master, and went quite boldly into the granary and looked round him  When, however, he saw with his own eyes the strange grim creature, he was no less terrified than the servant had been  With two bounds he sprang out, ran to his neighbours, and begged them imploringly to lend him assistance against an unknown and dangerous beast, or else the whole town might be in danger if it were to break loose out of the barn, where it was shut up  A great noise and clamor arose in all the streets, the townsmen came armed with spears, hay-forks, scythes, and axes, as if they were going out against an enemy  Finally, the senators appeared with the burgomaster at their head  When they had drawn up in the market-place, they marched to the barn, and surrounded it on all sides  Thereupon one of the most courageous of them stepped forth and entered with his spear lowered, but came running out immediately afterwards with a shriek and as pale as death, and could not utter a single word  Yet two others ventured in, but they fared no better  At last one stepped forth, a great strong man who was famous for his warlike deeds, and said, you will not drive away the monster by merely looking at him, we must be in earnest here, but I see that you have all tuned into women, and not one of you dares to encounter the animal  He ordered them to give him some armor, had a sword and spear brought, and armed himself  All praised his courage, though many feared for his life  The two barn-doors were opened, and they saw the owl, which in the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great cross-beam  He had a ladder brought, and when he raised it, and made ready to climb up, they all cried out to him that he was to bear himself bravely, and commended him to St  George, who slew the dragon  When he had just got to the top, and the owl perceived that he had designs on her, and was also bewildered by the crowd and the shouting, and knew not how to escape, she rolled her eyes, ruffled her feathers, flapped her wings, snapped her beak, and cried, tuwhit, tuwhoo, in a harsh voice  Strike home  Strike home  Screamed the crowd outside to the valiant hero  Any one who was standing where I am standing, answered he, would not cry, strike home  He certainly did plant his foot one rung higher on the ladder, but then he began to tremble, and half-fainting, went back again  And now there was no one left who dared to place himself in such danger  The monster, said they, has poisoned and mortally wounded the very strongest man among us, by snapping at him and just breathing on him  Are we, too, to risk our lives  They took counsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town from being destroyed  For a long time everything seemed to be of no use, but at length the burgomaster found an expedient  My opinion, said he, is that we ought, out of the common purse, to pay for this barn, and whatsoever corn, straw, or hay it contains, and thus indemnify the owner, and then burn down the whole building and the terrible beast with it The cock once said to the hen, it is now the time when the nuts are ripe, so let us go to the hill together and for once eat our fill before the squirrel takes them all away  Yes, replied the hen, come, we will have some fun together  Then they went away to the hill, and as it was a bright day they stayed till evening  Now I do not know whether it was that they had eaten till they were too fat, or whether they had become too proud, but they would not go home on foot, and the cock had to build a little carriage of nut-shells  When it was ready, the little hen seated herself in it and said to the cock, you can just harness yourself to it  I like that  Said the cock  I would rather go home on foot than let myself be harnessed to it  No, that is not our bargain  I do not mind being coachman and sitting on the box, but drag it myself I will not  As they were thus disputing, a duck quacked at them, you thieving folks, who bade you go to my nut-hill  Wait, you shall suffer for it, and ran with open beak at the cock  But the cock also was not idle, and fell boldly on the duck, and at last wounded her so with his spurs that she begged for mercy, and willingly let herself be harnessed to the carriage as a punishment  The little cock now seated himself on the box and was coachman, and thereupon they went off at a gallop, with the cock crying, duck, go as fast as you can  When they had driven a part of the way they met two foot-passengers, a pin and a needle  They cried, stop  Stop  And said that it would soon be as dark as pitch, and then they could not go a step further, and that it was so dirty on the road, and asked if they could not get into the carriage for a while', " They had been at the tailor's public-house by the gate, and had stayed too long over the beer", ' As they were thin people, who did not take up much room, the cock let them both get in, but they had to promise him and his little hen not to step on their feet  Late in the evening they came to an inn, and as they did not like to go further by night, and as the duck also was not strong on her feet, and fell from one side to the other, they went in  The host at first made many objections, his house was already full, besides he thought they could not be very distinguished persons  But at last, as they made pleasant speeches, and told him that he should have the egg which the little hen had laid on the way, and should likewise keep the duck, which laid one every day, he at length said that they might stay the night  And now they had themselves well served, and feasted and had a high good time  Early in the morning, when day was breaking and every one was asleep, the cock awoke the hen, brought the egg, pecked it open, and they ate it together, but they threw the shell on the hearth', " Then they went to the needle which was still asleep, took it by the head and stuck it into the cushion of the landlord's chair, and put the pin in his towel, and at last without more ado they fled away over the heath", ' The duck who liked to sleep in the open air and had stayed in the yard, heard them going away, made herself merry and found a stream, down which she swam, which was a much quicker way of traveling than being harnessed to a carriage  The host did not get out of bed until a couple of hours later  He washed himself and was about to dry himself, when the pin went over his face and made a red scratch from one ear to the other  After this he went into the kitchen and wanted to light a pipe, but when he came to the hearth the egg-shell darted into his eyes There was once upon a time a far-sighted, crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about  The best story, however, is how he once got hold of the devil, and made a fool of him  The peasant had one day been working in his field, and as twilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field, and when, full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil was sitting on the live coals  Are you sitting upon a treasure, said the peasant  Yes, in truth, replied the devil, on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than you have ever seen in your life  The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me, said the peasant  It is yours, answered the devil, if you will for two years give me one half of everything your field produces  Money I have enough, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth  The peasant agreed to the bargain  In order, however, that no dispute may arise about the division, said he, everything that is above ground shall belong to you, and what is under the earth to me  The devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had sown turnips  Now when the time for harvest came, the devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop  But he found nothing but the yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight, was digging up his turnips', " You have had the best of it for once, said the devil, but the next time that won't do", ' What grows above ground shall be yours, and what is under it, mine  I am willing, replied the peasant  But when the time came to sow, he did not again sow turnips, but wheat  The grain became ripe, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks down to the ground  When the devil came, he found nothing but the stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the rocks  That is the way to cheat the devil, said the peasant, and went and fetched away the treasure   Once upon a time a poor pious peasant died, and arrived before the gate of heaven  At the same time a very rich, rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven  Then saint peter came with the key, and opened the door, and let the great man in, but apparently did not see the peasant, and shut the door again  And now the peasant outside heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing, and how they were making music, and singing within  At length all became quiet again, and saint peter came and opened the gate of heaven, and let the peasant in  The peasant, however, expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also, but all remained quite quiet  He was received with great affection, it is true, and the angels came to meet him, but no one sang  Then the peasant asked saint peter how it was that they did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man went in, and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven things were done with just as much partiality as on earth  Then said saint peter, by no means, you are just as dear to us as anyone else, and will enjoy every heavenly delight that the rich man enjoys, but poor fellows like you come to heaven every day, but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a hundred years   There was once a poor peasant who had no land, but only a small house, and one daughter  Then said the daughter, we ought to ask our lord the king for a bit of newly-cleared land  When the king heard of their poverty, he presented them with a piece of land, which she and her father dug up, and intended to sow with a little corn and grain of that kind  When they had dug nearly the whole of the field, they found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold  Listen, said the father to the girl, as our lord the king has been so gracious and presented us with the field, we ought to give him this mortar in return for it  The daughter, however, would not consent to this, and said, father, if we have the mortar without having the pestle as well, we shall have to get the pestle, so you had much better say nothing about it  But he would not obey her, and took the mortar and carried it to the king, said that he had found it in the cleared land, and asked if he would accept it as a present  The king took the mortar, and asked if he had found nothing besides that  No, answered the countryman  Then the king said that he must now bring him the pestle  The peasant said they had not found that, but he might just as well have spoken to the wind, he was put in prison, and was to stay there until he produced the pestle  The servants had daily to carry him bread and water, which is what people get in prison, and they heard how the man cried out continually, ah, if I had but listened to my daughter  Alas, alas, if I had but listened to my daughter, and would neither eat nor drink  So he commanded the servants to bring the prisoner before him, and then the king asked the peasant why he was always crying, ah, if I had but listened to my daughter, and what it was that his daughter had said  She told me that I ought not to take the mortar to you, for I should have to produce the pestle as well  If you have a daughter who is as wise as that, let her come here  She was therefore obliged to appear before the king, who asked her if she really was so wise, and said he would set her a riddle, and if she could guess that, he would marry her  She at once said yes, she would guess it  Then said the king, come to me not clothed, not naked, not riding, not walking, not in the road, and not off the road, and if you can do that I will marry you', " So she went away, put off everything she had on, and then she was not clothed, and took a great fishing net, and seated herself in it and wrapped it entirely round and round her, so that she was not naked, and she hired an ass, and tied the fisherman's net to its tail, so that it was forced to drag her along, and that was neither riding nor walking", ' The ass had also to drag her in the ruts, so that she only touched the ground with her big toe, and that was neither being in the road nor off the road  And when she arrived in that fashion, the king said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the conditions  Then he ordered her father to be released from the prison, took her to wife, and gave into her care all the royal possessions  Now when some years had passed, the king was once reviewing his troops on parade, when it happened that some peasants who had been selling wood stopped with their waggons before the palace, some of them had oxen yoked to them, and some horses  There was one peasant who had three horses, one of which was delivered of a young foal, and it ran away and lay down between two oxen which were in front of the waggon  When the peasants came together, they began to dispute, to beat each other and make a disturbance, and the peasant with the oxen wanted to keep the foal, and said one of the oxen had given birth to it, and the other said his horse had had it, and that it was his  The quarrel came before the king, and he give the verdict that the foal should stay where it had been found, and so the peasant with the oxen, to whom it did not belong, got it  Then the other went away, and wept and lamented over his foal  Now he had heard how gracious his lady the queen was because she herself had sprung from poor peasant folks, so he went to her and begged her to see if she could not help him to get his foal back again  Said she, yes, I will tell you what to do, if you will promise me not to betray me There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children  Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter  Then an angel from heaven came to her and said, be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have  Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness  Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream  It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep', " Then came the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen's apron and on her dress", ' Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts  When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen, and had his wife put into it, and walled up  Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger  But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over  The cook, however, thought to himself, if the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble  So he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak, and said to him, wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with a garden, and all else that pertains to it', " Scarcely were the words out of the boy's mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for", ' After a while the cook said to him, it is not well for you to be so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion', " Then the king's son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her", ' The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman', " The thought occurred to him, however, that the king's son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril", ' So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said, to-night when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life  Thereupon he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said, why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone  The cook once more said, if you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life  When he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy, lie down in your bed, and draw the clothes over you', " Then the wicked wretch came in and said, where are the boy's heart and tongue", " The girl reached the plate to him, but the king's son threw off the quilt, and said, you old sinner, why did you want to kill me", ' Now will I pronounce thy sentence  You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat  And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat', " The king's son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still alive", ' At length he said to the maiden, I will go home to my own country, if you will go with me, I will provide for you  Ah, she replied, the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother were dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house of a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up  The man and his wife, however, had bad hearts, and were greedy and jealous of their riches, and vexed whenever anyone put a morsel of their bread in his mouth  The poor young fellow might do what he liked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more  One day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she escaped through a hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly, and carried her off through the air  The boy called, thief, thief, rascal, with all the strength of his body  But what good did that do  The hawk did not bring its prey back again  The man heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days  Then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his difficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there  He thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them all together with a string, because then the hawk would not be able to steal any of them away from him  But he was very much mistaken  After two days, worn out with running about and hunger, he fell asleep  The bird of prey came, and seized one of the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it carried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and devoured them  The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw the misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully that he was forced to lie in bed for several days  When he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, you are too stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of you, you must go as errand-boy  Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as well  On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two grapes  He took the basket to the judge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the grapes he said, two are missing  The boy confessed quite honestly that, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which were missing  The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked for the same number of grapes again  These also the boy had to take to him with a letter  As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two grapes  But first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a stone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might not see and betray him  The judge, however, again made him give an explanation about the missing grapes  Ah, said the boy, how have you learnt that  The letter could not know about it, for I put it under a stone before I did it', " The judge could not help laughing at the boy's simplicity, and sent the man a letter wherein he cautioned him to look after the poor boy better, and not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to teach him what was right and what was wrong", ' I will soon show you the difference, said the hard man, if you will eat, you must work, and if you do anything wrong, you shall be quite sufficiently taught by blows  The next day he set him a hard task  He was to chop two bundles of hay for food for the horses, and then the man threatened, in five hours, said he, I shall be back again, and if the hay is not chopped by that time, I will beat you until you can not move a limb In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn  Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other, the one large and beautiful, the other small and poor  The large one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor man  Then the Lord thought, I shall be no burden to the rich man  I will stay the night with him  Then the rich man heard someone knocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger what he wanted', " The Lord answered, I only ask for a night's lodging", ' Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, no, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds  And if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself  Go somewhere else for a lodging, and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there  So the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across to the small house and knocked  He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in  Pass the night with me, it is already dark, said he  You cannot go any further to-night  This pleased the Lord, and he went in', " The poor man's wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got", ' They had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts  Then she put the potatoes on the fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat, that they might have a little milk with them  When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table  When they had had supper and it was bed-time, the woman called her husband apart and said, listen, dear husband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night, and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a good rest, for he has been walking the whole day through, and that makes one weary  With all my heart, he answered, I will go and offer it to him  And he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly  But the Lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks  However, they would not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay down in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground  Next morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a breakfast as they could for the guest  When the sun shone in through the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again ate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey  But as he was standing at the door he turned round and said, as you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for yourselves and I will grant them  Then the man said, what else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread  For the third wish, I do not know what to have  And the Lord said to him, will you wish for a new house instead of this old one In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child, and three apprentices served under him  As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, "I am old, and want to sit behind the stove  Go out, and whichsoever of you brings me the best horse home, to him will I give the mill, and in return for it he shall take care of me till my death " The third of the boys, however, was the dunce, who was looked on as foolish by the others, they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not even have it  Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, "You may just as well stay here, as long as you live you will never get a horse " Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep  The two smart ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was  And they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them  When the sun rose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern  He looked around on every side and exclaimed, "Oh, heavens, where am I?" Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, "Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?" Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, "Hans, where are you going?" "Alas, you can not help me " "I well know your desire," said the cat  "You wish to have a beautiful horse  Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years long, and then I will give you one more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life " "Well, this is a strange cat," thought Hans, "But I am determined to see if she is telling the truth " So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were nothing but kittens who were her servants  They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy  In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music  One played the bass viol, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could  When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, "Now, Hans, come and dance with me " "No," said he, "I won\'t dance with a pussy cat  I have never done that yet " "Then take him to bed," said she to the cats  So one of them lighted him to his bed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle  Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with her tail  "That feels very soft," said Hans  He, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and to do that, he had an axe of silver, and the wedge and saw were of silver and the mallet of copper  So he chopped the wood small, stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw anyone but the tabby-cat and her servants  Once she said to him, "Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass," and gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him deliver them up again carefully  So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and when he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give him his reward  "No," said the cat, "you must first do something more for me of the same kind' ,  "Two kings' sons once went out in search of adventures, and fell into a wild, disorderly way of living, so that they never came home again", ' The youngest, who was called simpleton, set out to seek his brothers, but when at length he found them they mocked him for thinking that he with his simplicity could get through the world, when they two could not make their way, and yet were so much cleverer  They all three traveled away together, and came to an ant-hill  The two elder wanted to destroy it, to see the little ants creeping about in their terror, and carrying their eggs away, but simpleton said, leave the creatures in peace, I will not allow you to disturb them  Then they went onwards and came to a lake, on which a great number of ducks were swimming  The two brothers wanted to catch a couple and roast them, but simpleton would not permit it, and said, leave the creatures in peace, I will not suffer you to kill them', " At length they came to a bee's nest, in which there was so much honey that it ran out of the trunk of the tree where it was", ' The two wanted to make a fire beneath the tree, and suffocate the bees in order to take away the honey, but simpleton again stopped them and said, leave the creatures in peace, I will not allow you to burn them  At length the three brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses were standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen, and they went through all the halls until, quite at the end, they came to a door in which were three locks  In the middle of the door, however, there was a little pane, through which they could see into the room  There they saw a little grey man, who was sitting at a table  They called him, once, twice, but he did not hear, at last they called him for the third time, when he got up, opened the locks, and came out  He said nothing, however, but conducted them to a handsomely-spread table, and when they had eaten and drunk, he took each of them to a bedroom  Next morning the little grey man came to the eldest, beckoned to him, and conducted him to a stone table, on which were inscribed three tasks, by the performance of which the castle could be delivered from enchantment', " The first was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the princess's pearls, a thousand in number, which must be picked up, and if by sunset one single pearl was missing, he who had looked for them would be turned into stone", ' The eldest went thither, and sought the whole day, but when it came to an end, he had only found one hundred, and what was written on the table came true, and he was turned into stone  Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure, but it did not fare much better with him than with the eldest, he did not find more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone', " At last it was simpleton's turn to seek in the moss, but it was so difficult for him to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated himself on a stone, and wept", ' And while he was thus sitting, the king of the ants whose life he had once saved, came with five thousand ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the pearls together, and laid them in a heap', " The second task, however, was to fetch out of the lake the key of the king's daughter's bed-chamber", ' When simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he had saved, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of the water  But the third task was the most difficult, from amongst the three sleeping daughters of the king was the youngest and dearest to be sought out  They, however, resembled each other exactly, and were only to be distinguished by their having eaten different sweetmeats before they fell asleep, the eldest a bit of sugar, the second a little syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey', " Then the queen of the bees, whom simpleton had protected from the fire, came and tasted the lips of all three, and at last she remained sitting on the mouth which had eaten honey, and thus the king's son recognized the right princess", ' Then the enchantment was at an end, everything was delivered from sleep, and those who had been turned to stone received once more their natural forms', " Simpleton married the youngest and sweetest princess, and after her father's death became king, and his two brothers received the two other sisters", '  There was once upon a time a queen who had a little daughter who was still so young that she had to be carried  One day the child was naughty, and the mother might say what she liked, but the child would not be quiet  Then she became impatient, and as the ravens were flying about the palace, she opened the window and said, I wish you were a raven and would fly away, and then I should have some rest  Scarcely had she spoken the words, before the child was changed into a raven, and flew from her arms out of the window  It flew into a dark forest, and stayed in it a long time, and the parents heard nothing of their child', " Then one day a man was on his way through this forest and heard the raven crying, and followed the voice, and when he came nearer, the bird said, I am a king's daughter by birth, and am bewitched, but you can set me free", ' What am I to do, asked he  She said, go further into the forest, and you will find a house, wherein sits an aged woman, who will offer you meat and drink, but you must accept nothing, for if you eat and drink anything, you will fall into a sleep, and then you will not be able to set me free  In the garden behind the house there is a great heap of tan, and on this you shall stand and wait for me', " For three days I will come every afternoon at two o'clock in a carriage", ' On the first day four white horses will be harnessed to it, then four chestnut horses, and lastly four black ones, but if you are not awake, but sleeping, I shall not be set free  The man promised to do everything that she desired, but the raven said, alas, I know already that you will not set me free, you will accept something from the woman  Then the man once more promised that he would certainly not touch anything either to eat or to drink  But when he entered the house the old woman came to him and said, poor man, how faint you are, come and refresh yourself, eat and drink  No, said the man, I will not eat or drink  She, however, let him have no peace, and said, if you will not eat, take one drink out of the glass, one is nothing  Then he let himself be persuaded, and drank', " Shortly before two o'clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven", ' As he was standing there, his weariness all at once became so great that he could not struggle against it, and lay down for a short time, but he was determined not to go to sleep  Hardly, however, had he lain down, than his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell asleep and slept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him', " At two o'clock the raven came driving up with four white horses, but she was already in deep grief and said, I know he is asleep", ' And when she came into the garden, he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap of tan  She alighted from the carriage, went to him, shook him, and called him, but he did not awake  Next day about noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and drink, but he would not take any of it  But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass', " Towards two o'clock he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven, but all at once felt such a great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him", ' He could not help himself, and was forced to lie down, and fell into a heavy sleep  When the raven drove up with four brown horses, she was already full of grief, and said, I know he is asleep  She went to him, but there he lay sleeping, and there was no wakening him  Next day the old woman asked what was the meaning of this' ,  "There was once a king's son who was seized with a desire to travel about the world, and took no one with him but a faithful servant", ' One day he came to a great forest, and when darkness overtook him he could find no shelter, and knew not where to pass the night  Then he saw a girl who was going towards a small house, and when he came nearer, he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful  He spoke to her, and said, dear child, can I and my servant find shelter for the night in the little house  Oh, yes, said the girl in a sad voice, that you certainly can, but I do not advise you to venture it  Do not go in', " Why not, asked the king's son", ' The maiden sighed and said, my step-mother practises wicked arts  She is ill-disposed toward strangers  Then he saw very well that he had come to the house of a witch, but as it was dark, and he could not go farther, and also was not afraid, he entered  The old woman was sitting in an armchair by the fire, and looked at the stranger with her red eyes  Good evening, growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly  Take a seat and rest yourselves  She fanned the fire on which she was cooking something in a small pot  The daughter warned the two to be prudent, to eat nothing, and drink nothing, for the old woman brewed evil drinks  They slept quietly until early morning', " When they were making ready for their departure, and the king's son was already seated on his horse, the old woman said, stop a moment, I will first hand you a parting draught", " Whilst she fetched it, the king's son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle his saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch came with the drink", ' Take that to your master, said she  But at that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the horse, and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down dead  The servant ran after his master and told him what had happened, but as he did not want to leave his saddle behind, he ran back to fetch it  When he came to the dead horse, however, a raven was already sitting on it devouring it  Who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day, said the servant  So he killed the raven, and took it with him  And now they journeyed onwards into the forest the whole day, but could not get out of it  By nightfall they found an inn and entered it  The servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to prepare for supper  They had stumbled, however, on a den of murderers, and during the darkness twelve of these came, intending to kill the strangers and rob them  But before they set about this work, they sat down to supper, and the innkeeper and the witch sat down with them, and together they ate a dish of soup in which was cut up the flesh of the raven  Hardly had they swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had communicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh There was once upon a time a miller, who had a beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he wished that she was provided for, and well married  He thought, if any good suitor comes and asks for her, I will give her to him  Not long afterwards, a suitor came, who appeared to be very rich, and as the miller had no fault to find with him, he promised his daughter to him  The maiden, however, did not like him quite so much as a girl should like the man to whom she is engaged, and had no confidence in him  Whenever she saw, or thought of him, she felt a secret horror  Once he said to her, you are my betrothed, and yet you have never once paid me a visit  The maiden replied, I know not where your house is  Then said the bridegroom, my house is out there in the dark forest  She tried to excuse herself and said she could not find the way there  The bridegroom said, next sunday you must come out there to me, I have already invited the guests, and I will strew ashes in order that you may find your way through the forest  When sunday came, and the maiden had to set out on her way, she became very uneasy, she herself knew not exactly why, and to mark her way she filled both her pockets full of peas and lentils  Ashes were strewn at the entrance of the forest, and these she followed, but at every step she threw a couple of peas on the ground  She walked almost the whole day until she reached the middle of the forest, where it was the darkest, and there stood a solitary house, which she did not like, for it looked so dark and dismal  She went inside it, but no one was within, and the most absolute stillness reigned', " Suddenly a voice cried, \tturn back, turn back, young maiden dear, \t'tis a murderer's house you enter here", ' The maiden looked up, and saw that the voice came from a bird, which was hanging in a cage on the wall', " Again it cried, \tturn back, turn back, young maiden dear, \t'tis a murderer's house you enter here", ' Then the young maiden went on farther from one room to another, and walked through the whole house, but it was entirely empty and not one human being was to be found  At last she came to the the cellar, and there sat an extremely aged woman, whose head shook constantly  Can you not tell me, said the maiden, if my betrothed lives here  Alas, poor child, replied the old woman, whither have you come', " You are in a murderer's den", ' You think you are a bride soon to be married, but you will keep your wedding with death  Look, I have been forced to put a great kettle on there, with water in it, and when they have you in their power, they will cut you to pieces without mercy, will cook you, and eat you, for they are eaters of human flesh  If I do not have compassion on you, and save you, you are lost  Thereupon the old woman led her behind a great hogshead where she could not be seen  Be still as a mouse, said she, do not make a sound, or move, or all will be over with you  At night, when the robbers are asleep, we will escape, I have long waited for an opportunity  Hardly was this done, than the godless crew came home  They dragged with them another young girl There was once a poor woman who had two children  The youngest had to go every day into the forest to fetch wood  Once when she had gone a long way to seek it, a little child, who was quite strong, came and helped her industriously to pick up the wood and carry it home, and then before a moment had passed the strange child disappeared  The child told her mother this, but at first she would not believe it  At length she brought a rose home, and told her mother that the beautiful child had given her this rose, and had told her that when it was in full bloom, he would return  The mother put the rose in water  One morning her child could not get out of bed  The mother went to the bed and found her dead, but she lay looking very happy  On the same morning, the rose was in full bloom   There was once upon a time a princess, who, high under the battlements in her castle, had an apartment with twelve windows, which looked out in every possible direction, and when she climbed up to it and looked around her, she could inspect her whole kingdom  When she looked out of the first, her sight was more keen than that of any other human being, from the second she could see still better, from the third more distinctly still, and so it went on, until the twelfth, from which she saw everything above the earth and under the earth, and nothing at all could be kept secret from her  Moreover, as she was haughty, and would be subject to no one, but wished to keep the dominion for herself alone, she caused it to be proclaimed that no one should ever be her husband who could not conceal himself from her so effectively, that it should be quite impossible for her to find him  He who tried this, however, and was discovered by her, was to have his head struck off, and stuck on a post  Ninety-seven posts with the heads of dead men were already standing before the castle, and no one had come forward for a long time  The princess was delighted, and thought to herself, now I shall be free as long as I live  Then three brothers appeared before her, and announced to her that they were desirous of trying their luck  The eldest believed he would be quite safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw him from the first window, made him come out, and had his head cut off  The second crept into the cellar of the palace, but she perceived him also from the first window, and his fate was sealed  His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post  Then the youngest came to her and entreated her to give him a day for consideration, and also to be so gracious as to overlook it if she should happen to discover him twice, but if he failed the third time, he would look on his life as over  As he was so handsome, and begged so earnestly, she said, yes, I will grant you that, but you will not succeed  Next day he meditated for a long time how he should hide himself, but all in vain  Then he seized his gun and went out hunting', " He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just going to fire, when the bird cried, don't shoot, I will reward you", ' He put his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he surprised a large fish which had come up from the depths below to the surface of the water', " When he had aimed at it, the fish cried, don't shoot, and I will reward you", ' He allowed it to dive down again, went onwards, and met a fox which was lame  He fired and missed it, and the fox cried, you had much better come here and draw the thorn out of my foot for me  He did this, but when he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the fox said, stop, and I will reward you  The youth let him go, and then as it was evening, returned home  Next day he was to hide himself, but no matter how he puzzled his brains over it, he did not know where', " He went into the forest to the raven and said, I let you live on, so now tell me where I am to hide myself, so that the king's daughter will not see me", ' The raven hung his head and thought it over for a long time  At length he croaked, I have it  He fetched an egg out of his nest, cut it into two parts, and shut the youth inside it, then made it whole again, and seated himself on it', " When the king's daughter went to the first window she could not discover him, nor could she from the others, and she began to be uneasy, but from the eleventh she saw him", ' She ordered the raven to be shot, and the egg to be brought and broken, and the youth was forced to come out  She said, for once you are excused, but if you do not better than this, you are lost', " Next day he went to the lake, called the fish to him and said, I suffered you to live, now tell me where to hide myself so that the king's daughter may not see me" ,  'There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had no daughter, however much he wished for one  At length his wife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into the world it was a girl  The joy was great, but the child was sickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of its weakness  The father sent one of the boys in haste to the spring to fetch water for the baptism  The other six went with him, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug fell into the well  There they stood and did not know what to do, and none of them dared to go home  As they still did not return, the father grew impatient, and said, they have certainly forgotten it while playing some game, the wicked boys  He became afraid that the girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his anger cried, I wish the boys were all turned into ravens  Hardly was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his head, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away  The parents could not withdraw the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent comforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day became more beautiful  For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were careful not to mention them before her, but one day she accidentally heard some people saying of herself, that the girl was certainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the misfortune which had befallen her seven brothers  Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what had become of them  The parents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what had befallen her brothers was the will of heaven, and that her birth had only been the innocent cause  But the maiden took it to heart daily, and thought she must save her brothers  She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to search for her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might  She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness  And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world  Then she came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and devoured little children  Hastily she ran away, and ran to the moon, but it was far too cold, and also awful and malicious, and when it saw the child, it said, I smell, I smell the flesh of men  At this she ran swiftly away, and came to the stars, which were kind and good to her, and each of them sat on its own particular little chair  But the morning star arose, and gave her the drumstick of a chicken, and said, if you have not that drumstick you can not open the glass mountain, and in the glass mountain are your brothers  The maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth, and went onwards again until she came to the glass mountain  The door was shut, and she thought she would take out the drumstick', " But when she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the good star's present", ' What was she now to do  She wished to rescue her brothers, and had no key to the glass mountain  The good sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it in the door, and succeeded in opening it  When she had gone inside, a little dwarf came to meet her, who said, my child, what are you looking for  I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens, she replied  The dwarf said, the lord ravens are not at home, but if you will wait here until they come, step in Seven swabians were once together  The first was master schulz, the second, jackli, the third, marli, the fourth, jergli, the fifth, michal, the sixth, Hans, the seventh, veitli  All seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures and perform great deeds  But in order that they might go in safety and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them  This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once  In front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was master schulz  All the others followed in a row, and veitli was the last  Then it came to pass one day in the hay month, when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner  Master schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold sweat broke out over his whole body  Hark, hark, cried he to his comrades, good heavens  I hear a drum  Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and into whose nose some smell had risen, said, something is most certainly going on, for I smell the powder and the match  At these words master schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow  O dear  O dear, screamed master schulz  Take me prisoner, I surrender, I surrender  The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, if you surrender, I surrender too  If you surrender, I surrender too  At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them should speak of it by mistake  Then they journeyed onwards  The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first  Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun  Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open  All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do  For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole  So they said, we must go through a great and dangerous struggle  Boldly ventured, is half won, and all seven grasped the spear, master schulz in front, and veitli behind', " Master schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried,      strike home, in every swabian's name,      or else I wish you may be lame", " But Hans knew how to meet this, and said,      thunder and lightning, it's fine to prate,      but for dragon-hunting you are always late", ' Michal cried,      nothing is missing, not even a hair,      be sure the devil himself is there There was once upon a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question  The king of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy  Then he said to him, if you can give me an answer to three questions which I will ask you, I will look on you as my own child, and you shall dwell with me in my royal palace  The boy said, what are the three questions  The king said, the first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean  The shepherd boy answered, lord king, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea  The king said, the next question is, how many stars are there in the sky  The shepherd boy said, give me a great sheet of white paper, and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them, any one who looked at them would have lost his sight  Then he said, there are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper  Just count them  But no one was able to do it  The king said, the third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity  Then said the shepherd boy, in lower pomerania is the diamond mountain, which is two miles high, two miles wide, and two miles deep  Every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over  The king said, you have answered the three questions like a wise man, and shall henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard you as my own child   There was once upon a time a king who had twelve daughters, each one more beautiful than the other  They all slept together in one chamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when they were in them the king locked the door, and bolted it  But in the morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to pass  Then the king caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and be king after his death, but that whosoever came forward and had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have forfeited his life', " It was not long before a king's son presented himself, and offered to undertake the enterprise", ' He was well received, and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses, sleeping-chamber  His bed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and danced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place, the door of their room was left open  But the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles  On the second and third nights there was no difference, and then his head was struck off without mercy  Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives  Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the king lived  There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going  "I hardly know myself," answered he, and added in jest, "I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become king " "That is not so difficult," said the old woman, "you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep " With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, "If you wear this, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve " When the soldier had received this good advice, he fell to in earnest, took heart, went to the king, and announced himself as a suitor  He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him  He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the antechamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop  Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep  The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said, "He, too, might as well have saved his life " With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses, dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance  Only the youngest said, "I know not how it is, you are very happy, but I feel very strange, some misfortune is certainly about to befall us " "You are a goose, who are always frightened," said the eldest  "Have you forgotten how many kings\' sons have already come here in vain  I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, the booby would not have awakened anyway " When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves safe enough  The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it, whereupon it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first  The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest  Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress, she was terrified at that, and cried out, "What is that? Who is pulling my dress?" "Don\'t be so silly," said the eldest, "you have caught it on a nail " Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened There was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old, who was so handsome and lovable that no one could look at him without liking him, and she herself worshipped him above everything in the world  Now it so happened that he suddenly became ill, and God took him to himself, and for this the mother could not be comforted and wept both day and night  But soon afterwards, when the child had been buried, it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and played during its life, and if the mother wept, it wept also, and when morning came it disappeared  But as the mother would not stop crying, it came one night, in the little white shroud in which it had been laid in its coffin, and with its wreath of flowers round its head, and stood on the bed at her feet, and said, "Oh, mother, do stop crying, or I shall never fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud will not dry because of all your tears, which fall upon it " The mother was afraid when she heard that, and wept no more  The next night the child came again, and held a little light in its hand, and said, "Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my grave " Then the mother gave her sorrow into God\'s keeping, and bore it quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in its little bed beneath the earth  ' ,  "In a certain country there was once great lamentation over a wild boar that laid waste the farmer's fields, killed the cattle, and ripped up people's bodies with his tusks", ' The king promised a large reward to anyone who would free the land from this plague, but the beast was so big and strong that no one dared to go near the forest in which it lived  At last the king gave notice that whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter to wife  Now there lived in the country two brothers, sons of a poor man, who declared themselves willing to undertake the hazardous enterprise, the elder, who was crafty and shrewd, out of pride, the younger, who was innocent and simple, from a kind heart  The king said, in order that you may be the more sure of finding the beast, you must go into the forest from opposite sides  So the elder went in on the west side, and the younger on the east  When the younger had gone a short way, a little man stepped up to him  He held in his hand a black spear and said, I give you this spear because your heart is pure and good, with this you can boldly attack the wild boar, and it will do you no harm  He thanked the little man, shouldered the spear, and went on fearlessly  Before long he saw the beast, which rushed at him, but he held the spear towards it, and in its blind fury it ran so swiftly against it that its heart was cloven in twain  Then he took the monster on his back and went homewards with it to the king  As he came out at the other side of the wood, there stood at the entrance a house where people were making merry with wine and dancing  His elder brother had gone in here, and, thinking that after all the boar would not run away from him, was going to drink until he felt brave  But when he saw his young brother coming out of the wood laden with his booty, his envious, evil heart gave him no peace  He called out to him, come in, dear brother, rest and refresh yourself with a cup of wine  The youth, who suspected no evil, went in and told him about the good little man who had given him the spear wherewith he had slain the boar  The elder brother kept him there until the evening, and then they went away together, and when in the darkness they came to a bridge over a brook, the elder brother let the other go first, and when he was half-way across he gave him such a blow from behind that he fell down dead', " He buried him beneath the bridge, took the boar, and carried it to the king, pretending that he had killed it, whereupon he obtained the king's daughter in marriage", ' And when his younger brother did not come back he said, the boar must have ripped up his body, and every one believed it  But as nothing remains hidden from God, so this black deed also was to come to light  Years afterwards a shepherd was driving his herd across the bridge, and saw lying in the sand beneath, a snow-white little bone  He thought that it would make a good mouth-piece, so he clambered down, picked it up, and cut out of it a mouth-piece for his horn, but when he blew through it for the first time, to his great astonishment, the bone began of its own accord to sing -   ah, friend thou blowest upon my bone', "   Long have I lain beside the water,   my brother slew me for the boar,   and took for his wife the king's young daughter", ' What a wonderful horn, said the shepherd, it sings by itself, I must take it to my lord the king  And when he came with it to the king the horn again began to sing its little song  The king understood it all, and caused the ground below the bridge to be dug up, and then the whole skeleton of the murdered man came to light  The wicked brother could not deny the deed, and was sewn up in a sack and drowned  But the bones of the murdered man were laid to rest in a beautiful tomb in the churchyard   There was once upon a time a man who was about to set out on a long journey, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should bring back with him for them  Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, dear father, I should like a singing, soaring lark  The father said, yes, if I can get it, you shall have it, kissed all three, and set out  Now when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he had brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and he was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child  Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid castle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the tree, he saw a singing, soaring lark  Aha, you come just at the right moment, he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature  But as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook himself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled  He who tries to steal my singing, soaring lark, he cried, will I devour  Then the man said, I did not know that the bird belonged to you  I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a large sum of money, only spare my life  The lion said, nothing can save you, unless you will promise to give me for my own what first meets you on your return home, and if you will do that, I will grant you your life, and you shall have the bird for your daughter, into the bargain  But the man hesitated and said, that might be my youngest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on my return home  The servant, however, was terrified and said, why should your daughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog  Then the man allowed himself to be persuaded, took the singing, soaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first meet him on his return home  When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up, kissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with him a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy  The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, my dearest child, I have bought the little bird dear  In return for it, I have been obliged to promise you to a savage lion, and when he has you he will tear you in pieces and devour you, and he told her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what might  But she consoled him and said, dearest father, indeed your promise must be fulfilled  I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I may return to you safely  Next morning she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest  The lion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all his people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes  On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle  When night came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was celebrated with great magnificence  They lived happily together, remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime', " One day he came and said, to-morrow there is a feast in your father's house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if you are inclined to go there, my lions shall conduct you", ' She said, yes, I should very much like to see my father again, and went thither, accompanied by the lions  There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that she had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live  But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was, remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then went back again to the forest  When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion, this time I will not be alone, you must come with me  The lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle fell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the doves In olden times there lived an aged queen who was a sorceress, and her daughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun  The old woman, however, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to destruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever wished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die', " Many had been dazzled by the daughter's beauty, and had actually risked this, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined them to do, and then no mercy was shown, they had to kneel down, and their heads were struck off", ' A certain king\'s son who had also heard of the maiden\'s beauty, said to his father, "Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage " "Never," answered the king, "if you were to go, it would be going to your death " On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and for seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him  When the father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he said to him, "Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other means of curing you " When the son heard that, he rose from his bed and was well again, and joyfully set out on his way  And it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from afar something like a great heap of hay laying on the ground, and when he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man, who had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small mountain  When the fat man saw the traveler, he stood up and said, "If you are in need of any one, take me into your service " The prince answered, "What can I do with such a clumsy man?" "Oh," said the stout one, "this is nothing, when I really puff myself up, I am three thousand times fatter " "If that\'s the case," said the prince, "I can make use of you, come with me " So the stout one followed the prince, and after a while they found another man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the turf  "What are you doing there?" asked the king\'s son  "I am listening," replied the man  "What are you listening to so attentively?" "I am listening to what is just going on in the world, for nothing escapes my ears, I even hear the grass growing " "Tell me," said the prince, "what you hear at the court of the old queen who has the beautiful daughter " Then he answered, "I hear the whizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer\'s head " The king\'s son said, "I can make use of you, come with me " They went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a pair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body  When they had walked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to the head also  "Why," said the prince, "what a tall rascal you are " "Oh," replied the tall one, "that is nothing at all yet, when I really stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and taller than the highest mountain on earth  I will gladly enter your service, if you will take me " "Come with me," said the prince, "I can make use of you " They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes  The prince said to him, "Have you weak eyes, that you cannot look at the light?" "No," replied the man, "but I must not remove the bandage, for whatsoever I look at with my eyes, splits to pieces, so powerful is my glance  If you can use that, I shall be glad to serve you " "Come with me," replied the king\'s son, "I can make use of you " They journeyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot sunshine, trembling and shivering all over his body, so that not a limb was still Once upon a time, a certain king was hunting in a great forest, and he chased a wild beast so eagerly that none of his attendants could follow him  When evening drew near he stopped and looked around him, and then he saw that he had lost his way  He sought a way out, but could find none  Then he perceived an aged woman with a head which nodded perpetually, who came towards him, but she was a witch  Good woman, said he to her, can you not show me the way through the forest  Oh, yes, lord king, she answered, that I certainly can, but on one condition, and if you do not fulfil that, you will never get out of the forest, and will die of hunger in it  What kind of condition is it, asked the king  I have a daughter, said the old woman, who is as beautiful as anyone in the world, and well deserves to be your consort, and if you will make her your queen, I will show you the way out of the forest  In the anguish of his heart the king consented, and the old woman led him to her little hut, where her daughter was sitting by the fire  She received the king as if she had been expecting him, and he saw that she was very beautiful, but still she did not please him, and he could not look at her without secret horror  After he had taken the maiden up on his horse, the old woman showed him the way, and the king reached his royal palace again, where the wedding was celebrated  The king had already been married once, and had by his first wife, seven children, six boys and a girl, whom he loved better than anything else in the world  As he now feared that the stepmother might not treat them well, and even do them some injury, he took them to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest  It lay so concealed, and the way was so difficult to find that he himself would not have found it, if a wise woman had not given him a ball of yarn with wonderful properties  When he threw it down before him, it unrolled itself and showed him his path  The king, however, went so frequently away to his dear children that the queen observed his absence, she was curious and wanted to know what he did when he was quite alone in the forest  She gave a great deal of money to his servants, and they betrayed the secret to her, and told her likewise of the ball which alone could point out the way  And now she knew no rest until she had learnt where the king kept the ball of yarn, and then she made little shirts of white silk, and as she had learnt the art of witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a charm inside them  And once when the king had ridden forth to hunt, she took the little shirts and went into the forest, and the ball showed her the way  The children, who saw from a distance that someone was approaching, thought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of joy, ran to meet him  Then she threw one of the little shirts over each of them, and no sooner had the shirts touched their bodies than they were changed into swans, and flew away over the forest  The queen went home quite delighted, and thought she had got rid of her step-children, but the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the queen knew nothing about her  Next day the king went to visit his children, but he found no one but the little girl  Where are your brothers, asked the king  Alas, dear father, she answered, they have gone away and left me alone, and she told him that she had seen from her little window how her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers, which they had let fall in the courtyard, and which she had picked up  The king mourned, but he did not think that the queen had done this wicked deed, and as he feared that the girl would also be stolen away from him, he wanted to take her away with him  But she was afraid of her step-mother, and entreated the king to let her stay just this one night more in the forest castle  The poor girl thought, I can no longer stay here  I will go and seek my brothers  And when night came, she ran away, and went straight into the forest There was once a young fellow who had learnt the trade of locksmith, and told his father he would now go out into the world and seek his fortune  Very well, said the father, I am quite content with that, and gave him some money for his journey  So he traveled about and looked for work  After a time he resolved not to follow the trade of locksmith any more, for he no longer liked it, but he took a fancy for hunting  Then there met him in his rambles a huntsman dressed in green, who asked whence he came and whither he was going', " The youth said he was a locksmith's apprentice, but that the trade no longer pleased him, and he had a liking for huntsmanship, would he teach it to him", ' "Oh, yes," said the huntsman, "if you will go with me " Then the young fellow went with him, apprenticed himself to him for some years, and learnt the art of hunting  After this he wished to try his luck elsewhere, and the huntsman gave him nothing in the way of payment but an air-gun, which had, however, this property, that it hit its mark without fail whenever he shot with it  Then he set out and found himself in a very large forest, which he could not get to the end of in one day  When evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts  Towards midnight, it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance  Then he looked down through the branches towards it, and kept well in his mind where it was  But in the first place he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of the light, so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had descended  He got down and went to his hat, put it on again and went straight forwards  The farther he went, the larger the light grew, and when he got close to it he saw that it was an enormous fire, and that three giants were sitting by it, who had an ox on the spit, and were roasting it  Presently one of them said, "I must just taste if the meat will soon be fit to eat," and pulled a piece off, and was about to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand  "Well, really," said the giant, "if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand," and helped himself to another  But when he was just about to bite into it, the huntsman again shot it away from him  On this the giant gave the one who was sitting next him a box on the ear, and cried angrily, "Why are you snatching my piece away from me?" "I have not snatched it away," said the other, "a sharpshooter must have shot it away from you " The giant took another piece, but again could not keep it in his hand, for the huntsman shot it out  Then the giant said, "That must be a good shot to shoot the bit out of one\'s very mouth, such an one would be useful to us " And he cried aloud, "Come here, you sharpshooter, seat yourself at the fire beside us and eat your fill, we will not hurt you, but if you will not come, and we have to bring you by force, you are a lost man " On this the youth went up to them and told them he was a skilled huntsman, and that whatever he aimed at with his gun, he was certain to hit  Then they said if he would go with them he should be well treated, and they told him that outside the forest there was a great lake, behind which stood a tower, and in the tower was imprisoned a lovely princess, whom they wished very much to carry off  "Yes," said he, "I will soon get her for you " Then they added, "But there is still something else, there is a tiny little dog, which begins to bark directly any one goes near, and as soon as it barks every one in the royal palace wakens up, and for this reason we cannot get there, can you undertake to shoot it dead?" "Yes," said he, "that will be quite fun for me " After this he got into a boat and rowed over the lake, and as soon as he landed, the little dog came running out, and was about to bark, but the huntsman took his airgun and shot it dead', " When the giants saw that, they rejoiced, and thought they already had the king's daughter safe, but the huntsman wished first to see how matters stood, and told them that they must stay outside until he called them", ' Then he went into the castle, and all was perfectly quiet within, and every one was asleep The fishes had for a long time been discontented because no order prevailed in their kingdom  None of them turned aside for the others, but all swam to the right or the left as they fancied, or darted between those who wanted to stay together, or got into their way  And a strong one gave a weak one a blow with its tail, which drove it away, or else swallowed it up without more ado  How delightful it would be, said they, if we had a king who enforced law and justice among us, and they met together to choose for their ruler the one who could cleave through the water most quickly, and give help to the weak ones  They placed themselves in rank and file by the shore, and the pike gave the signal with his tail, on which they all started  Like an arrow, the pike darted away, and with him the herring, the gudgeon, the perch, the carp, and all the rest of them  Even the sole swam with them, and hoped to win the race  All at once, the cry was heard, the herring is first, the herring is first  Who is first, screamed angrily the flat envious sole, who had been left far behind, who is first  The herring, the herring, was the answer  The naked herring, cried the jealous creature, the naked herring  Since that time the sole has been punished by having been given a mouth on one side  ' ,  "A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow's nest", ' When they were fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind  Then the old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into the world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger, and given them good instruction how to deal with each  In the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a wheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again, and full of joy took them home with him  Ah, my dear sons, how I have been worrying about you all through the summer, because you got away in the wind without my teaching  Listen to my words, obey your father, and be well on your guard  Little birds have to encounter great dangers  And then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself  I stayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms, until the cherries were ripe  Ah, my son, said the father, tit-bits are not bad, but there is great risk about them  On that account take great care of yourself henceforth, and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top  Yes, father, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax, said the son  Where have you seen that', " In a merchant's garden, said the youngster", ' Oh, my son, merchant folks are smart folks, said the father  If you have been among the children of the world, you have learned worldly craftiness enough, only see that you use it well, and do not be too confident  Then he asked the next, where have you passed your time  At court, said the son  Sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place  There one finds much gold, velvet, silk, armor, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and lanners  Keep to the horses, stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and then fortune may give you your daily grain of corn in peace  Yes, father, said the son, but when the stable-boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught  Where have you seen that, said the old bird  At court, among the stable-boys  Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys  If you have been to court and among the lords, and have left no feathers there, you have learnt a fair amount, and will know very well how to go about the world, but look around you and above you, for the wolves often devour the wisest dogs  The father examined the third also, where did you seek your fortune  I have cast my tub and rope on the cart-roads and highways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley  That is indeed dainty fare, said the father, but take care what you are about and look carefully around, especially when you see anyone stooping and about to pick up a stone, for then you have not much time to waste  That is true, said the son, but what if anyone should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready beforehand in his breast or pocket There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child  All alone, in a small house at the end of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by spinning, weaving, and sewing  The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her to her work, and educated her in all that is good  When the girl was fifteen years old, the old woman became ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, dear daughter, I feel my end drawing near  I leave you the little house, which will protect you from wind and weather, and my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which you can earn your bread', " Then she laid her hands on the girl's head, blessed her, and said, only preserve the love of God in your heart, and all will go well with you", ' Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect  And now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was industrious, and spun, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the good old woman was on all that she did  It seemed as if the flax in the room increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of nothing, and even had something to share with others  About this time, the son of the king was traveling about the country looking for a bride  He was not to choose a poor one, and did not want to have a rich one  So he said, she shall be my wife who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest  When he came to the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in the place  They first named the richest  The poorest, they said, was the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the village  The rich girl was sitting in all her splendor before the door of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up, went to meet him, and made him a low curtsy  He looked at her, said nothing, and rode on  When he came to the house of the poor girl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little room  He stopped his horse, and saw through the window, on which the bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at her spinning-wheel, busily spinning  She looked up, and when she saw that the prince was looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall, and went on spinning', " I do not know whether, just at that moment, the thread was quite even, but she went on spinning until the king's son had ridden away again", ' Then she went to the window, opened it, and said, it is so warm in this room, and she looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat  Then she sat down to work again in her room and went on with her spinning, and a saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her mind, and she sang these words to herself,   spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,   and here to my house bring the wooer, I pray  And what do you think happened  The spindle sprang out of her hand in an instant, and out of the door, and when, in her astonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was dancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining gold thread after it  Before long, it had entirely vanished from her sight', " As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver's shuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave", ' The spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as the thread came to an end, reached the prince  What do I see, he cried, the spindle certainly wants to show me the way, turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread  The girl however, was sitting at her work singing,   shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day,   and guide the wooer to me, I pray There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early morning till late at night  When at last he had laid by some money he said to his boy, "You are my only child, I will spend the money which I have earned with the sweat of my brow on your education, if you learn some honest trade you can support me in my old age, when my limbs have grown stiff and I am obliged to stay at home " Then the boy went to a high school and learned diligently so that his masters praised him, and he remained there a long time  When he had worked through two classes, but was still not yet perfect in everything, the little pittance which the father had earned was all spent, and the boy was obliged to return home to him  "Ah," said the father, sorrowfully, "I can give you no more, and in these hard times I cannot earn a farthing more than will suffice for our daily bread " "Dear father," answered the son, "don\'t trouble yourself about it, if it is God\'s will, it will turn to my advantage  I shall soon accustom myself to it " When the father wanted to go into the forest to earn money by helping to chop and stack wood, the son said, "I will go with you and help you " "Nay, my son," said the father, "that would be hard for you  You are not accustomed to rough work, and will not be able to bear it  Besides, I have only one axe and no money left wherewith to buy another " "Just go to the neighbor," answered the son, "he will lend you his axe until I have earned one for myself " The father then borrowed an axe of the neighbor, and next morning at break of day they went out into the forest together  The son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about it  But when the sun was right over their heads, the father said, "We will rest, and have our dinner, and then we shall work twice as well " The son took his bread in his hands, and said, "Just you rest, father, I am not tired, I will walk up and down a little in the forest, and look for birds\' nests " "Oh, you fool," said the father, "why should you want to run about there? Afterwards you will be tired, and no longer able to raise your arm  Stay here, and sit down beside me " The son, however, went into the forest, ate his bread, was very merry and peered in among the green branches to see if he could discover a bird\'s nest anywhere  So he walked to and fro until at last he came to a great dangerous-looking oak, which certainly was already many hundred years old, and which five men could not have spanned  He stood still and looked at it, and thought, many a bird must have built its nest in that  Then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice  He listened and became aware that someone was crying in a very smothered voice, "Let me out, let me out " He looked around, but could discover nothing  Then he fancied that the voice came out of the ground  So he cried, "Where are you?" The voice answered, "I am down here amongst the roots of the oak-tree  Let me out  Let me out " The schoolboy began to loosen the earth under the tree, and search among the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little hollow  He lifted it up and held it against the light, and then saw a creature shaped like a frog, springing up and down in it There was once upon a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had a room to live in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her  She was good and pious, however  And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God  Then a poor man met her, who said, ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry  She handed him the whole of her piece of bread, and said, may God bless you, and went onwards  Then came a child who moaned and said, my head is so cold, give me something to cover it with  So she took off her hood and gave it to him  And when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold  Then she gave it her own, and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also  At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself, it is a dark night and no one sees you, you can very well give your shirt away, and took it off, and gave away that also  And as she so stood, and had not one single thing left, suddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just given her shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very finest linen  Then she put the money into it, and was rich all the days of her life   A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children, and a good friend who had come on a visit ate with them', " And as they thus sat, and it was striking twelve o'clock, the stranger saw the door open, and a very pale child dressed in snow-white clothes came in", ' It did not look around, and it did not speak, but went straight into the next room  Soon afterwards it came back, and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner  On the second and on the third day, it came also exactly in the same way  At last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged  I have never seen it, said he, neither did he know to whom it could belong  The next day when it again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, who however did not see it, and the mother and the children also all saw nothing  At this the stranger got up, went to the room door, opened it a little, and peeped in  Then he saw the child sitting on the ground, and busily digging and seeking about between the boards of the floor, but when it saw the stranger, it disappeared  He now told what he had seen and described the child exactly, and the mother recognized it, and said, ah, it is my dear child who died a month ago  They took up the boards and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother that it might give them to a poor man  It, however, had thought, you can buy yourself a biscuit for that, and had kept the farthings, and hidden them in the openings between the boards  And therefore it had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon to seek for these farthings  The parents gave the money at once to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again  ' ,  "A certain father had two sons, the elder of whom was smart and sensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said 'there's a fellow who will give his father some trouble", "' When anything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it, but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered 'oh, no, father, I'll not go there, it makes me shudder", "' For he was afraid", " Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said 'oh, it makes us shudder", "' The younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean", " 'They are always saying 'it makes me shudder, it makes me shudder, it does not make me shudder", "' Thought he", " 'That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing", "' Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day 'hearken to me, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread", ' Look how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt', "' 'Well, father, he replied, 'I am quite willing to learn something - indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder", " I don't understand that at all yet", "' The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself 'good God, what a blockhead that brother of mine is", ' He will never be good for anything as long as he lives  He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes', "' The father sighed, and answered him 'you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that", "' Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing", " 'Just think, said he, 'when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder", "' 'If that be all, replied the sexton, 'he can learn that with me", ' Send him to me, and I will soon polish him', "' The father was glad to do it, for he thought 'it will train the boy a little", "' The sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring the church bell", ' After a day or two, the sexton awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell', " 'You shall soon learn what shuddering is, thought he, and secretly went there before him, and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole", " 'Who is there", "' Cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir", " 'Give an answer, cried the boy, 'or take yourself off, you have no business here at night", "' The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost", " The boy cried a second time 'what do you want here", ' - Speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps In the time of schlauraffen I went forth and saw rome and the lateran hanging by a small silken thread, and a man without feet who outran a swift horse, and a keen sharp sword that cut through a bridge  I saw a young ass with a silver nose which pursued two fleet hares, and a lime-tree that was very large, on which hot cakes were growing  I saw a lean old goat which carried about a hundred cart-loads of fat on his body, and sixty loads of salt  Have I not told enough lies  I saw a plough ploughing without horse or cow, and a child of one year threw four millstones from ratisbon to treves, and from treves to strasburg, and a hawk swam over the rhine, which he had a perfect right to do  I heard some fishes begin to make such a disturbance with each other, that it resounded as far as heaven, and sweet honey flowed like water from a deep valley to the top of a high mountain, and these were strange things  There were two crows which were mowing a meadow, and I saw two gnats building a bridge, and two doves tore a wolf to pieces, two children brought forth two kids, and two frogs threshed corn together', " I saw two mice consecrating a bishop, and two cats scratching out a bear's tongue", ' Then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions', " There stood a barber and shaved a woman's beard off, and two sucking-children bade their mother hold her tongue", ' There I saw two greyhounds which brought a mill out of the water, and a broken-down old horse was beside it, and said it was right  And four horses were standing in the yard threshing corn with all their might, and two goats were heating the stove, and a red cow shot the bread into the oven  Then a hen crowed, cock-a-doodle-doo  The story is all told, cock-a-doodle-doo   In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them  So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw  When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two  Then the straw began and said, dear friends, from whence do you come here  The coal replied, I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes  The bean said, I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades  And would a better fate have fallen to my lot, said the straw  The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke  She seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives  I luckily slipped through her fingers  But what are we to do now, said the coal  I think, answered the bean, that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country  The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together  Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it  The straw hit on a good idea, and said, I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge  The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge  But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was, after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther  The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream  The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last  The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst  It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was traveling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook  As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together  The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam   One very fine day it came to pass that the good God wished to enjoy himself in the heavenly garden, and took all the apostles and saints with him, so that no one stayed in heaven but saint peter  The Lord had commanded him to let no one in during his absence, so peter stood by the door and kept watch  Before long someone knocked  Peter asked who was there, and what he wanted  I am a poor, honest tailor who prays for admission, replied a smooth voice  Honest indeed, said peter, like the thief on the gallows  You have been light-fingered and have snipped folks, clothes away  You will not get into heaven  The Lord has forbidden me to let anyone in while he is out  Come, do be merciful, cried the tailor  Little scraps which fall off the table of their own accord are not stolen, and are not worth speaking about  Look, I am lame, and have blisters on my feet from walking here, I cannot possibly turn back again  Just let me in, and I will do all the dirty work  I will carry the children, and wash their clothes, and scrub and clean the benches on which they have been playing, and patch all their torn frocks  Saint peter let himself be moved by pity, and opened the door of heaven just wide enough for the lame tailor to slip his lean body in  He was forced to sit down in a corner behind the door, and told to stay quietly and peaceably there, in order that the Lord, when he returned, might not observe him and be angry  The tailor obeyed, but once when saint peter went outside the door, he got up, and full of curiosity, peeped into every corner of heaven, and inspected the arrangement of the whole place  At length he came to a spot where many beautiful and precious chairs were standing, and in the midst was a seat all of gold which was set with shining jewels  Likewise it was much higher than the other chairs, and a footstool of gold was before it  It was the seat, however, on which the Lord sat when he was at home, and from which he could see all that happened on earth  The tailor stood still, and looked at the seat for a long time, for it pleased him better than all else  At last he could master his curiosity no longer, and climbed up and seated himself in the chair  Then he saw everything which was happening on earth, and observed an ugly old woman who was standing washing by the side of a stream, secretly laying two veils on one side for herself  The sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool, and threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief  But since he could not bring the stool back again, he slipped quietly out of the chair, seated himself in his place behind the door, and behaved as if he had never stirred from the spot  When the Lord and master returned again with his heavenly companions, he did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated himself on his chair the footstool was missing  He asked saint peter what had become of the stool, but he did not know  Then he asked if he had let anyone come in  I know of no one who has been here, answered peter, but a lame tailor, who is still sitting behind the door  Then the Lord had the tailor brought before him, and asked him if he had taken away the stool, and where he had put it Hans wished to put his son to learn a trade, so he went into the church and prayed to our Lord God to know which would be the most suitable for him  Then the clerk got behind the altar, and said, thieving, thieving  On this Hans goes back to his son, and tells him he is to learn thieving, and that the Lord God had said so  So he goes with his son to seek a man who is acquainted with thieving  They walk a long time and come into a great forest, where stands a little house with an old woman in it  Hans says, do you know of a man who is acquainted with thieving  You can learn that here quite well, says the woman, my son is a master of it  So he speaks with the son, and asks if he knows thieving really well  The master-thief says, I will teach him well', " Come back when a year is over, and then if you recognize your son, I will take no payment at all for teaching him, but if you don't know him, you must give me two hundred talers", ' The father goes home again, and the son learns witchcraft and thieving, thoroughly  When the year is out, the father is full of anxiety to know how he shall recognize his son  As he is thus going about in his trouble, he meets a little dwarf, who says, man, what ails you, that you are always in such trouble', " Oh, says Hans, a year ago I placed my son with a master-thief who told me I was to come back when the year was out, and that if I then did not know my son when I saw him, I was to pay two hundred talers, but if I did know him I was to pay nothing, and now I am afraid of not knowing him and can't tell where I am to get the money", ' Then the dwarf tells him to take a crust of bread with him, and to stand beneath the chimney  There on the cross-beam is a basket, out of which a little bird is peeping, and that is your son  Hans goes thither, and throws a crust of black bread in front of the basket with the bird in it, and the little bird comes out, and looks up  Hello, my son, are you here, says the father, and the son is delighted to see his father, but the master-thief says, the devil must have prompted you, or how could you have known your son  Father, let us go, said the youth  Then the father and son set out homeward  On the way a carriage comes driving by  Hereupon the son says to his father, I will change myself into a large greyhound, and then you can earn a great deal of money by me  Then the gentleman calls from the carriage, my man, will you sell your dog  Yes, says the father  How much do you want for it  Thirty talers  Well, man, that is a great deal, but as it is such a very fine dog I will have it  The gentleman takes it into his carriage, but when they have driven a little farther the dog springs out of the carriage through the window, and goes back to his father, and is no longer a greyhound  They go home together  Next day there is a fair in the neighboring town, so the youth says to his father, I will now change myself into a beautiful horse, and you can sell me, but when you have sold me, you must take off my bridle, or I cannot become a man again There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always together while traveling, and always to work in the same town  At one time, however, their masters had no more work to give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing to live on  Then one of them said, what shall we do  We cannot stay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do not find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with the innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we are staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and then we will separate  And that seemed best to the others also  They went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were  We are apprentices looking for work  Up to this time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything to do we are going to separate  There is no need for that, said the man, if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for gold or for work  Nay, you shall become great lords, and drive in your carriages  One of them said, if our souls and salvation be not endangered, we will certainly do it  They will not, replied the man, I have no claim on you', " One of the others, however, had looked at his feet, and when he saw a horse's foot and a man's foot, he did not want to have anything to do with him", ' Then the devil said, be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another soul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall but run full  As they were now secure, they consented, and the devil told them what he wanted  The first was to answer, all three of us, to every question  The second was to say, for money, and the third, and quite right too  They were always to say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one word more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would disappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets would always be full  As a beginning, he at once gave them as much as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town  They went to it, and the innkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for anything to eat  The first replied, all three of us  Yes, said the host, that is what I mean  The second said, for money  Of course, said the host  The third said, and quite right too  Certainly it is right, said the host  Good meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well waited on  After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said, all three of us, the second said, for money, and the third, and quite right too  Indeed it is right, said the host, all three pay, and without money I can give nothing  They, however, paid even more than he had asked Three army surgeons who thought they knew their art perfectly were traveling about the world, and they came to an inn where they wanted to pass the night  The host asked whence they came, and whither they were going  We are roaming about the world and practising our art  Show me just once what you can do, said the host  Then the first said he would cut off his hand, and put it on again early next morning  The second said he would tear out his heart, and replace it next morning  The third said he would gouge out his eyes and heal them again next morning  If you can do that, said the innkeeper, you have learnt everything  They, however, had a salve, with which they rubbed themselves, which joined parts together, and they constantly carried with them the little bottle in which it was  Then they cut the hand, heart and eyes from their bodies as they had said they would, and laid them all together on a plate, and gave it to the innkeeper  The innkeeper gave it to a servant-girl who was to set it in the cupboard, and take good care of it  Secretly, however, the girl had a lover, who was a soldier  When therefore the innkeeper, the three army surgeons, and everyone else in the house were asleep, the soldier came and wanted something to eat  The girl opened the cupboard and brought him some food, and in her love forgot to shut the cupboard-door again  She seated herself at the table by her lover, and they chatted away together  While she sat so contentedly there, thinking of no ill luck, the cat came creeping in, found the cupboard open, took the hand and heart and eyes of the three army surgeons, and ran off with them  When the soldier had done eating, and the girl was taking away the things and going to shut the cupboard, she saw that the plate which the innkeeper had given her to take care of, was empty  Then she said in a fright to her lover, ah, miserable girl, what shall I do  The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what will become of me in the morning  Be easy, said he, I will help you out of your trouble  There is a thief hanging outside on the gallows, I will cut off his hand  Which hand was it  The right one', " Then the girl gave him a sharp knife, and he went and cut the poor sinner's right hand off, and brought it to her", ' After this he caught the cat and gouged its eyes out, and now nothing but the heart was missing  Have you not been slaughtering, and are not the dead pigs in the cellar, said he  Yes, said the girl', " That's fine, said the soldier, and he went down and fetched a pig's heart", ' The girl placed all together on the plate, and put it in the cupboard, and when after this her lover took leave of her, she went quietly to bed  In the morning when the three army surgeons got up, they told the girl she was to bring them the plate on which the hand, heart, and eyes were lying East india was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until he had received six hundred dollars  Then the townsfolk caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to procure the money should be burgomaster  Now there was a poor fisherman who fished on the sea with his son, and the enemy came and took the son prisoner, and gave the father six hundred dollars for him  So the father went and gave them to the great men of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became burgomaster', " Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say 'mr", ' Burgomaster, should be put to death on the gallows  The son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great forest on a high mountain  The mountain opened, and he went into a great enchanted castle, wherein chairs, tables, and benches were all hung with black  Then came three young princesses who were dressed entirely in black, but had a little white on their faces  They told him he was not to be afraid, they would not hurt him, and that he could rescue them  He said he would gladly do that, if he did but know how  At this, they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them and also not look at them, and what he wanted to have he was just to ask for, and if they dared give him an answer they would do so  When he had been there for a long while he said he should like to go to his father, and they told him he might go  He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this coat, and in a week he must be back there again  Then he was lifted up, and was instantly in east india', " He could no longer find his father in the fisherman's hut, and asked the people where the poor fisherman could be, and they told him he must not say that, or he would come to the gallows", ' Then he went to his father and said, fisherman, how have you got here  Then the father said, you must not say that, if the great men of the town knew of that, you would come to the gallows  He, however, would not give in, and was brought to the gallows', " When he was there, he said, o, my masters, just give me leave to go to the old fisherman's hut", ' Then he put on his old smock, and came back to the great men, and said, do you not now see  Am I not the son of the poor fisherman  Did I not earn bread for my father and mother in this dress  Hereupon his father knew him again, and begged his pardon, and took him home with him, and then related all that had happened to him, and how he had got into a forest on a high mountain, and the mountain had opened and he had gone into an enchanted castle, where all was black, and three young princesses had come to him who were black except a little white on their faces  And they had told him not to fear, and that he could rescue them  Then his mother said that might very likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to take a blessed candle with him, and drop some boiling wax on their faces  He went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped the wax on their faces as they were sleeping, and they all turned half-white  Then all the three princesses sprang up, and said, you accursed dog, our blood shall cry for vengeance on you  Now there is no man born in the world, nor will any ever be born who can set us free  We have still three brothers who are bound by seven chains - they shall tear you to pieces There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the world but the house in which he lived', " Now each of the sons wished to have the house after his father's death, but the father loved them all alike, and did not know what to do, he did not wish to sell the house, because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have divided the money amongst them", ' At last he conceived a plan, and he said to his sons, "Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a trade, and, when you all come back, he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house " The sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master  They fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each went his way  It chanced that they all found skillful masters, who taught them their trades well  The blacksmith had to shoe the king\'s horses, and he thought to himself, "The house is mine, without doubt " The barber shaved only distinguished people, and he too already looked upon the house as his own  The fencing-master suffered many a blow, but he grit his teeth, and let nothing vex him, for, said he to himself, "If you are afraid of a blow, you\'ll never win the house " When the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back home to their father, but they did not know how to find the best opportunity for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted together  As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running across the field  Ah, ha, just in time, said the barber', " So he took his basin and soap, and lathered away until the hare drew near, then he soaped and shaved off the hare's whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body", ' "Well done," said the old man  "If the others do not make a great effort, the house is yours " Soon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full speed  "Now you shall see what I can do, father," said the blacksmith  So away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off the feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put on four new shoes without stopping him  "You are a fine fellow, and as clever as your brother," said his father  "I do not know to which I ought to give the house " Then the third son said, "Father, let me have my turn, if you please," and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and flourished it backwards and forwards above his head so fast that not a drop fell upon him  It rained still harder and harder, till at last it came down in torrents, but he only flourished his sword faster and faster, and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a house  When his father saw this he was amazed, and said, "This is the masterpiece, the house is yours " His brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand, and, as they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together in the house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so well and were so clever, they earned a great deal of money  Thus they lived together happily until they grew old, and at last, when one of them fell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely about it that they also fell ill, and soon after died  And because they had been so clever, and had loved one another so much, they were all laid in the same grave   There was once upon a time a king who had three sons, of whom two were clever and wise, but the third did not speak much, and was simple, and was called the simpleton  When the king had become old and weak, and was thinking of his end, he did not know which of his sons should inherit the kingdom after him  Then he said to them, go forth, and he who brings me the most beautiful carpet shall be king after my death  And that there should be no dispute amongst them, he took them outside his castle, blew three feathers in the air, and said, you shall go as they fly  One feather flew to the east, the other to the west, but the third flew straight up and did not fly far, but soon fell to the ground  And now one brother went to the right, and the other to the left, and they mocked simpleton, who was forced to stay where the third feather had fallen  He sat down and was sad  Then all at once he saw that there was a trap-door close by the feather  He raised it up, found some steps, and went down them  Then he came to another door, knocked at it, and heard somebody inside calling -      little green waiting-maid,      waiting-maid with the limping leg,      little dog of the limping leg,      hop hither and thither,      and quickly see who is without  The door opened, and he saw a great, fat toad sitting, and round about her a crowd of little toads  The fat toad asked what he wanted  He answered, I should like to have the prettiest and finest carpet in the world  Then she called a young one and said -      little green waiting-maid,      waiting-maid with the limping leg,      little dog of the limping leg,      hop hither and thither,      and bring me the great box  The young toad brought the box, and the fat toad opened it, and gave simpleton a carpet out of it, so beautiful and so fine, that on the earth above, none could have been woven like it  Then he thanked her, and climbed out again  The two others, however, had looked on their youngest brother as so stupid that they believed he would find and bring nothing at all', " Why should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble searching, said they, and got some coarse handkerchiefs from the first shepherds' wives whom they met, and carried them home to the king", ' At the same time simpleton also came back, and brought his beautiful carpet, and when the king saw it he was astonished, and said, if justice be done, the kingdom belongs to the youngest  But the two others let their father have no peace, and said that it was impossible that simpleton, who in everything lacked understanding, should be king, and entreated him to make a new agreement with them  Then the father said, he who brings me the most beautiful ring shall inherit the kingdom, and led the three brothers out, and blew into the air three feathers, which they were to follow', " Those of the two eldest again went east and west, and simpleton's feather flew straight up, and fell down near the door into the earth", ' Then he went down again to the fat toad, and told her that he wanted the most beautiful ring  She at once ordered her big box to be brought, and gave him a ring out of it, which sparkled with jewels, and was so beautiful that no goldsmith on earth would have been able to make it  The two eldest laughed at simpleton for going to seek a golden ring  They gave themselves no trouble, but knocked the nails out of an old carriage-ring, and took it to the king, but when simpleton produced his golden ring, his father again said, the kingdom belongs to him  The two eldest did not cease from tormenting the king until he made a third condition, and declared that the one who brought the most beautiful woman home, should have the kingdom  He again blew the three feathers into the air, and they flew as before  Then simpleton without more ado went down to the fat toad, and said, I am to take home the most beautiful woman  Oh, answered the toad, the most beautiful woman There was once upon a time a hermit who lived in a forest at the foot of a mountain, and passed his time in prayer and good works, and every evening he carried, to the glory of God, two pails of water up the mountain  Many a beast drank of it, and many a plant was refreshed by it, for on the heights above, a strong wind blew continually, which dried the air and the ground, and the wild birds which dread mankind wheel about there, and with their sharp eyes search for a drink', " And because the hermit was so pious, an angel of God, visible to his eyes, went up with him, counted his steps, and when the work was completed, brought him his food, even as the prophet of old was by God's command fed by the raven", ' When the hermit in his piety had already reached a great age, it happened that he once saw from afar a poor sinner being taken to the gallows  He said carelessly to himself, there, that one is getting his deserts  In the evening, when he was carrying the water up the mountain, the angel who usually accompanied him did not appear, and also brought him no food  Then he was terrified, and searched his heart, and tried to think how he could have sinned, as God was so angry, but he did not discover it  Then he neither ate nor drank, threw himself down on the ground, and prayed day and night  And as he was one day thus bitterly weeping in the forest, he heard a little bird singing beautifully and delightfully, and then he was still more troubled and said, how joyously you sing, the Lord is not angry with you  Ah, if you could but tell me how I can have offended him, that I might do penance, and then my heart also would be glad again  Then the bird began to speak and said, you have done injustice, in that you have condemned a poor sinner who was being led to the gallows, and for that the Lord is angry with you  He alone sits in judgement  However, if you will do penance and repent your sins, he will forgive you  Then the angel stood beside him with a dry branch in his hand and said, you shall carry this dry branch until three green twigs sprout out of it, but at night when you will sleep, you shall lay it under your head  You shall beg your bread from door to door, and not tarry more than one night in the same house  That is the penance which the Lord lays on you  Then the hermit took the piece of wood, and went back into the world, which he had not seen for so long  He ate and drank nothing but what was given him at the doors  Many petitions, however, were not listened to, and many doors remained shut to him, so that he often did not get a crumb of bread  Once when he had gone from door to door from morning till night, and no one had given him anything, and no one would shelter him for the night, he went forth into a forest, and at last found a cave which someone had made, and an old woman was sitting in it  Then said he, good woman, keep me with you in your house for this night  But she said, no, I dare not, even if I wished, I have three sons who are wicked and wild, if they come home from their robbing expedition, and find you, they would kill us both  The hermit said, let me stay, they will do no injury either to you or to me  And the old woman was compassionate, and let herself be persuaded  Then the man lay down beneath the stairs, and put the bit of wood under his head  When the old woman saw him do that, she asked the reason of it, on which he told her that he carried the bit of wood about with him for a penance, and used it at night for a pillow, and that he had offended the Lord, because, when he had seen a poor sinner on the way to the gallows, he had said he was getting his deserts  Then the woman began to weep and cried, if the Lord punishes one single word, how will it fare with my sons when they appear before him in judgment  At midnight the robbers came home and blustered and stormed  They made a fire, and when it had lighted up the cave and they saw a man lying under the stairs, they fell in a rage and cried to their mother, who is the man  Have we not forbidden anyone whomsoever to be taken in An aged count once lived in switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing  Then said the father, hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head  You must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you  The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with the master  At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked, now, my son, what have you learnt  Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark  Lord have mercy on us, cried the father, is that all you have learnt  I will send you into another town, to another master  The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise  When he came back the father again asked, my son, what have you learnt  He answered, father, I have learnt what the birds say  Then the father fell into a rage and said, oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing, are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes  I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father  The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired, my son, what have you learnt  He answered, dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak  Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said, this man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him  They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and the tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token', " The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night's lodging", ' Yes, said the lord of the castle, if you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither, but I warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them, whom they at once devour  The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this  The youth, however, was without fear, and said, just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them, they will do nothing to harm me  As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower  When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head  Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle, the dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land  They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done  Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully  He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him  The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more, they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble  After some time he took it into his head that he would travel to Rome  On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting  Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the king with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, hullo  Hullo  If I do not get that one, I will have none', " Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the king's right hand, hullo", ' Hullo  If I do not get him, I will have no one  These, however, were the two ministers  The king heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain  This they would not tell him, so the king asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband  Then she said, yes, and the two ministers married the two sisters, for they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially the queen, who had hair like flax  But the two sisters had no children, and once when the king was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child  She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him  Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water', " When they had thrown him in - I believe it was into the Weser - a little bird flew up into the air, which sang -      to thy death art thou sped      until God's word be said", '      In the white lily bloom,      brave boy, is thy tomb  When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste  When the king came home they told him that the queen had been delivered of a dog  Then the king said, what God does, is well done  But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him  When a year had gone by, the king again went away, and the queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water', " Then up flew a little bird again and sang -      to thy death art thou sped      until God's word be said", '      In the white lily bloom,      brave boy, is thy tomb  And when the king came back, they told him that the queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, what God does, is well done  The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him  Then the king again journeyed forth, and the queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water', " Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang -      to thy death art thou sped      until God's word be said", '      In the white lily bloom,      bonny girl, is thy tomb  And when the king came home they told him that the queen had been delivered of a cat  Then the king grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years There was once a man whose wife died, and a woman whose husband died, and the man had a daughter, and the woman also had a daughter  The girls were acquainted with each other, and went out walking together, and afterwards came to the woman in her house', " Then said she to the man's daughter, listen, tell your father that I would like to marry him, and then you shall wash yourself in milk every morning, and drink wine, but my own daughter shall wash herself in water and drink water", ' The girl went home, and told her father what the woman had said  The man said, what shall I do  Marriage is a joy and also a torment  At length as he could come to no decision, he pulled off his boot, and said, take this boot, it has a hole in the sole of it  Go with it up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into it  If it hold the water, then I will again take a wife, but if it run through, I will not  The girl did as she was bid, but the water drew the hole together and the boot became full to the top  She informed her father how it had turned out  Then he himself went up, and when he saw that she was right, he went to the widow and wooed her, and the wedding was celebrated', " The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the man's daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink, but before the woman's daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking", " On the second morning, stood water for washing and water for drinking before the man's daughter as well as before the woman's daughter", " And on the third morning stood water for washing and water for drinking before the man's daughter, and milk for washing and wine for drinking, before the woman's daughter, and so it continued", " The woman became her step-daughter's bitterest enemy, and day by day did her best to treat her still worse", ' She was also envious because her step-daughter was beautiful and lovable, and her own daughter ugly and repulsive  Once, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone, and hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock of paper, called her step-daughter, and said, here, put on this dress and go out into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of strawberries - I have a fancy for some  Good heavens, said the girl, no strawberries grow in winter  The ground is frozen, and besides the snow has covered everything  And why am I to go in this paper frock', " It is so cold outside that one's very breath freezes", ' The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns tear it off my body  Will you contradict me, said the step-mother  See that you go, and do not show your face again until you have the basketful of strawberries  Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said, this will last you the day, and thought, you will die of cold and hunger outside, and will never be seen again by me  Then the maiden was obedient, and put on the paper frock, and went out with the basket  Far and wide there was nothing but snow, and not a green blade to be seen  When she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped three little men  She wished them good day, and knocked modestly at the door A certain king had three sons who were all equally dear to him, and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor after his own death  When the time came when he was about to die, he summoned them to his bedside and said, dear children, I have been thinking of something which I will declare unto you, whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom  The eldest said, then, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I lie down to rest, and a drop falls in my eye, I will not open it that I may sleep  The second said, father, the kingdom belongs to me, for I am so idle that when I am sitting by the fire warming myself, I would rather let my heel be burnt off than draw back my leg  The third said, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I were going to be hanged, and had the rope already round my neck, and any one put a sharp knife into my hand with which I might cut the rope, I would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope  When the father heard that, he said, you have carried it the farthest, and shall be king   There was once on a time a poor man, who could no longer support his only son  Then said the son, dear father, things go so badly with us that I am a burden to you  I would rather go away and see how I can earn my bread  So the father gave him his blessing, and with great sorrow took leave of him  At this time the king of a mighty empire was at war and the youth took service with him, and went out to fight  And when he came before the enemy, there was a battle, and great danger, and it rained shot until his comrades fell on all sides, and when the leader also was killed, those left were about to take flight, but the youth stepped forth, spoke boldly to them, and cried, we will not let our father-land be ruined  Then the others followed him, and he pressed on and conquered the enemy  When the king heard that he owed the victory to him alone, he raised him above all the others, gave him great treasures, and made him the first in the kingdom  The king had a daughter who was very beautiful, but she was also very strange  She had made a vow to take no one as her lord and husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive with her if she died first  If he loves me with all his heart, said she, of what use will life be to him afterwards  On her side she would do the same, and if he died first, would go down to the grave with him  This strange oath had up to this time frightened away all wooers, but the youth became so charmed with her beauty that he cared for nothing, but asked her father for her  But do you know what you must promise, said the king  I must be buried with her, he replied, if I outlive her, but my love is so great that I do not mind the danger  Then the king consented, and the wedding was solemnized with great splendor  They lived now for a while happy and contented with each other, and then it befell that the young queen was attacked by a severe illness, and no physician could save her  And as she lay there dead, the young king remembered what he had been obliged to promise, and was horrified at having to lie down alive in the grave, but there was no escape  The king had placed sentries at all the gates, and it was not possible to avoid his fate  As the day came when the corpse was to be buried, he was taken down with it into the royal vault and then the door was shut and bolted  Near the coffin stood a table on which were four candles, four loaves of bread, and four bottles of wine, and when this provision came to an end, he would have to die of hunger  And now he sat there full of pain and grief, ate every day only a little piece of bread, drank only a mouthful of wine, and nevertheless saw death daily drawing nearer  Whilst he thus gazed before him, he saw a snake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body  And as he thought it came to gnaw at it, he drew his sword and said, as long as I live, you shall not touch her, and hewed the snake in three pieces  After a time a second snake crept out of the hole, and when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces, it went back, but soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth  Then it took the three pieces of the snake, laid them together, as they fitted, and placed one of the leaves on each wound  Immediately the severed parts joined themselves together, the snake moved, and became alive again, and both of them hastened away together  The leaves were left lying on the ground, and a desire came into the mind of the unhappy man who had been watching all this, to know if the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the snake to life again, could not likewise be of service to a human being  So he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his dead wife, and the two others on her eyes  And hardly had he done this than the blood stirred in her veins, rose into her pale face, and colored it again A father once called his three sons before him, and he gave to the first a cock, to the second a scythe, and to the third a cat  I am already aged, said he, my death is nigh, and I have wished to provide for you before my end, money I have not, and what I now give you seems of little worth, but all depends on your making a sensible use of it  Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown, and your fortune is made', " After the father's death the eldest went away with his cock, but wherever he came the cock was already known, in the towns he saw him from a long distance, sitting upon the steeples and turning round with the wind, and in the villages he heard more than one crowing, no one would show any wonder at the creature, so that it did not look as if he would make his fortune by it", ' At last, however, it happened that he came to an island where the people knew nothing about cocks, and did not even understand how to divide their time  They certainly knew when it was morning or evening, but at night, if they did not sleep through it, not one of them knew how to find out the time  Look  Said he, what a proud creature  It has a ruby-red crown upon its head, and wears spurs like a knight, it calls you three times during the night, at fixed hours, and when it calls for the last time, the sun soon rises  But if it crows by broad daylight, then take notice, for there will certainly be a change of weather', " The people were well pleased, for a whole night they did not sleep, and listened with great delight as the cock at two, four, and six o'clock, loudly and clearly proclaimed the time", ' They asked if the creature were for sale, and how much he wanted for it  About as much gold as an ass can carry, answered he  A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature  They cried unanimously, and willingly gave him what he had asked  When he came home with his wealth his brothers were astonished, and the second said, well, I will go forth and see whether I cannot get rid of my scythe as profitably  But it did not look as if he would, for laborers met him everywhere, and they had scythes upon their shoulders as well as he  At last, however, he chanced upon an island where the people knew nothing of scythes  When the corn was ripe there, they took cannon out to the fields and shot it down  Now this was rather an uncertain affair, many shot right over it, others hit the ears instead of the stems, and shot them away, whereby much was lost, and besides all this, it made a terrible noise  So the man set to work and mowed it down so quietly and quickly that the people opened their mouths with astonishment  They agreed to give him what he wanted for the scythe, and he received a horse laden with as much gold as it could carry  And now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man  He fared just like the others, so long as he stayed on the mainland there was nothing to be done  Every place had cats, and there were so many of them that new-born kittens were generally drowned in the ponds  At last he sailed over to an island, and it luckily happened that no cats had ever yet been seen there, and that the mice had got the upper hand so much that they danced upon the tables and benches whether the master were at home or not  The people complained bitterly of the plague, the king himself in his palace did not know how to protect himself against them, mice squeaked in every corner, and gnawed whatever they could lay hold of with their teeth  But now the cat began her chase, and soon cleared a couple of rooms, and the people begged the king to buy the wonderful beast for the country  The king willingly gave what was asked, which was a mule laden with gold, and the third brother came home with the greatest treasure of all  The cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace, and killed so many that they could not be counted There was once a girl who was idle and would not spin, and let her mother say what she would, she could not bring her to it  At last the mother was once so overcome with anger and impatience, that she beat her, at which the girl began to weep loudly  Now at this very moment the queen drove by, and when she heard the weeping she stopped her carriage, went into the house and asked the mother why she was beating her daughter so that the cries could be heard out on the road  Then the woman was ashamed to reveal the laziness of her daughter and said, I cannot get her to leave off spinning  She insists on spinning for ever and ever, and I am poor, and cannot procure the flax  Then answered the queen, there is nothing that I like better to hear than spinning, and I am never happier than when the wheels are humming  Let me have your daughter with me in the palace  I have flax enough, and there she shall spin as much as she likes  The mother was heartily satisfied with this, and the queen took the girl with her  When they had arrived at the palace, she led her up into three rooms which were filled from the bottom to the top with the finest flax  Now spin me this flax, said she, and when you have done it, you shall have my eldest son for a husband, even if you are poor  I care not for that, your untiring industry is dowry enough  The girl was secretly terrified, for she could not have spun the flax, no, not if she had lived till she was three hundred years old, and had sat at it every day from morning till night  When therefore she was alone, she began to weep, and sat thus for three days without moving a finger', " On the third day came the queen, and when she saw that nothing had yet been spun, she was surprised, but the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able to begin because of her great distress at leaving her mother's house", ' The queen was satisfied with this, but said when she was going away, tomorrow you must begin to work  When the girl was alone again, she did not know what to do, and in her distress went to the window  Then she saw three women coming towards her, the first of whom had a broad flat foot, the second had such a great underlip that it hung down over her chin, and the third had a broad thumb  They remained standing before the window, looked up, and asked the girl what was amiss with her  She complained of her trouble, and then they offered her their help and said, if you will invite us to the wedding, not be ashamed of us, and will call us your aunts, and likewise will place us at your table, we will spin up the flax for you, and that in a very short time  With all my heart, she replied, do but come in and begin the work at once  Then she let in the three strange women, and cleared a place in the first room, where they seated themselves and began their spinning  The one drew the thread and trod the wheel, the other wetted the thread, the third twisted it, and struck the table with her finger, and as often as she struck it, a skein of thread fell to the ground that was spun in the finest manner possible  The girl concealed the three spinners from the queen, and showed her whenever she came the great quantity of spun thread, until the latter could not praise her enough  When the first room was empty she went to the second, and at last to the third, and that too was quickly cleared  Then the three women took leave and said to the girl, do not forget what you have promised us - it will make your fortune  When the maiden showed the queen the empty rooms, and the great heap of yarn, she gave orders for the wedding, and the bridegroom rejoiced that he was to have such a clever and industrious wife, and praised her mightily  I have three aunts, said the girl, and as they have been very kind to me, I should not like to forget them in my good fortune, allow me to invite them to the wedding, and let them sit with us at table  The queen and the bridegroom said, why should we not allow that  Therefore when the feast began, the three women entered in strange apparel, and the bride said, welcome, dear aunts' ,  "There was once upon a time a girl who was young and beautiful, but she had lost her mother when she was quite a child, and her step-mother did all she could to make the girl's life wretched", ' Whenever this woman gave her anything to do, she worked at it indefatigably, and did everything that lay in her power  Still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman, she was never satisfied, it was never enough  The harder the girl worked, the more work was put upon her, and all that the woman thought of was how to weigh her down with still heavier burdens, and make her life still more miserable  One day she said to her, here are twelve pounds of feathers which you must pick, and if they are not done this evening, you may expect a good beating  Do you imagine you are to idle away the whole day  The poor girl sat down to the work, but tears ran down her cheeks as she did so, for she saw plainly enough that it was quite impossible to finish the work in one day  Whenever she had a little heap of feathers lying before her, and she sighed or smote her hands together in her anguish, they flew away, and she had to pick them up again, and begin her work anew', " Then she put her elbows on the table, laid her face in her two hands, and cried, is there no one, then, on God's earth to have pity on me", ' Then she heard a low voice which said, be comforted, my child, I have come to help you  The maiden looked up, and an old woman was by her side  She took the girl kindly by the hand, and said, only tell me what is troubling you  As she spoke so kindly, the girl told her of her miserable life, and how one burden after another was laid upon her, and she never could get to the end of the work which was given to her  If I have not done these feathers by this evening, my step-mother will beat me, she has threatened she will, and I know she keeps her word  Her tears began to flow again, but the good old woman said, do not be afraid, my child, rest a while, and in the meantime I will look to your work  The girl lay down on her bed, and soon fell asleep  The old woman seated herself at the table with the feathers, and how they did fly off the quills, which she scarcely touched with her withered hands  The twelve pounds were soon finished, and when the girl awoke, great snow-white heaps were lying, piled up, and everything in the room was neatly cleared away, but the old woman had vanished  The maiden thanked God, and sat still till evening came, when the step-mother came in and marveled to see the work completed  Just look, you awkward creature, said she, what can be done when people are industrious, and why could you not set about something else  There you sit with your hands crossed  When she went out she said, the creature is worth more than her salt  I must give her some work that is still harder  Next morning she called the girl, and said there is a spoon for you  With that you must empty out the great pond which is beside the garden, and if it is not done by night, you know what will happen  The girl took the spoon, and saw that it was full of holes, but even if it had not been, she never could have emptied the pond with it  She set to work at once, knelt down by the water, into which her tears were falling, and began to empty it  But the good old woman appeared again, and when she learnt the cause of her grief, she said, be of good cheer, my child  Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep, I will soon do your work  As soon as the old woman was alone, she barely touched the pond, and a vapor rose up on high from the water, and mingled itself with the clouds There were once two brothers who both served as soldiers, one of them was rich, and the other poor', " Then the poor one, to escape from his poverty, doffed his soldier's coat, and turned farmer", ' He dug and hoed his bit of land, and sowed it with turnip-seed  The seed came up, and one turnip grew there which became large and strong, and visibly grew bigger and bigger, and seemed as if it would never stop growing, so that it might have been called the princess of turnips, for never was such an one seen before, and never will such an one be seen again  At length it was so enormous that by itself it filled a whole cart, and two oxen were required to draw it, and the farmer had not the least idea what he was to do with the turnip, or whether it would be a fortune to him or a misfortune  At last he thought, if you sell it, what will you get for it that is of any importance, and if you eat it yourself, why, the small turnips would do you just as much good  It would be better to take it to the king, and make him a present of it  So he placed it on a cart, harnessed two oxen, took it to the palace, and presented it to the king  What strange thing is this, said the king  Many wonderful things have come before my eyes, but never such a monster as this  From what seed can this have sprung, or are you a favorite of good fortune and have met with it by chance  Ah, no, said the farmer, no favorite am I', " I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier's coat on a nail and took to farming land", ' I have a brother who is rich and well known to you, lord king, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by everyone  Then the king felt compassion for him, and said, you shall be raised from your poverty, and shall have such gifts from me that you shall be equal to your rich brother  Then he bestowed on him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him immensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could not be compared with his  When the rich brother heard what the poor one had gained for himself with one single turnip, he envied him, and thought in every way how he also could come by a similar piece of luck  He set about it in a much more cunning way, however, and took gold and horses and carried them to the king, and made certain the king would give him a much larger present in return  If his brother had got so much for one turnip, what would he not carry away with him in return for such beautiful things as these  The king accepted his present, and said he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and excellent than the great turnip', " So the rich man was obliged to put his brother's turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home", ' There, he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until bad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother  He hired murderers, who were to lie in ambush, and then he went to his brother and said, dear brother, I know of a hidden treasure, we will dig it up together, and divide it between us  The other agreed to this, and accompanied him without suspicion  While they were on their way the murderers fell on him, bound him, and would have hanged him to a tree', " But just as they were doing this, loud singing and the sound of a horse's feet were heard in the distance", ' On this their hearts were filled with terror, and they pushed their prisoner hastily into the sack, hung it on a branch, and took to flight  He, however, worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head  The man who was coming by was no other than a traveling student, a young fellow who rode on his way through the wood joyously singing his song  When he who was aloft saw that someone was passing below him, he cried, good day Three hundred years before the birth of the Lord christ, there lived a mother who had twelve sons, but was so poor and needy that she no longer knew how she was to keep them alive  She prayed to God daily that he would grant that all her sons might be on the earth with the redeemer who was promised  When her necessity became still greater she sent one of them after the other out into the world to seek their bread', " The eldest was called peter, and he went out and had already walked a long way, a whole day's journey, when he came into a great forest", ' He sought for a way out, but could find none, and went farther and farther astray, and at the same time felt such great hunger that he could scarcely stand  At length he became so weak that he was forced to lie down, and he believed death to be at hand  Suddenly there stood beside him a small boy who shone with brightness, and was as beautiful and kind as an angel  The child smote his little hands together, until peter was forced to look up and see him  Then the child said, why are you sitting there in such trouble  Alas  Answered peter, I am going about the world seeking bread, that I may yet see the dear savior who is promised, that is my greatest desire  The child said, come with me, and your wish shall be fulfilled  He took poor peter by the hand, and led him between some cliffs to a great cavern  When they entered it, everything was shining with gold, silver, and crystal, and in the midst of it twelve cradles were standing side by side  Then said the little angel, lie down in the first, and sleep a while, I will rock you  Peter did so, and the angel sang to him and rocked him until he was alseep  And when he was asleep, the second brother came also, guided thither by his guardian angel, and he was rocked to sleep like the first, and thus came the others, one after the other, until all twelve lay there sleeping in the golden cradles  They slept, however, three hundred years, until the night when the savior of the world was born  Then they awoke, and were with him on earth, and were called the twelve apostles   There were once upon a time a king and a queen who lived happily together and had twelve children, but they were all boys  Then said the king to his wife, if the thirteenth child which you are about to bring into the world, is a girl, the twelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great, and that the kingdom may fall to her alone  He even caused twelve coffins to be made, which were already filled with shavings, and in each lay a little death pillow, and he had them taken into a locked-up room, and then he gave the queen the key of it, and bade her not to speak of this to anyone  The mother, however, now sat and lamented all day long, until the youngest son, who was always with her, and whom she had named benjamin, from the bible, said to her, dear mother, why are you so sad  Dearest child, she answered, I may not tell you  But he let her have no rest until she went and unlocked the room, and showed him the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings  Then she said, my dearest benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for you and for your eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into the world, you are all to be killed and buried in them  And as she wept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, weep not, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence  But she said, go forth into the forest with your eleven brothers, and let one sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep watch, looking towards the tower here in the castle  If I give birth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may venture to come back  But if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red flag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the good God protect you  And every night I will rise up and pray for you - in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and in summer that you may not faint away in the heat  After she had blessed her sons therefore, they went forth into the forest  They each kept watch in turn, and sat on the highest oak and looked towards the tower  When eleven days had passed and the turn came to benjamin, he saw that a flag was being raised  It was, however, not the white, but the blood-red flag which announced that they were all to die  When the brothers heard that, they were very angry and said, are we all to suffer death for the sake of a girl  We swear that we will avenge ourselves - wheresoever we find a girl, her red blood shall flow  Thereupon they went deeper into the forest, and in the midst of it, where it was the darkest, they found a little bewitched hut, which was standing empty  Then said they, here we will dwell, and you benjamin, who are the youngest and weakest, you shall stay at home and keep house, we others will go out and fetch food  Then they went into the forest and shot hares, wild deer, birds and pigeons, and whatsoever there was to eat  This they took to benjamin, who had to dress it for them in order that they might appease their hunger  They lived together ten years in the little hut, and the time did not appear long to them  The little daughter which their mother the queen had given birth to, was now grown up  She was good of heart, and fair of face, and had a golden star on her forehead', " Once, on a great washing, she saw twelve men's shirts among the things, and asked her mother, to whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far too small for father", ' Then the queen answered with a heavy heart, dear child, these belong to your twelve brothers  Said the maiden, where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard of them  She replied, God knows where they are, they are wandering about the world  Then she took the maiden and opened the chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the shavings, and the death pillows' ,  "There was once a king's son who had a bride whom he loved very much", ' And when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end  Then he said to his beloved, I must now go and leave you, I give you a ring as a remembrance of me  When I am king, I will return and fetch you  So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death', " He said to him, dear son, I wished to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish, and he named a certain king's daughter who was to be his wife", ' The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said, yes, dear father, your will shall be done, and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died', " When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the king's daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was promised to him", ' His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithlessness that she nearly died  Then her father said to her, dearest child, why are you so sad  You shall have whatsoever you will  She thought for a moment and said, dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size  The father said, if it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled, and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size', " When they came to the king's daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen's clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the huntsmen's clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit", ' Thereupon she took leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly  Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his service', " The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said, yes, and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the king's twelve huntsmen", ' The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things  It came to pass that one evening he said to the king, you think you have twelve huntsmen  Yes, said the king, they are twelve huntsmen  The lion continued, you are mistaken, they are twelve girls  The king said, that cannot be true  How will you prove that to me  Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber, answered swered the lion, and then you will soon see  Men have a firm step, and when they walk over the peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about  The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn', " There was, however, a servant of the king's who favored the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said, the lion wants to make the king believe that you are girls", " Then the king's daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens, show some strength, and step firmly on the peas", ' So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred  Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion, you have lied to me, they walk just like men There were once upon a time two brothers, one rich and the other poor  The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted  The poor one supported himself by making brooms, and was good and honorable  He had two children, who were twin brothers and as like each other as two drops of water  The two boys went in and out of the rich house, and often got some of the scraps to eat  It happened once when the poor man was going into the forest to fetch brush-wood, that he saw a bird which was quite golden and more beautiful than any he had ever chanced to meet with  He picked up a small stone, threw it at it, and was lucky enough to hit it, but one golden feather only fell down, and the bird flew away  The man took the feather and carried it to his brother, who looked at it and said, it is pure gold  And gave him a great deal of money for it  Next day the man climbed into a birch-tree, and was about to cut off a couple of branches when the same bird flew out, and when the man searched he found a nest, and an egg lay inside it, which was of gold  He took the egg home with him, and carried it to his brother, who again said, it is pure gold, and gave him what it was worth  At last the goldsmith said, I should indeed like to have the bird itself  The poor man went into the forest for the third time, and again saw the golden bird sitting on the tree, so he took a stone and brought it down and carried it to his brother, who gave him a great heap of gold for it  Now I can get on, thought he, and went contentedly home  The goldsmith was crafty and cunning, and knew very well what kind of a bird it was  He called his wife and said, roast me the gold bird, and take care that none of it is lost  I have a fancy to eat it all myself  The bird, however, was no common one, but of so wondrous a kind that whosoever ate its heart and liver found every morning a piece of gold beneath his pillow  The woman prepared the bird, put it on the spit, and let it roast  Now it happened that while it was on the fire, and the woman was forced to go out of the kitchen on account of some other work, the two children of the poor broom-maker ran in, stood by the spit and turned it round once or twice  And as at that very moment two little bits of the bird fell down into the pan, one of the boys said, we will eat these two little bits  I am so hungry, and no one will ever miss them  Then the two ate the pieces, but the woman came into the kitchen and saw that they were eating something and said, what have you been eating  Two little morsels which fell out of the bird, answered they  That must have been the heart and the liver, said the woman, quite frightened, and in order that her husband might not miss them and be angry, she quickly killed a young cock, took out his heart and liver, and put them beside the golden bird  When it was ready, she carried it to the goldsmith, who consumed it all alone, and left none of it  Next morning, however, when he felt beneath his pillow, and expected to bring out the piece of gold, no more gold pieces were there than there had always been  The two children did not know what a piece of good-fortune had fallen to their lot  Next morning when they arose, something fell rattling to the ground, and when they picked it up there were two gold pieces  They took them to their father, who was astonished and said, how can that have happened There was once upon a time a king who had a little boy in whose stars it had been foretold that he should be killed by a stag when he was sixteen years of age, and when he had reached that age the huntsmen once went hunting with him', " In the forest, the king's son was separated from the others, and all at once he saw a great stag which he wanted to shoot, but could not hit", ' At length he chased the stag so far that they were quite out of the forest, and then suddenly a great tall man was standing there instead of the stag, and said, "It is well that I have you  I have already ruined six pairs of glass skates with running after you, and have not been able to reach you " Then he took the king\'s son with him, and dragged him through a great lake to a great palace, and he had to sit down to table with him and eat something  When they had eaten something together the king said, "I have three daughters, you must keep watch over the eldest for one night, from nine in the evening till six in the morning, and every time the clock strikes, I will come myself and call, and if you then give me no answer, to-morrow morning you shall be put to death, but if you always give me an answer, you shall have her to wife " When the young folks went to the bedroom there stood a stone image of St  Christopher, and the king\'s daughter said to it, "My father will come at nine o\'clock, and every hour till it strikes three, when he calls, give him an answer instead of the king\'s son " Then the stone image of St  Christopher nodded its head quite quickly, and then more and more slowly till at last it again stood still  The next morning the king said to him, "You have done the business well, but I cannot give my daughter away  You must now watch a night by my second daughter, and then I will consider with myself, whether you can have my eldest daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call you, answer me, and if I call you and you do not reply, your blood shall flow " Then they both went into the sleeping-room, and there stood a still larger stone image of St  Christopher, and the king\'s daughter said to it, "If my father calls, answer him " Then the great stone image of St  Christopher again nodded its head quite quickly and then more and more slowly, until at last it stood still again', " And the king's son lay down on the threshold, put his hand under his head and slept", ' The next morning the king said to him, "You have done the business really well, but I cannot give my daughter away, you must now watch a night by the youngest princess, and then I will consider with myself whether you can have my second daughter to wife  But I shall come every hour myself, and when I call you answer me, and if I call you and you answer not, your blood shall flow for me " Then they once more went to the sleeping-room together, and there was a much greater and much taller image of St  Christopher than the two first had been  The king\'s daughter said to it, "When my father calls, answer " Then the great tall stone image of St  Christopher nodded quite half an hour with its head, until at length the head stood still again', " And the king's son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept", ' The next morning the king said, "You have indeed watched well, but I cannot give you my daughter now, I have a great forest, if you cut it down for me between six o\'clock this morning and six at night, I will think about it " Then he gave him a glass axe, a glass wedge, and a glass mallet  When he got into the wood, he began at once to cut, but the axe broke in two  Then he took the wedge, and struck it once with the mallet, and it became as short and as small as sand  Then he was much troubled and believed he would have to die, and sat down and wept Hill and vale do not meet, but the children of men do, good and bad  In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met on their travels  The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment  He saw the shoemaker coming towards him from the other side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he sang a little mocking song to him,   sew me the seam,   draw me the thread,   spread it over with pitch,   knock the nail on the head  The shoemaker, however, could not bear a joke, he pulled a face as if he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize the tailor by the throat  But the little fellow began to laugh, reached him his bottle, and said, "No harm was meant, take a drink, and swallow your anger down " The shoemaker took a very hearty drink, and the storm on his face began to clear away  He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said, "I took a hearty gulp, they say it comes from much drinking, but not from great thirst  Shall we travel together?" "All right," answered the tailor, "if only it suits you to go into a big town where there is no lack of work " "That is just where I want to go," answered the shoemaker  "In a small hamlet there is nothing to earn, and in the country, people like to go barefoot " They traveled therefore onwards together, and always set one foot before the other like a weasel in the snow  Both of them had time enough, but little to bite and to break', " When they reached a town they went about and paid their respects to the tradesmen, and because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had such fine red cheeks, every one gave him work willingly, and when luck was good the master's daughters gave him a kiss beneath the porch, as well", ' When he again fell in with the shoemaker, the tailor had always the most in his bundle  The ill-tempered shoemaker made a wry face, and thought, the greater the rascal the more the luck  But the tailor began to laugh and to sing, and shared all he got with his comrade  If a couple of pence jingled in his pockets, he ordered good cheer, and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced and it was lightly come, lightly go, with him  When they had traveled for some time, they came to a great forest through which passed the road to the capital  Two foot-paths, however, led through it, one of which was a seven days, journey and the other only two, but neither of the travelers knew which way was the short one  They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree, and took counsel together how they should forecast, and for how many days they should provide themselves with bread  The shoemaker said, "One must look before one leaps, I will take with me bread for a week " "What," said the tailor, "drag bread for seven days on one\'s back like a beast of burden and not be able to look about? I shall trust in God, and not trouble myself about anything  The money I have in my pocket is as good in summer as in winter, but in hot weather bread gets dry, and moldy into the bargain, even my coat does not last as far as it might', " Besides, why should we not find the right way? Bread for two days, and that's enough", '" Each, therefore, bought his own bread, and then they tried their luck in the forest  It was as quiet there as in a church  No wind stirred, no brook murmured, no bird sang, and through the thickly-leaved branches no sunbeam forced its way  The shoemaker spoke never a word, the bread weighed so heavily on his back that the sweat streamed down his cross and gloomy face  The tailor, however, was quite merry, he jumped about, whistled on a leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself, God in heaven must be pleased to see me so happy A man and his wife were once sitting by the door of their house, and they had a roasted chicken set before them, and were about to eat it together  Then the man saw that his aged father was coming, and hastily took the chicken and hid it, for he would not permit him to have any of it  The old man came, took a drink, and went away  Now the son wanted to put the roasted chicken on the table again, but when he took it up, it had become a great toad, which jumped into his face and sat there and never went away again, and if any one wanted to take it off, it looked venomously at him as if it would jump in his face, so that no one would venture to touch it  And the ungrateful son was forced to feed the toad every day, or else it fed itself on his face, and thus he went about the world knowing no rest  ' ,  "One summer's morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window, he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might", ' Then came a peasant woman down the street crying, good jams, cheap  Good jams, cheap', " This rang pleasantly in the tailor's ears, he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called, come up here, dear woman, here you will get rid of your goods", ' The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for him  He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said, the jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence  The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling  Now, this jam shall be blessed by God, cried the little tailor, and give me health and strength  So he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it', " This won't taste bitter, said he, but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite", ' He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches  In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts  HI, who invited you, said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away  The flies, however, who understood no german, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies  The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying, wait, and I will give it to you, struck it mercilessly on them  When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out  Are you a fellow of that sort, said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery  The whole town shall know of this  And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters, seven at one stroke  What, the town, he continued, the whole world shall hear of it', " And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail", ' The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valor  Before he went away, he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him, however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket  In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket  It had to go into his pocket with the cheese  Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue  The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him  The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him, and said, good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the wide-spread world  I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck  Have you any inclination to go with me There was once a king who had an illness, and no one believed that he would come out of it with his life  He had three sons who were much distressed about it, and went down into the palace-garden and wept  There they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief  They told him that their father was so ill that he would most certainly die, for nothing seemed to cure him  Then the old man said, "I know of one more remedy, and that is the water of life  If he drinks of it he will become well again, but it is hard to find " The eldest said, "I will manage to find it " And went to the sick king, and begged to be allowed to go forth in search of the water of life, for that alone could save him  "No," said the king, "the danger of it is too great  I would rather die " But he begged so long that the king consented  The prince thought in his heart, "If I bring the water, then I shall be best beloved of my father, and shall inherit the kingdom " So he set out, and when he had ridden forth a little distance, a dwarf stood there in the road who called to him and said, "Whither away so fast?" "Silly shrimp," said the prince, very haughtily, "it is nothing to do with you " And rode on  But the little dwarf had grown angry, and had wished an evil wish  Soon after this the prince entered a ravine, and the further he rode the closer the mountains drew together, and at last the road became so narrow that he could not advance a step further  It was impossible either to turn his horse or to dismount from the saddle, and he was shut in there as if in prison  The sick king waited long for him, but he came not  Then the second son said, "father, let me go forth to seek the water " And thought to himself, "If my brother is dead, then the kingdom will fall to me " At first the king would not allow him to go either, but at last he yielded, so the prince set out on the same road that his brother had taken, and he too met the dwarf, who stopped him to ask whither he was going in such haste  "Little shrimp," said the prince, "that is nothing to do with you " And rode on without giving him another look  But the dwarf bewitched him, and he, like the other, rode into a ravine, and could neither go forwards nor backwards  So fare haughty people  As the second son also remained away, the youngest begged to be allowed to go forth to fetch the water, and at last the king was obliged to let him go  When he met the dwarf and the latter asked him whither he was going in such haste, he stopped, gave him an explanation, and said, "I am seeking the water of life, for my father is sick unto death " "Do you know, then, where that is to be found?" "No," said the prince  "As you have borne yourself as is seemly, and not haughtily like your false brothers, I will give you the information and tell you how you may obtain the water of life  It springs from a fountain in the courtyard of an enchanted castle, but you will not be able to make your way to it, if I do not give you an iron wand and two small loaves of bread A little brother and sister were once playing by a well, and while they were thus playing, they both fell in  A water-nixie lived down below, who said, now I have got you, now you shall work hard for me, and carried them off with her  She gave the girl dirty tangled flax to spin, and she had to fetch water in a bucket with a hole in it, and the boy had to hew down a tree with a blunt axe, and they got nothing to eat but dumplings as hard as stones  Then at last the children became so impatient, that they waited until one sunday, when the nixie was at church, and ran away  But when church was over, the nixie saw that the birds were flown, and followed them with great strides  The children saw her from afar, and the girl threw a brush behind her which formed an immense hill of bristles, with thousands and thousands of spikes, over which the nixie was forced to scramble with great difficulty, at last, however, she got over  When the children saw this, the boy threw behind him a comb which made a great ridge with a thousand times a thousand teeth, but the nixie managed to keep herself steady on them, and at last crossed over  Then the girl threw behind her a looking-glass which formed a hill of mirrors, and was so slippery that it was impossible for the nixie to cross it  Then she thought, I will go home quickly and fetch my axe, and cut the hill of glass in half  Long before she returned, however, and had hewn through the glass, the children had escaped to a great distance, and the water-nixie was obliged to trundle back to her well again   There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test  He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead  Mrs  Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, miss cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking  When it became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves  The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking  She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said,   what may you be about, miss cat    Do you sleep or do you wake  She answered,   I am not sleeping, I am waking,   would you know what I am making    I am boiling warm beer with butter,   will you be my guest for supper  No, thank you, miss, said the fox, what is mrs  Fox doing  The maid replied,   she is sitting in her room,   moaning in her gloom,   weeping her little eyes quite red,   because old mr  Fox is dead  Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her  Certainly, young sir    The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,   the door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,   mistress fox, are you inside    Oh, yes, my little cat, she cried    A wooer he stands at the door out there    What does he look like, my dear  Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late mr  Fox  Oh, no, answered the cat, he has only one  Then I will not have him  Miss cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away  Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo mrs  Fox  He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first  After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old mr  Fox A woman was walking about the fields with her daughter and her step-daughter cutting fodder, when the Lord came towards them in the form of a poor man, and asked, "Which is the way into the village?" "If you want to know," said the mother, "seek it for yourself," and the daughter added, "If you are afraid you will not find it, take a guide with you " But the step-daughter said, "Poor man, I will take you there, come with me " Then God was angry with the mother and daughter, and turned His back on them, and wished that they should become as black as night and as ugly as sin  To the poor step-daughter, however, God was gracious, and went with her, and when they were near the village, He said a blessing over her, and spoke, "Choose three things for yourself, and I will grant them to you " Then said the maiden, "I should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun," and instantly she was white and fair as day  "Then I should like to have a purse of money which would never grow empty " That the Lord gave her also, but He said, "Do not forget what is best of all " Said she, "For my third wish, I desire, after my death, to inhabit the eternal kingdom of heaven " That also was granted unto her, and then the Lord left her  When the step-mother came home with her daughter, and they saw that they were both as black as coal and ugly, but that the step-daughter was white and beautiful, wickedness increased still more in their hearts, and they thought of nothing else but how they could do her an injury  The step-daughter, however, had a brother called Reginer, whom she loved much, and she told him all that had happened  And Reginer said to her, "Dear sister, I will paint your portrait, that I may continually see you before my eyes, for my love for you is so great that I should like always to look at you " Then she answered, "But, I pray you, let no one see the picture " So he painted his sister and hung up the picture in his room, he, however, dwelt in the king\'s palace, for he was his coachman  Every day he went and stood before the picture, and thanked God for the happiness of having such a dear sister  Now it happened that the king whom he served, had just lost his wife, who had been so beautiful that no one could be found to compare with her, and on this account the king was in deep grief  The attendants about the court, however, noticed that the coachman stood daily before this beautiful picture, and they were jealous of him, so they informed the king  Then the latter ordered the picture to be brought to him, and when he saw that it was like his lost wife in every respect, except that it was still more beautiful, he fell mortally in love with it He caused the coachman to be brought before him, and asked whom the portrait represented  The coachman said it was his sister, so the king resolved to take no one but her as his wife, and gave him a carriage and horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold, and sent him forth to fetch his chosen bride  When Reginer came on this errand, his sister was glad, but the black maiden was jealous of her good fortune, and grew angry above all measure, and said to her mother, "Of what use are all your arts to us now when you cannot procure such a piece of luck for me " "Be quiet," said the old woman, "I will soon divert it to you," - and by her arts of witchcraft, she so troubled the eyes of the coachman that he was half-blind, and she stopped the ears of the white maiden so that she was half-deaf  Then they got into the carriage, first the bride in her noble royal apparel, then the step-mother with her daughter, and Reginer sat on the box to drive  When they had been on the way for some time the coachman cried, \t "Cover thee well, my sister dear, \t That the rain may not wet thee, \t That the wind may not load thee with dust, \t That thou may\'st be fair and beautiful \t When thou appearest before the king " The bride asked, "What is my dear brother saying?" "Ah," said the old woman, "he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give it to your sister " Then she took it off, and put it on the black maiden, who gave her in exchange for it a shabby grey gown  They drove onwards, and a short time afterwards, the brother again cried, \t "Cover thee well, my sister dear, \t That the rain may not wet thee, \t That the wind may not load thee with dust, \t That thou may\'st be fair and beautiful \t When thou appearest before the king " The bride asked, "What is my dear brother saying?" "Ah," said the old woman, "he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it to your sister " So she took off the hood and put it on her sister, and sat with her own head uncovered  And they drove on farther  After a while, the brother once more cried, \t "Cover thee well, my sister dear, \t That the rain may not wet thee, \t That the wind may not load thee with dust, \t That thou may\'st be fair and beautiful \t When thou appearest before the king A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land  Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air  But he had a strange custom, every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish  It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone  This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room  When he had carefully locked the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish  But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut off a little bit and put it into his mouth  No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window  He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods  Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals  Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere  The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed  In vain he declared his innocence, he was dismissed with no better answer  In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble  Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest, and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together  The servant stood by and listened', " They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found, and one said in a pitiful tone, something lies heavy on my stomach, as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen's window", ' The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook, here is a fine duck, pray, kill her  Yes, said the cook, and weighed her in his hand, she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long enough', " So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen's ring was found inside her", ' The servant could now easily prove his innocence, and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favor, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for  The servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for traveling, as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little  When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water  Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water  They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him, we will remember you and repay you for saving us  He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet  He listened, and heard an ant-king complain, why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies  That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without mercy  So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him, we will remember you - one good turn deserves another  The path led him into a wood, and here he saw two old ravens standing by their nest, and throwing out their young ones Once upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not do what her mother wished  For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short time she lay on her death-bed  When she had been lowered into her grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out again  Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground   Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said, "Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?" "That is the king of birds," said the wolf, "before whom we must bow down " In reality the bird was the willow-wren  "If that\'s the case," said the bear, "I should very much like to see his royal palace, come, take me thither " "That is not done quite as you seem to think," said the wolf, "you must wait until the queen comes " Soon afterwards the queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord king came too, and they began to feed their young ones  The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said, no, you must wait until the lord and lady queen have gone away again  So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away  The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again  The king and queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there  "Is that the royal palace," cried the bear, "it is a wretched palace, and you are not king\'s children, you are disreputable children " When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed, "No, that we are not  Our parents are honest people  Bear, you will have to pay for that " The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes  The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said, "We will not so much as touch one fly\'s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not, the bear has been here and has insulted us " Then the old king said, "Be easy, he shall be punished," and he at once flew with the queen to the bear\'s cave, and called in, "Old growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall suffer for it - we will punish you by a bloody war " Thus war was announced to the bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained  And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come', " When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy's commander-in-chief", ' The gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced  There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said, "Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be general and lead us " "Good," said the fox, "but what signal shall we agree upon?" No one knew that, so the fox said, "I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers  When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge, but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can " When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren  When day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled  The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other', " But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox's tail, and sting with all his might", ' When the fox felt the first sting, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air, at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment, at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs  When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle  Then the king and queen flew home to their children and cried, "Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\'s content, we have won the battle In olden times every sound still had its meaning and significance  When the smith\'s hammer resounded, it cried, "Strike away, strike away " When the carpenter\'s plane grated, it said, "Here goes, here goes " If the mill wheel began to clack, it said, "Help, Lord God, help, Lord God " And if the miller was a cheat and set the mill a-going, it spoke high german, and first asked slowly, "Who is there? Who is there?" And then answered quickly, "The miller, the miller " And at last quite in a hurry, "He steals bravely, He steals bravely, three pecks in a bushel " At this time the birds also had their own language which every one understood  Now it only sounds like chirping, screeching, and whistling, and sometimes like music without words', " It came into the birds' mind, however, that they would no longer be without a ruler, and would choose one of themselves to be their king", ' One alone among them, the green plover, was opposed to this  He had lived free and would die free, and anxiously flying hither and thither, he cried, "Where shall I go? Where shall I go?" He retired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself no more among his fellows  The birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine may morning they all gathered together from the woods and fields, eagles and chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how can I name them all  Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his clerk, who is so called because he is always heard a few days before him, and a very small bird which as yet had no name, mingled with the band  The hen, which by some accident had heard nothing of the whole matter, was astonished at the great assemblage  What, what, what is going to be done, she cackled  But the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said, only a lot of rich people, and told her what they had on hand  It was decided that the one who could fly the highest should be king  A tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard that, cried a warning, no, no, no, no, because he thought that many tears would be shed because of this  But the crow said, caw, caw, and that all would pass off peaceably  It was now determined that on this fine morning they should at once begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able to say, I could easily have flown much higher, but the evening came on, and I could do no more  On a given signal, therefore, the whole troop rose up in the air  The dust ascended from the land, and there was tremendous fluttering and whirring and beating of wings, and it looked as if a black cloud was rising up  The little birds were soon left behind  They could go no farther, and fell back to the ground  The larger birds held out longer, but none could equal the eagle, who mounted so high that he could have plucked the eyes out of the sun  And when he saw that the others could not get up to him, he thought, why should you fly still higher  You are the king, and began to let himself down again  The birds beneath him at once cried to him, you must be our king, no one has flown so high as you  Except me, screamed the little fellow without a name, who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle  And as he was not at all tired, he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself How fortunate is the master, and how well all goes in his house, when he has a wise servant who listens to his orders and does not obey them, but prefers following his own wisdom  A clever Hans of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow  He stayed away a long time, and the master thought, faithful Hans does not spare any pains over his work  But when he did not come back at all, the master was afraid lest some misfortune had befallen him, and set out himself to look for him  He had to search a long time, but at last he caught sight of the boy running up and down a large field  Now, dear Hans, said the master when he had got up to him, have you found the cow which I sent you to seek  No, master, he answered, I have not found the cow, but then I have not looked for it  Then what have you looked for, Hans  Three blackbirds, answered the boy  And where are they, asked the master  I see one of them, I hear the other, and I am running after the third, answered the wise boy  Take example by this, do not trouble yourselves about your masters or their orders, but rather do what comes into your head and pleases you, and then you will act just as wisely as clever Hans   There was once upon a time a tailor who had three sons, and only one goat  But as the goat supported all of them with her milk, she was obliged to have good food, and to be taken every day to pasture  The sons did this, in turn  Once the eldest took her to the churchyard, where the finest herbs were to be found, and let her eat and run about there  At night when it was time to go home he asked, goat, have you had enough', " The goat answered   I have eaten so much,   not a leaf more I'll touch, meh", ' Meh  Come home, then, said the youth, and took hold of the cord round her neck, led her into the stable and tied her up securely  Well, said the old tailor, has the goat had as much food as she ought', " Oh, answered the son, she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she'll touch", ' But the father wished to satisfy himself, and went down to the stable, stroked the dear animal and asked, goat, are you satisfied  The goat answered,   how should I be satisfied    Among the ditches I leapt about,   found no leaf, so went without, meh  Meh  What do I hear, cried the tailor, and ran upstairs and said to the youth  HI, you liar, you said the goat had had enough, and have let her hunger, and in his anger he took the yard-measure from the wall, and drove him out with blows  Next day it was the turn of the second son, who sought a place in the fence of the garden, where nothing but good herbs grew, and the goat gobbled them all up  At night when he wanted to go home, he asked, goat, are you satisfied', " The goat answered,   I have eaten so much,   not a leaf more I'll touch, meh", ' Meh  Come home, then, said the youth, and led her home, and tied her up in the stable  Well, said the old tailor, has the goat had as much food as she ought', " Oh, answered the son, she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she'll touch", ' The tailor would not rely on this, but went down to the stable and said, goat, have you had enough  The goat answered,   how should I be satisfied    Among the ditches I leapt about,   found no leaf, so went without, meh  Meh  The godless wretch  Cried the tailor, to let such a good animal hunger, and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the yard-measure  Now came the turn of the third son, who wanted to do his duty well, and sought out some bushes with the finest leaves, and let the goat devour them The wolf had the fox with him, and whatsoever the wolf wished, that the fox was compelled to do, for he was the weaker, and he would gladly have been rid of his master  It chanced that once as they were going through the forest, the wolf said, red-fox, get me something to eat, or else I will eat you yourself  Then the fox answered, I know a farm-yard where there are two young lambs  If you are inclined, we will fetch one of them  That suited the wolf, and they went thither, and the fox stole the little lamb, took it to the wolf, and went away  The wolf devoured it, but was not satisfied with one  He wanted the other as well, and went to get it  But as he did it so clumsily, the mother of the little lamb heard him, and began to cry out terribly, and to bleat so that the farmers came running there  They found the wolf, and beat him so mercilessly, that he went to the fox limping and howling  You have misled me finely, said he  I wanted to fetch the other lamb, and the country folks surprised me, and have beaten me to a jelly  The fox replied, why are you such a glutton  Next day they again went into the country, and the greedy wolf once more said, red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat you yourself  Then answered the fox, I know a farm-house where the wife is baking pancakes to-night  We will get some of them for ourselves  They went there, and the fox slipped round the house, and peeped and sniffed about until he discovered where the dish was, and then snatched six pancakes and carried them to the wolf  There is something for you to eat, said he to him, and then went his way  The wolf swallowed down the pancakes in an instant, and said, they make one want more, and went thither and tore the whole dish down so that it broke in pieces  This made such a great noise that the woman came out, and when she saw the wolf she called the people, who hurried there, and beat him as long as their sticks would hold together, till with two lame legs, and howling loudly, he returned to the fox in the forest  How abominably you have misled me, cried he, the peasants caught me, and tanned my skin for me  But the fox replied, why are you such a glutton  On the third day, when they were out together, and the wolf could only limp along painfully, he again said, red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat your yourself  The fox answered, I know a man who has been killing, and the salted meat is lying in a barrel in the cellar  We will get that  Said the wolf, I will go when you do, that you may help me if I am not able to get away  I am willing, said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar  There was meat in abundance, and the wolf attacked it instantly and thought, there is plenty of time before I need leave off  The fox liked it also, but looked about everywhere, and often ran to the hole by which they had come in, to find out if his body was still thin enough to slip through it  The wolf said, dear fox, tell me why you are running here and there so much, and jumping in and out  I must see that no one is coming, replied the crafty fellow Once upon a time the fox was talking to the wolf of the strength of man  How no animal could withstand him, and how all were obliged to emply cunning in order to protect themselves from him  Then the wolf answered, if I had but the chance of seeing a man for once, I would set on him notwithstanding  I can help you to do that, said the fox  Come to me early to-morrow morning, and I will show you one  The wolf presented himself betimes, and the fox took him out on the road by which the huntsmen went daily  First came an old discharged soldier  Is that a man, inquired the wolf  No, answered the fox, that was one  Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school  Is that a man  No, that will be one  At length came a hunter with his double-barelled gun at his back, and hanger by his side  Said the fox to the wolf, look, there comes a man, you must attack him, but I will take myself off to my hole  The wolf then rushed on the man  When the huntsman saw him he said, it is a pity that I have not loaded with a bullet, aimed, and fired his small shot in his face  The wolf pulled a very wry grimace, but did not let himself be frightened, and attacked him again, on which the huntsman gave him the second barrel  The wolf swallowed his pain, and rushed on the huntsman, but he drew out his bright hanger, and gave him a few cuts with it right and left, so that, bleeding everywhere, he ran howling back to the fox  Well, brother wolf, said the fox, how have you got on with man  Ah, replied the wolf, I never imagined the strength of man to be what it is  First, he took a stick from his shoulder, and blew into it, and then something flew into my face which tickled me terribly  Then he breathed once more into the stick, and it flew into my nose like lightning and hail  When I was quite close, he drew a white rib out of his body, and he beat me so with it that I was all but left lying dead  See what a braggart you are, said the fox  You throw your hatchet so far that you cannot fetch it back again   There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children  One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food  So she called all seven to her and said, dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he will devour you all - skin, hair, and everything  The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet  The kids said, dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves, you may go away without any anxiety  Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind  It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called, open the door, dear children, your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you  But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice  We will not open the door, cried they, you are not our mother  She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough, you are the wolf  Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it  The he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called, open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you  But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried, we will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you, you are the wolf  Then the wolf ran to a baker and said, I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me  And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said, strew some white meal over my feet for me  The miller thought to himself, the wolf wants to deceive someone, and refused, but the wolf said, if you will not do it, I will devour you  Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him  Truly, this the way of mankind  So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said, open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her  The little kids cried, first show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother  Then he put his paws in through the window, and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door  But who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to hide themselves  One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case  But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony, one after the other he swallowed them down his throat  The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find  When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep  Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest  Ah  What a sight she saw there  The house-door stood wide open There was once a wonderful musician, who went quite forlorn through a forest and thought of all manner of things, and when nothing was left for him to think about, he said to himself, time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither a good companion for myself  Then he took his fiddle from his back, and played so that it echoed through the trees  It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him  Ah, here is a wolf coming  I have no desire for him, said the musician but the wolf came nearer and said to him, ah, dear musician, how beautifully you play  I should like to learn that, too  It is soon learnt, the musician replied, you have only to do all that I bid you  Oh, musician, said the wolf, I will obey you as a scholar obeys his master  The musician bade him follow, and when they had gone part of the way together, they came to an old oak-tree which was hollow inside, and cleft in the middle  Look, said the musician, if you will learn to fiddle, put your fore paws into this crevice  The wolf obeyed, but the musician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his two paws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner  Wait there until I come back again, said the musician, and went his way  After a while he again said to himself, time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion, and took his fiddle and again played in the forest  It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him', " Ah, there's a fox coming, said the musician", ' I have no desire for him  The fox came up to him and said, oh, dear musician, how beautifully you play  I should like to learn that too  That is soon learnt, said the musician  You have only to do everything that I bid you  Oh, musician, then said the fox, I will obey you as a scholar obeys his master  Follow me, said the musician, and when they had walked a part of the way, they came to a footpath, with high bushes on both sides of it  There the musician stood still, and from one side bent a young hazel-bush down to the ground, and put his foot on the end of it  Then he bent down a young tree from the other side as well, and said, now little fox, if you will learn something, give me your left front paw  The fox obeyed, and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough  Little fox, said he, now reach me your right paw  And he tied it to the right bough  When he had examined whether the knots were firm enough, he let go, and the bushes sprang up again, and jerked up the little fox, so that it hung struggling in the air  Wait there till I come back again, said the musician, and went on his way  Again he said to himself, time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion' ,  "Once upon a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb, and did not become any bigger, and during several years did not grow one hair's breadth", ' Once when the father was going out to plough, the little one said, father, I will go out with you  You would go out with me, said the father  Stay here, you will be of no use out there, besides you might get lost  Then thumbling began to cry, and for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket, and took him with him  When he was outside in the field, he took him out again, and set him in a freshly cut furrow  Whilst he sat there, a great giant came over the hill  Do you see that great bogie, said the father, for he wanted to frighten the little fellow to make him behave well, he is coming to fetch you  The giant, however, had scarcely taken two steps with his long legs before he was in the furrow  He took up little thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him, and without saying one word went away with him  His father stood by, but could not utter a sound for terror, and he thought nothing else but that his child was lost, and that as long as he lived he should never set eyes on him again  But the giant carried him home, let him suckle at his breast, and thumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants  When two years had passed, the old giant took him into the forest, wanted to test him, and said, pull up a stick for yourself  Then the boy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots  But the giant thought, we must do better than that, took him back again, and suckled him two years longer  When he tested him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground  That was still not enough for the giant, he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, now just tear up a real stick, the boy tore up the biggest oak-tree from the earth, so that it cracked, and that was a mere trifle to him  Now that will do, said the giant, you are perfect  And took him back to the field from whence he had brought him  His father was there following the plough  The young giant went up to him, and said, does my father see what a fine man his son has grown into  The farmer was alarmed, and said, no, you are not my son', " I don't want you - leave me", ' Truly I am your son, allow me to do your work, I can plough as well as you, nay better  No, no, you are not my son, and you can not plough - go away  However, as he was afraid of this great man, he let go of the plough, stepped back and sat down at the side of the land  Then the youth took the plough, and just grasped it with one hand, but his pressure was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth  The farmer could not bear to see that, and called to him, if you are determined to plough, you must not press so hard on it, that makes bad work  The youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the plough himself, saying, just go home, father, and bid my mother make ready a large dish of food, and in the meantime I will go over the field  Then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare the food, but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large, quite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and harrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once  I   The Abbot of Inisfalen awoke ere dawn of day;  Under the dewy green leaves went he forth to pray,  The lake around his island lay smooth and dark and deep,  And wrapt in a misty stillness the mountains were all asleep', "  Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac when the dawn was dim and gray;  The prayers of his holy office he faithfully 'gan to say", "  Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac while the dawn was waxing red;  And for his sins' forgiveness a solemn prayer he said;  Low kneel'd that holy Abbot while the dawn was waxing clear;  And he pray'd with loving-kindness for his convent-brethren dear", "  Low kneel'd that blessed Abbot while the dawn was waxing bright;  He pray'd a great prayer for Ireland, he pray'd with all his might", "  Low kneel'd that good old Father while the sun began to dart;  He pray'd a prayer for all men, he pray'd it from his heart", "  His blissful soul was in Heaven, tho' a breathing man was he;  He was out of Time's dominion, so far as the living may be", ' II   The Abbot of Inisfalen arose upon his feet;  He heard a small bird singing, and O but it sung sweet!  It sung upon a holly-bush, this little snow-white bird;  A song so full of gladness he never before had heard   It sung upon a hazel, it sung upon a thorn;  He had never heard such music since the hour that he was born   It sung upon a sycamore, it sung upon a briar;  To follow the song and hearken this Abbot could never tire   Till at last he well bethought him; he might no longer stay;  So he blessed the little white singing-bird, and gladly went his way  III   But, when he came to his Abbey, he found a wondrous change;  He saw no friendly faces there, for every face was strange   The strange men spoke unto him; and he heard from all and each  The foreign tongue of the Sassenach, not wholesome Irish speech   Then the oldest monk came forward, in Irish tongue spake he:  "Thou wearest the holy Augustine\'s dress, and who hath given it to thee?"  "I wear the holy Augustine\'s dress, and Cormac is my name,  The Abbot of this good Abbey by grace of God I am', "  I went forth to pray, at the dawn of day; and when my prayers were said,  I hearken'd awhile to a little bird that sung above my head", '"  The monks to him made answer, "Two hundred years have gone o\'er,  Since our Abbot Cormac went through the gate, and never was heard of   more', "  Matthias now is our Abbot, and twenty have pass'd away", '  The stranger is lord of Ireland; we live in an evil day "  "Days will come and go," he said, "and the world will pass away,  In Heaven a day is a thousand years, a thousand years are a day " IV   "Now, give me absolution; for my time is come," said he   And they gave him absolution as speedily as might be', "  Then, close outside the window, the sweetest song they heard  That ever yet since the world began was utter'd by any bird", "  The monks look'd out and saw the bird, its feathers all white and clean;  And there in a moment, beside it, another white bird was seen", '  Those two they sang together, waved their white wings, and fled;  Flew aloft, and vanished; but the good old man was dead   They buried his blessed body where lake and greensward meet;  A carven cross above his head, a holly-bush at his feet;  Where spreads the beautiful water to gay or cloudy skies,  And the purple peaks of Killarney from ancient woods arise   ' ,  " In a country which is full of wild beasts of all sorts there once lived a jackal and a hedgehog, and, unlike though they were, the two animals made great friends, and were often seen in each other's company", " One afternoon they were walking along a road together, when the jackal, who was the taller of the two, exclaimed: 'Oh! there is a barn full of corn; let us go and eat some", "' 'Yes, do let us!' answered the hedgehog", ' So they went to the barn, and ate till they could eat no more  Then the jackal put on his shoes, which he had taken off so as to make no noise, and they returned to the high road', " After they had gone some way they met a panther, who stopped, and bowing politely, said: 'Excuse my speaking to you, but I cannot help admiring those shoes of yours", " Do you mind telling me who made them?' 'Yes, I think they are rather nice,' answered the jackal; 'I made them myself, though", "' 'Could you make me a pair like them?' asked the panther eagerly", " 'I would do my best, of course,' replied the jackal; 'but you must kill me a cow, and when we have eaten the flesh I will take the skin and make your shoes out of it", "' So the panther prowled about until he saw a fine cow grazing apart from the rest of the herd", ' He killed it instantly, and then gave a cry to the jackal and hedgehog to come to the place where he was  They soon skinned the dead beasts, and spread its skin out to dry, after which they had a grand feast before they curled themselves up for the night, and slept soundly  Next morning the jackal got up early and set to work upon the shoes, while the panther sat by and looked on with delight  At last they were finished, and the jackal arose and stretched himself', " 'Now go and lay them in the sun out there,' said he; 'in a couple of hours they will be ready to put on; but do not attempt to wear them before, or you will feel them most uncomfortable", ' But I see the sun is high in the heavens, and we must be continuing our journey', "' The panther, who always believed what everybody told him, did exactly as he was bid, and in two hours' time began to fasten on the shoes", ' They certainly set off his paws wonderfully, and he stretched out his forepaws and looked at them with pride  But when he tried to walk--ah! that was another story! They were so stiff and hard that he nearly shrieked every step he took, and at last he sank down where he was, and actually began to cry', " After some time some little partridges who were hopping about heard the poor panther's groans, and went up to see what was the matter", ' He had never tried to make his dinner off them, and they had always been quite friendly', " 'You seem in pain,' said one of them, fluttering close to him, 'can we help you?' 'Oh, it is the jackal! He made me these shoes; they are so hard and tight that they hurt my feet, and I cannot manage to kick them off", "' 'Lie still, and we will soften them,' answered the kind little partridge", ' And calling to his brothers, they all flew to the nearest spring, and carried water in their beaks, which they poured over the shoes  This they did till the hard leather grew soft, and the panther was able to slip his feet out of them', " 'Oh, thank you, thank you,' he cried, skipping round with joy", " 'I feel a different creature", ' Now I will go after the jackal and pay him my debts', "' And he bounded away into the forest", ' But the jackal had been very cunning, and had trotted backwards and forwards and in and out, so that it was very difficult to know which track he had really followed  On the shores of the west, where the great hills stand with their feet in the sea, dwelt a goatherd and his wife, together with their three sons and one daughter  All day long the young men fished and hunted, while their sister took out the kids to pasture on the mountain, or stayed at home helping her mother and mending the nets  For several years they all lived happily together, when one day, as the girl was out on the hill with the kids, the sun grew dark and an air cold as a thick white mist came creeping, creeping up from the sea  She rose with a shiver, and tried to call to her kids, but the voice died away in her throat, and strong arms seemed to hold her  Loud were the wails in the hut by the sea when the hours passed on and the maiden came not  Many times the father and brothers jumped up, thinking they heard her steps, but in the thick darkness they could scarcely see their own hands, nor could they tell where the river lay, nor where the mountain  One by one the kids came home, and at every bleat someone hurried to open the door, but no sound broke the stillness  Through the night no one slept, and when morning broke and the mist rolled back, they sought the maiden by sea and by land, but never a trace of her could be found anywhere  Thus a year and a day slipped by, and at the end of it Gorla of the Flocks and his wife seemed suddenly to have grown old  Their sons too were sadder than before, for they loved their sister well, and had never ceased to mourn for her', " At length Ardan the eldest spoke and said: 'It is now a year and a day since our sister was taken from us, and we have waited in grief and patience for her to return", ' Surely some evil has befallen her, or she would have sent us a token to put our hearts at rest; and I have vowed to myself that my eyes shall not know sleep till, living or dead, I have found her', "' 'If you have vowed, then must you keep your vow,' answered Gorla", " 'But better had it been if you had first asked your father's leave before you made it", ' Yet, since it is so, your mother will bake you a cake for you to carry with you on your journey', " Who can tell how long it may be?' So the mother arose and baked not one cake but two, a big one and a little one", " 'Choose, my son,' said she", " 'Will you have the little cake with your mother's blessing, or the big one without it, in that you have set aside your father and taken on yourself to make a vow?' 'I will have the large cake,' answered the youth; 'for what good would my mother's blessing do for me if I was dying of hunger?' And taking the big cake he went his way", ' Straight on he strode, letting neither hill nor river hinder him  Swiftly he walked-- swiftly as the wind that blew down the mountain  The eagles and the gulls looked on from their nests as he passed, leaving the deer behind him; but at length he stopped, for hunger had seized on him, and he could walk no more  Trembling with fatigue he sat himself on a rock and broke a piece off his cake', " 'Spare me a morsel, Ardan son of Gorla,' asked a raven, fluttering down towards him", " 'Seek food elsewhere, O bearer of ill-news,' answered Ardan son of Gorla; 'it is but little I have for myself", "' And he stretched himself out for a few moments, then rose to his feet again", ' On and on went he till the little birds flew to their nests, and the brightness died out of the sky, and a darkness fell over the earth  On and on, and on, till at last he saw a beam of light streaming from a house and hastened towards it  The door was opened and he entered, but paused when he beheld an old man lying on a bench by the fire, while seated opposite him was a maiden combing out the locks of her golden hair with a comb of silver', " 'Welcome, fair youth,' said the old man, turning his head", " 'Sit down and warm yourself, and tell me how fares the outer world" ,  " The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid sat in his palace, wondering if there was anything left in the world that could possibly give him a few hours' amusement, when Giafar the grand-vizir, his old and tried friend, suddenly appeared before him", ' Bowing low, he waited, as was his duty, till his master spoke, but Haroun-al-Raschid merely turned his head and looked at him, and sank back into his former weary posture  Now Giafar had something of importance to say to the Caliph, and had no intention of being put off by mere silence, so with another low bow in front of the throne, he began to speak  "Commander of the Faithful," said he, "I have taken on myself to remind your Highness that you have undertaken secretly to observe for yourself the manner in which justice is done and order is kept throughout the city  This is the day you have set apart to devote to this object, and perhaps in fulfilling this duty you may find some distraction from the melancholy to which, as I see to my sorrow, you are a prey " "You are right," returned the Caliph, "I had forgotten all about it  Go and change your coat, and I will change mine " A few moments later they both re-entered the hall, disguised as foreign merchants, and passed through a secret door, out into the open country  Here they turned towards the Euphrates, and crossing the river in a small boat, walked through that part of the town which lay along the further bank, without seeing anything to call for their interference  Much pleased with the peace and good order of the city, the Caliph and his vizir made their way to a bridge, which led straight back to the palace, and had already crossed it, when they were stopped by an old and blind man, who begged for alms  The Caliph gave him a piece of money, and was passing on, but the blind man seized his hand, and held him fast  "Charitable person," he said, "whoever you may be grant me yet another prayer  Strike me, I beg of you, one blow  I have deserved it richly, and even a more severe penalty " The Caliph, much surprised at this request, replied gently: "My good man, that which you ask is impossible  Of what use would my alms be if I treated you so ill?" And as he spoke he tried to loosen the grasp of the blind beggar  "My lord," answered the man, "pardon my boldness and my persistence  Take back your money, or give me the blow which I crave  I have sworn a solemn oath that I will receive nothing without receiving chastisement, and if you knew all, you would feel that the punishment is not a tenth part of what I deserve " Moved by these words, and perhaps still more by the fact that he had other business to attend to, the Caliph yielded, and struck him lightly on the shoulder  Then he continued his road, followed by the blessing of the blind man  When they were out of earshot, he said to the vizir, "There must be something very odd to make that man act so--I should like to find out what is the reason  Go back to him; tell him who I am, and order him to come without fail to the palace to-morrow, after the hour of evening prayer " So the grand-vizir went back to the bridge; gave the blind beggar first a piece of money and then a blow, delivered the Caliph\'s message, and rejoined his master  They passed on towards the palace, but walking through a square, they came upon a crowd watching a young and well-dressed man who was urging a horse at full speed round the open space, using at the same time his spurs and whip so unmercifully that the animal was all covered with foam and blood  The Caliph, astonished at this proceeding, inquired of a passer-by what it all meant, but no one could tell him anything, except that every day at the same hour the same thing took place  Still wondering, he passed on, and for the moment had to content himself with telling the vizir to command the horseman also to appear before him at the same time as the blind man  The next day, after evening prayer, the Caliph entered the hall, and was followed by the vizir bringing with him the two men of whom we have spoken, and a third, with whom we have nothing to do  They all bowed themselves low before the throne and then the Caliph bade them rise, and ask the blind man his name  "Baba-Abdalla, your Highness," said he  Long, long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki  Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her  Not long after this, through the malice of some of his friends, he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed  This misfortune so preyed upon his mind that he did not long survive his dismissal--he died, leaving behind him his beautiful young wife to face the world alone', " Fearing her husband's enemies, she fled to the Ashigara Mountains as soon as her husband was dead, and there in the lonely forests where no one ever came except woodcutters, a little boy was born to her", ' She called him Kintaro or the Golden Boy  Now the remarkable thing about this child was his great strength, and as he grew older he grew stronger and stronger, so that by the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as quickly as the woodcutters  Then his mother gave him a large ax, and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters, who called him "Wonder-child," and his mother the "Old Nurse of the Mountains," for they did not know her high rank', " Another favorite pastime of Kintaro's was to smash up rocks and stones", ' You can imagine how strong he was! Quite unlike other boys, Kintaro, grew up all alone in the mountain wilds, and as he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk  By degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon Kintaro as their master, and he used them as his servants and messengers  But his special retainers were the bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare  The bear often brought her cubs for Kintaro to romp with, and when she came to take them home Kintaro would get on her back and have a ride to her cave', " He was very fond of the deer too, and would often put his arms round the creature's neck to show that its long horns did not frighten him", ' Great was the fun they all had together  One day, as usual, Kintaro went up into the mountains, followed by the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare  After walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads, they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers  Here, indeed, was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together  The deer rubbed his horns against a tree for pleasure, the monkey scratched his back, the hare smoothed his long ears, and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction  Kintaro said, "Here is a place for a good game  What do you all say to a wrestling match?" The bear being the biggest and the oldest, answered for the others: "That will be great fun," said she  "I am the strongest animal, so I will make the platform for the wrestlers;" and she set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape  "All right," said Kintaro, "I will look on while you all wrestle with each other  I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round " "What fun! we shall all try to get the prize," said the bear  The deer, the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which they were all to wrestle  When this was finished, Kintaro cried out: "Now begin! the monkey and the hare shall open the sports and the deer shall be umpire  Now, Mr  Deer, you are to be umpire!" "He, he!" answered the deer  "I will be umpire  How it happened that Mastro Cherry, carpenter, found a piece of wood that wept and laughed like a child  Centuries ago there lived-- "A king!" my little readers will say immediately  No, children, you are mistaken  Once upon a time there was a piece of wood  It was not an expensive piece of wood  Far from it  Just a common block of firewood, one of those thick, solid logs that are put on the fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm  I do not know how this really happened, yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter  His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called him Mastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry  As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy  Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself: "This has come in the nick of time  I shall use it to make the leg of a table " He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood  But as he was about to give it the first blow, he stood still with arm uplifted, for he had heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone: "Please be careful! Do not hit me so hard!" What a look of surprise shone on Mastro Cherry\'s face! His funny face became still funnier  He turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee, little voice had come from and he saw no one! He looked under the bench--no one! He peeped inside the closet--no one! He searched among the shavings--no one! He opened the door to look up and down the street--and still no one! "Oh, I see!" he then said, laughing and scratching his Wig  "It can easily be seen that I only thought I heard the tiny voice say the words! Well, well--to work once more " He struck a most solemn blow upon the piece of wood  "Oh, oh! You hurt!" cried the same far-away little voice  Mastro Cherry grew dumb, his eyes popped out of his head, his mouth opened wide, and his tongue hung down on his chin  As soon as he regained the use of his senses, he said, trembling and stuttering from fright: "Where did that voice come from, when there is no one around? Might it be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child? I can hardly believe it  Here it is--a piece of common firewood, good only to burn in the stove, the same as any other  Yet--might someone be hidden in it? If so, the worse for him  I\'ll fix him!" With these words, he grabbed the log with both hands and started to knock it about unmercifully  He threw it to the floor, against the walls of the room, and even up to the ceiling  He listened for the tiny voice to moan and cry  He waited two minutes--nothing; five minutes--nothing; ten minutes--nothing  "Oh, I see," he said, trying bravely to laugh and ruffling up his wig with his hand  "It can easily be seen I only imagined I heard the tiny voice! Well, well--to work once more!" The poor fellow was scared half to death, so he tried to sing a gay song in order to gain courage  He set aside the hatchet and picked up the plane to make the wood smooth and even, but as he drew it to and fro, he heard the same tiny voice  This time it giggled as it spoke: "Stop it! Oh, stop it! Ha, ha, ha! You tickle my stomach  Now, though the jackal was dead, he had left two sons behind him, every whit as cunning and tricky as their father  The elder of the two was a fine handsome creature, who had a pleasant manner and made many friends  The animal he saw most of was a hyena; and one day, when they were taking a walk together, they picked up a beautiful green cloak, which had evidently been dropped by some one riding across the plain on a camel  Of course each wanted to have it, and they almost quarrelled over the matter; but at length it was settled that the hyena should wear the cloak by day and the jackal by night  After a little while, however, the jackal became discontented with this arrangement, declaring that none of his friends, who were quite different from those of the hyena, could see the splendour of the mantle, and that it was only fair that he should sometimes be allowed to wear it by day  To this the hyena would by no means consent, and they were on the eve of a quarrel when the hyena proposed that they should ask the lion to judge between them', " The jackal agreed to this, and the hyena wrapped the cloak about him, and they both trotted off to the lion's den", ' The jackal, who was fond of talking, at once told the story; and when it was finished the lion turned to the hyena and asked if it was true', " 'Quite true, your majesty,' answered the hyena", " 'Then lay the cloak on the ground at my feet,' said the lion, 'and I will give my judgment", "' So the mantle was spread upon the red earth, the hyena and the jackal standing on each side of it", ' There was silence for a few moments, and then the lion sat up, looking very great and wise', " 'My judgment is that the garment shall belong wholly to whoever first rings the bell of the nearest mosque at dawn to-morrow", " Now go; for much business awaits me!' All that night the hyena sat up, fearing lest the jackal should reach the bell before him, for the mosque was close at hand", ' With the first streak of dawn he bounded away to the bell, just as the jackal, who had slept soundly all night, was rising to his feet', " 'Good luck to you,' cried the jackal", ' And throwing the cloak over his back he darted away across the plain, and was seen no more by his friend the hyena  After running several miles the jackal thought he was safe from pursuit, and seeing a lion and another hyena talking together, he strolled up to join them', " 'Good morning,' he said; 'may I ask what is the matter? You seem very serious about something", "' 'Pray sit down,' answered the lion", " 'We were wondering in which direction we should go to find the best dinner", ' The hyena wishes to go to the forest, and I to the mountains', " What do you say?' 'Well, as I was sauntering over the plain, just now, I noticed a flock of sheep grazing, and some of them had wandered into a little valley quite out of sight of the shepherd", ' If you keep among the rocks you will never be observed', " But perhaps you will allow me to go with you and show you the way?' 'You are really very kind,' answered the lion", ' And they crept steadily along till at length they reached the mouth of the valley where a ram, a sheep and a lamb were feeding on the rich grass, unconscious of their danger', " 'How shall we divide them?' asked the lion in a whisper to the hyena", " 'Oh, it is easily done,' replied the hyena", " 'The lamb for me, the sheep for the jackal, and the ram for the lion", "' 'So I am to have that lean creature, which is nothing but horns, am I?' cried the lion in a rage" ,  ' Now that the father and elder brother were both dead, all that was left of the jackal family was one son, who was no less cunning than the others had been  He did not like staying in the same place any better than they, and nobody ever knew in what part of the country he might be found next  One day, when we was wandering about he beheld a nice fat sheep, which was cropping the grass and seemed quite contented with her lot', " 'Good morning,' said the jackal, 'I am so glad to see you", ' I have been looking for you everywhere', "' 'For ME?' answered the sheep, in an astonished voice; 'but we have never met before!' 'No; but I have heard of you", " Oh! You don't know what fine things I have heard! Ah, well, some people have all the luck!' 'You are very kind, I am sure,' answered the sheep, not knowing which way to look", " 'Is there any way in which I can help you?' 'There is something that I had set my heart on, though I hardly like to propose it on so short an acquaintance; but from what people have told me, I thought that you and I might keep house together comfortably, if you would only agree to try", ' I have several fields belonging to me, and if they are kept well watered they bear wonderful crops', "' 'Perhaps I might come for a short time,' said the sheep, with a little hesitation; 'and if we do not get on, we can part company", "' 'Oh, thank you, thank you,' cried the jackal; 'do not let us lose a moment", "' And he held out his paw in such an inviting manner that the sheep got up and trotted beside him till they reached home", " 'Now,' said the jackal, 'you go to the well and fetch the water, and I will pour it into the trenches that run between the patches of corn", "' And as he did so he sang lustily", ' The work was very hard, but the sheep did not grumble, and by-and-by was rewarded at seeing the little green heads poking themselves through earth  After that the hot sun ripened them quickly, and soon harvest time was come  Then the grain was cut and ground and ready for sale', " When everything was complete, the jackal said to the sheep: 'Now let us divide it, so that we can each do what we like with his share", "' 'You do it,' answered the sheep; 'here are the scales", ' You must weigh it carefully', "' So the jackal began to weigh it, and when he had finished, he counted out loud: 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven parts for the jackal, and one part for the sheep", ' If she likes it she can take it, if not, she can leave it', "' The sheep looked at the two heaps in silence- -one so large, the other so small; and then she answered: 'Wait for a minute, while I fetch some sacks to carry away my share", "' But it was not sacks that the sheep wanted; for as soon as the jackal could no longer see her she set forth at her best pace to the home of the greyhound, where she arrived panting with the haste she had made", " 'Oh, good uncle, help me, I pray you!' she cried, as soon as she could speak", " 'Why, what is the matter?' asked the greyhound, looking up with astonishment", " 'I beg you to return with me, and frighten the jackal into paying me what he owes me,' answered the sheep", " 'For months we have lived together, and I have twice every day drawn the water, while he only poured it into the trenches", ' Together we have reaped our harvest; and now, when the moment to divide our crop has come, he has taken seven parts for himself, and only left one for me', "' She finished, and giving herself a twist, passed her woolly tail across her eyes; while the greyhound watched her, but held his peace" ,  ' At the same time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the future Buddha was born one of a peasant family; and when he grew up, he gained his living by tilling the ground  At that time a hawker used to go from place to place, trafficking in goods carried by an ass', " Now at each place he came to, when he took the pack down from the ass's back, he used to clothe him in a lion's skin, and turn him loose in the rice and barley fields", ' And when the watchmen in the fields saw the ass, they dared not go near him, taking him for a lion', " So one day the hawker stopped in a village; and whilst he was getting his own breakfast cooked, he dressed the ass in a lion's skin, and turned him loose in a barley-field", ' The watchmen in the field dared not go up to him; but going home, they published the news  Then all the villagers came out with weapons in their hands; and blowing chanks, and beating drums, they went near the field and shouted  Terrified with the fear of death, the ass uttered a cry--the bray of an ass! And when he knew him then to be an ass, the future Buddha pronounced the First Verse:   "This is not a lion\'s roaring,   Nor a tiger\'s, nor a panther\'s;   Dressed in a lion\'s skin,    \'Tis a wretched ass that roars!" But when the villagers knew the creature to be an ass, they beat him till his bones broke; and, carrying off the lion\'s skin, went away  Then the hawker came; and seeing the ass fallen into so bad a plight, pronounced the Second Verse:   "Long might the ass,   Clad in a lion\'s skin,   Have fed on the barley green    But he brayed!    And that moment he came to ruin " And even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot!    There was to be a great battle between all the creatures of the earth and the birds of the air  News of it went abroad, and the son of the king of Tethertown said that when the battle was fought he would be there to see it, and would bring back word who was to be king  But in spite of that, he was almost too late, and every fight had been fought save the last, which was between a snake and a great black raven', " Both struck hard, but in the end the snake proved the stronger, and would have twisted himself round the neck of the raven till he died had not the king's son drawn his sword, and cut off the head of the snake at a single blow", " And when the raven beheld that his enemy was dead, he was grateful, and said: 'For thy kindness to me this day, I will show thee a sight", ' So come up now on the root of my two wings', "' The king's son did as he was bid, and before the raven stopped flying, they had passed over seven bens and seven glens and seven mountain moors", " 'Do you see that house yonder?' said the raven at last", " 'Go straight for it, for a sister of mine dwells there, and she will make you right welcome", ' And if she asks, "Wert thou at the battle of the birds?" answer that thou wert, and if she asks, "Didst thou see my likeness?" answer that thou sawest it, but be sure thou meetest me in the morning at this place', "' The king's son followed what the raven told him and that night he had meat of each meat, and drink of each drink, warm water for his feet, and a soft bed to lie in", " Thus it happened the next day, and the next, but on the fourth meeting, instead of meeting the raven, in his place the king's son found waiting for him the handsomest youth that ever was seen, with a bundle in his hand", " 'Is there a raven hereabouts?' asked the king's son, and the youth answered: 'I am that raven, and I was delivered by thee from the spells that bound me, and in reward thou wilt get this bundle", ' Go back by the road thou camest, and lie as before, a night in each house, but be careful not to unloose the bundle till thou art in the place wherein thou wouldst most wish to dwell', "' Then the king's son set out, and thus it happened as it had happened before, till he entered a thick wood near his father's house", ' He had walked a long way and suddenly the bundle seemed to grow heavier; first he put it down under a tree, and next he thought he would look at it', " The string was easy to untie, and the king's son soon unfastened the bundle", ' What was it he saw there? Why, a great castle with an orchard all about it, and in the orchard fruit and flowers and birds of very kind', " It was all ready for him to dwell in, but instead of being in the midst of the forest, he did wish he had left the bundle unloosed till he had reached the green valley close to his father's palace", ' Well, it was no use wishing, and with a sigh he glanced up, and beheld a huge giant coming towards him', " 'Bad is the place where thou hast built thy house, king's son,' said the giant", " 'True; it is not here that I wish to be,' answered the king's son", " 'What reward wilt thou give me if I put it back in the bundle?' asked the giant", " 'What reward dost thou ask?' answered the king's son", " 'The first boy thou hast when he is seven years old,' said the giant", " 'If I have a boy thou shalt get him,' answered the king's son, and as he spoke the castle and the orchard were tied up in the bundle again", " 'Now take thy road, and I will take mine,' said the giant", " 'And if thou forgettest thy promise, I will remember it", "' Light of heart the king's son went on his road, till he came to the green valley near his father's palace", ' Slowly he unloosed the bundle, fearing lest he should find nothing but a heap of stones or rags  Proud King Hagag sat on his throne in state, and the high priest, standing by his side, read from the Holy Book, as was his daily custom  He read these words: "For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?" "Cease!" cried the king  "Who wrote those words?" "They are the words of the Holy Book," answered the high priest  "Give me the book," commanded the king  With trembling hands the high priest placed it before his majesty  King Hagag gazed earnestly at the words that had been read, and he frowned  Raising his hand, he tore the page from the book and threw it to the ground  "I, Hagag, am king," he said, "and all such passages that offend me shall be torn out " He flung the volume angrily from him while the high priest and all his courtiers looked on in astonishment  "I have heard enough for today," he said  "Too long have I delayed my hunting expedition  Let the horses be got ready " He descended from the throne, stalked haughtily past the trembling figure of the high priest, and went forth to the hunt  Soon he was riding furiously across an open plain toward a forest where a wild stag had been seen  A trumpet sounded the signal that the deer had been driven from its hiding place, and the king urged his horse forward to be the first in the chase', " His majesty's steed was the swiftest in the land", ' Quickly it carried him out of sight of his nobles and attendants  But the deer was surprisingly fleet and the king could not catch up with it  Coming to a river, the animal plunged in and swam across  Scrambling up the opposite bank its antlers caught in the branch of a tree, and the king, arriving at the river, gave a cry of joy  "Now I have thee," he said  Springing from his horse and divesting himself of his clothing he swam across with naught but a sword  As he reached the opposite bank, however, the deer freed itself from the tree and plunged into a thicket  The king, with his sword in his hand, followed quickly, but no deer could he see  Instead, he found, lying on the ground beyond the thicket, a beautiful youth clad in a deer-skin  He was panting as if after a long run  The king stood still in surprise and the youth sprang to his feet  "I am the deer," he said  "I am a genii and I have lured thee to this spot, proud king, to teach thee a lesson for thy words this morning " Before King Hagag could recover from his surprise the youth ran back to the river and swam across  Once upon a time there dwelt in the land of Erin a young man who was seeking a wife, and of all the maidens round about none pleased him as well as the only daughter of a farmer  The girl was willing and the father was willing, and very soon they were married and went to live at the farm  By and bye the season came when they must cut the peats and pile them up to dry, so that they might have fires in the winter  So on a fine day the girl and her husband, and the father and his wife all went out upon the moor  They worked hard for many hours, and at length grew hungry, so the young woman was sent home to bring them food, and also to give the horses their dinner', " When she went into the stables, she suddenly saw the heavy pack-saddle of the speckled mare just over her head, and she jumped and said to herself: 'Suppose that pack-saddle were to fall and kill me, how dreadful it would be!' and she sat down just under the pack-saddle she was so much afraid of, and began to cry", ' Now the others out on the moor grew hungrier and hungrier', " 'What can have become of her?' asked they, and at length the mother declared that she would wait no longer, and must go and see what had happened", ' As the bride was nowhere in the kitchen or the dairy, the old woman went into the stable, where she found her daughter weeping bitterly', " 'What is the matter, my dove?' and the girl answered, between her sobs: 'When I came in and saw the pack-saddle over my head, I thought how dreadful it would be if it fell and killed me,' and she cried louder than before", " The old woman struck her hands together: 'Ah, to think of it! if that were to be, what should I do?' and she sat down by her daughter, and they both wrung their hands and let their tears flow", " 'Something strange must have occurred,' exclaimed the old farmer on the moor, who by this time was not only hungry, but cross", " 'I must go after them", "' And he went and found them in the stable", " 'What is the matter?' asked he", " 'Oh!' replied his wife, 'when our daughter came home, did she not see the pack-saddle over her head, and she thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall and kill her", "' 'Ah, to think of it!' exclaimed he, striking his hands together, and he sat down beside them and wept too", ' As soon as night fell the young man returned full of hunger, and there they were, all crying together in the stable', " 'What is the matter?' asked he", " 'When thy wife came home,' answered the farmer, 'she saw the pack-saddle over her head, and she thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall and kill her", "' 'Well, but it didn't fall,' replied the young man, and he went off to the kitchen to get some supper, leaving them to cry as long as they liked", " The next morning he got up with the sun, and said to the old man and to the old woman and to his wife: 'Farewell: my foot shall not return to the house till I have found other three people as silly as you,' and he walked away till he came to the town, and seeing the door of a cottage standing open wide, he entered", ' No man was present, but only some women spinning at their wheels', " 'You do not belong to this town,' said he", " 'You speak truth,' they answered, 'nor you either?' 'I do not,' replied he, 'but is it a good place to live in?' The women looked at each other", " 'The men of the town are so silly that we can make them believe anything we please,' said they", " 'Well, here is a gold ring,' replied he, 'and I will give it to the one amongst you who can make her husband believe the most impossible thing,' and he left them", " As soon as the first husband came home his wife said to him: 'Thou art sick!' 'Am I?' asked he", " 'Yes, thou art,' she answered; 'take off thy clothes and lie down", "' So he did, and when he was in his bed his wife went to him and said: 'Thou art dead" ,  ' People said "The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting " For a strange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town  It was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a moment, for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude made too great a noise  Those persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were farther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see the evening sky still better, and heard the sound of the bell much more distinctly  It was as if the tones came from a church in the still forest; people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most solemnly  A long time passed, and people said to each other--"I wonder if there is a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet; let us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer " And the rich people drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely long to them; and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the skirts of the forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long branches, and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood  The confectioner of the town came out, and set up his booth there; and soon after came another confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as a sign or ornament, but it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to preserve it from the rain  When all the people returned home, they said it had been very romantic, and that it was quite a different sort of thing to a pic-nic or tea-party  There were three persons who asserted they had penetrated to the end of the forest, and that they had always heard the wonderful sounds of the bell, but it had seemed to them as if it had come from the town  One wrote a whole poem about it, and said the bell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child, and that no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell  The king of the country was also observant of it, and vowed that he who could discover whence the sounds proceeded, should have the title of "Universal Bell-ringer," even if it were not really a bell  Many persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place, but one only returned with a sort of explanation; for nobody went far enough, that one not further than the others  However, he said that the sound proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of learned owl, that continually knocked its head against the branches  But whether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no one could say with certainty  So now he got the place of "Universal Bell-ringer," and wrote yearly a short treatise "On the Owl"; but everybody was just as wise as before  It was the day of confirmation  The clergyman had spoken so touchingly, the children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was an eventful day for them; from children they become all at once grown-up-persons; it was as if their infant souls were now to fly all at once into persons with more understanding  The sun was shining gloriously; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town; and from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell with wonderful distinctness  They all immediately felt a wish to go thither; all except three', " One of them had to go home to try on a ball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her to be confirmed this time, for otherwise she would not have come; the other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and boots to be confirmed in from the innkeeper's son, and he was to give them back by a certain hour; the third said that he never went to a strange place if his parents were not with him--that he had always been a good boy hitherto, and would still be so now that he was confirmed, and that one ought not to laugh at him for it: the others, however, did make fun of him, after all", ' There were three, therefore, that did not go; the others hastened on  The sun shone, the birds sang, and the children sang too, and each held the other by the hand; for as yet they had none of them any high office, and were all of equal rank in the eye of God  But two of the youngest soon grew tired, and both returned to town; two little girls sat down, and twined garlands, so they did not go either; and when the others reached the willow-tree, where the confectioner was, they said, "Now we are there! In reality the bell does not exist; it is only a fancy that people have taken into their heads!" At the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood, so clear and solemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further  It was so thick, and the foliage so dense, that it was quite fatiguing to proceed  Woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high; blooming convolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to tree, where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was very beautiful, but it was no place for girls to go; their clothes would get so torn  Large blocks of stone lay there, overgrown with moss of every color; the fresh spring bubbled forth, and made a strange gurgling sound  "That surely cannot be the bell," said one of the children, lying down and listening  "This must be looked to " So he remained, and let the others go on without him  It happened once that a king, who had a great kingdom and three sons, became blind, and no human skill or art could restore to him his sight', " At last there came to the palace an old woman, who told him that in the whole world there was only one thing that could give him back his sight, and that was to get the bird Grip; his song would open the King's eyes", " When the king's eldest son heard this he offered to bring the bird Grip, which was kept in a cage by a king in another country, and carefully guarded as his greatest treasure", " The blind king was greatly rejoiced at his son's resolve, fitted him out in the best way he could, and let him go", ' When the prince had ridden some distance he came to an inn, in which there were many guests, all of whom were merry, and drank and sang and played at dice  This joyous life pleased the prince so well that he stayed in the inn, took part in the playing and drinking, and forgot both his blind father and the bird Grip', " Meanwhile the king waited with both hope and anxiety for his son's return, but as time went on and nothing was heard of him, the second prince asked leave to go in search of his brother, as well as to bring the bird Grip", ' The king granted his request, and fitted him out in the finest fashion  But when the prince came to the inn and found his brother among his merry companions, he also remained there and forgot both the bird Grip and his blind father  When the king noticed that neither of his sons returned, although a long time had passed since the second one set out, he was greatly distressed, for not only had he lost all hope of getting back his sight, but he had also lost his two eldest sons  The youngest now came to him, and offered to go in search of his brothers and to bring the bird Grip; he was quite certain that he would succeed in this  The king was unwilling to risk his third son on such an errand, but he begged so long that his father had at last to consent  This prince also was fitted out in the finest manner, like his brothers, and so rode away  He also turned into the same inn as his brothers, and when these saw him they assailed him with many entreaties to remain with them and share their merry life  But he answered that now, when he had found them, his next task was to get the bird Grip, for which his blind father was longing, and so he had not a single hour to spare with them in the inn  He then said farewell to his brothers, and rode on to find another inn in which to pass the night  When he had ridden a long way, and it began to grow dark, he came to a house which lay deep in the forest  Here he was received in a very friendly manner by the host, who put his horse into the stable, and led the prince himself into the guest-chamber, where he ordered a maid-servant to lay the cloth and set down the supper  It was now dark, and while the girl was laying the cloth and setting down the dishes, and the prince had begun to appease his hunger, he heard the most piteous shrieks and cries from the next room  He sprang up from the table and asked the girl what those cries were, and whether he had fallen into a den of robbers  The girl answered that these shrieks were heard every night, but it was no living being who uttered them; it was a dead man, who life the host had taken because he could not pay for the meals he had had in the inn  The host further refused to bury the dead man, as he had left nothing to pay the expenses of the funeral, and every night he went and scourged the dead body of his victim  When she had said this she lifted the cover off one of the dishes, and the prince saw that there lay on it a knife and an axe  He understood then that the host meant to ask him by this what kind of death he preferred to die, unless he was willing to ransom his life with his money', " He then summoned the host, gave him a large sum for his own life, and paid the dead man's debt as well, besides paying him for burying the body, which the murderer now promised to attend to", " The prince, however, felt that his life was not safe in this murderer's den, and asked the maid to help him to escape that night", " She replied that the attempt to do so might cost her her own life, as the key of the stable in which the prince's horse stood lay under the host's pillow; but, as she herself was a prisoner there, she would help him to escape if he would take her along with him", ' He promised to do so, and they succeeded in getting away from the inn, and rode on until they came to another far away from it, where the prince got a good place for the girl before proceeding on his journey  As he now rode all alone through a forest there met him a fox, who greeted him in a friendly fashion, and asked him where he was going, and on what errand he was bent  The prince answered that his errand was too important to be confided to everyone that he met  Once upon a time there lived a poor fisher who built a hut on the banks of a stream which, shunning the glare of the sun and the noise of the towns, flowed quietly past trees and under bushes, listening to the songs of the birds overhead  One day, when the fisherman had gone out as usual to cast his nets, he saw borne towards him on the current a cradle of crystal  Slipping his net quickly beneath it he drew it out and lifted the silk coverlet  Inside, lying on a soft bed of cotton, were two babies, a boy and a girl, who opened their eyes and smiled at him  The man was filled with pity at the sight, and throwing down his lines he took the cradle and the babies home to his wife  The good woman flung up her hands in despair when she beheld the contents of the cradle', " 'Are not eight children enough,' she cried, 'without bringing us two more? How do you think we can feed them?' 'You would not have had me leave them to die of hunger,' answered he, 'or be swallowed up by the waves of the sea? What is enough for eight is also enough for ten", "' The wife said no more; and in truth her heart yearned over the little creatures", ' Somehow or other food was never lacking in the hut, and the children grew up and were so good and gentle that, in time, their foster-parents loved them as well or better than their own, who were quarrelsome and envious  It did not take the orphans long to notice that the boys did not like them, and were always playing tricks on them, so they used to go away by themselves and spend whole hours by the banks of the river  Here they would take out the bits of bread they had saved from their breakfasts and crumble them for the birds  In return, the birds taught them many things: how to get up early in the morning, how to sing, and how to talk their language, which very few people know  But though the little orphans did their best to avoid quarrelling with their foster- brothers, it was very difficult always to keep the peace', " Matters got worse and worse till, one morning, the eldest boy said to the twins: 'It is all very well for you to pretend that you have such good manners, and are so much better than we, but we have at least a father and mother, while you have only got the river, like the toads and the frogs", "' The poor children did not answer the insult; but it made them very unhappy", ' And they told each other in whispers that they could not stay there any longer, but must go into the world and seek their fortunes  So next day they arose as early as the birds and stole downstairs without anybody hearing them  One window was open, and they crept softly out and ran to the side of the river  Then, feeling as if they had found a friend, they walked along its banks, hoping that by- and-by they should meet some one to take care of them  The whole of that day they went steadily on without seeing a living creature, till, in the evening, weary and footsore, they saw before them a small hut  This raised their spirits for a moment; but the door was shut, and the hut seemed empty, and so great was their disappointment that they almost cried', " However, the boy fought down his tears, and said cheerfully: 'Well, at any rate here is a bench where we can sit down, and when we are rested we will think what is best to do next", "' Then they sat down, and for some time they were too tired even to notice anything; but by-and-by they saw that under the tiles of the roof a number of swallows were sitting, chattering merrily to each other", ' Of course the swallows had no idea that the children understood their language, or they would not have talked so freely; but, as it was, they said whatever came into their heads', " 'Good evening, my fine city madam,' remarked a swallow, whose manners were rather rough and countryfied to another who looked particularly distinguished", " 'Happy, indeed, are the eyes that behold you! Only think of your having returned to your long-forgotten country friends, after you have lived for years in a palace!' 'I have inherited this nest from my parents,' replied the other, 'and as they left it to me I certainly shall make it my home", " But,' she added politely, 'I hope that you and all your family are well?' 'Very well indeed, I am glad to say", ' But my poor daughter had, a short time ago, such bad inflammation in her eyes that she would have gone blind had I not been able to find the magic herb, which cured her at once', "' 'And how is the nightingale singing? Does the lark soar as high as ever? And does the linnet dress herself as smartly?' But here the country swallow drew herself up", " 'I never talk gossip,' she said severely" ,  ' IN times of yore there was a King and a Queen in the south of Ireland who had three sons, all beautiful children; but the Queen, their mother, sickened unto death when they were yet very young, which caused great grief throughout the Court, particularly to the King, her husband, who could in no wise be comforted', " Seeing that death was drawing near her, she called the King to her and spoke as follows: 'I am now going to leave you, and as you are young and in your prime, of course after my death you will marry again", ' Now all the request I ask of you is that you will build a tower in an island in the sea, wherein you will keep your three sons until they are come of age and fit to do for themselves; so that they may not be under the power or jurisdiction of any other woman', " Neglect not to give them education suitable to their birth, and let them be trained up to every exercise and pastime requisite for king's sons to learn", ' This is all I have to say, so farewell', "' The King had scarce time, with tears in his eyes, to assure her she should be obeyed in everything, when she, turning herself in her bed, with a smile gave up the ghost", ' Never was greater mourning seen than was throughout the Court and the whole kingdom; for a better woman than the Queen, to rich and poor, was not to be found in the world  She was interred with great pomp and magnificence, and the King, her husband, became in a manner inconsolable for the loss of her  However, he caused the tower to be built and his sons placed in it, under proper guardians, according to his promise', " In process of time the lords and knights of the kingdom counselled the King (as he was young) to live no longer as he had done, but to take a wife; which counsel prevailing, they chose him a rich and beautiful princess to be his consort--a neighbouring King's daughter, of whom he was very fond", ' Not long after, the Queen had a fine son, which caused great feasting and rejoicing at the Court, insomuch that the late Queen, in a manner, was entirely forgotten  That fared well, and King and Queen lived happy together for several years  At length the Queen, having some business with the hen-wife, went herself to her, and, after a long conference passed, was taking leave of her, when the hen-wife prayed that if ever she should come back to her again she might break her neck  The Queen, greatly incensed at such a daring insult from one of her meanest subjects, demanded immediately the reason, or she would have her put to death', " 'It was worth your while, madam,' says the hen-wife, 'to pay me well for it, for the reason I prayed so on you concerns you much", "' 'What must I pay you?' asked the Queen", " 'You must give me,' says she, 'the full of a pack of wool, and I have an ancient crock which you must fill with butter, likewise a barrel which you must fill for me full of wheat", "' 'How much wool will it take to the pack?' says the Queen", " 'It will take seven herds of sheep,' said she, 'and their increase for seven years", "' 'How much butter will it take to fill your crock?' 'Seven dairies,' said she, 'and their increase for seven years", "' 'And how much will it take to fill the barrel you have?' says the Queen", " 'It will take the increase of seven barrels of wheat for seven years", "' 'That is a great quantity,' says the Queen; 'but the reason must be extraordinary, and before I want it, I will give you all you demand", "' 'Well,' says the hen-wife, 'it is because you are so stupid that you don't observe or find out those affairs that are so dangerous and hurtful to yourself and your child", "' 'What is that?' says the Queen", " 'Why,' says she, 'the King your husband has three fine sons he had by the late Queen, whom he keeps shut up in a tower until they come of age, intending to divide the kingdom between them, and let your son push his fortune; now, if you don't find some means of destroying them; your child and perhaps yourself will be left desolate in the end", "' 'And what would you advise me to do?' said she; 'I am wholly at a loss in what manner to act in this affair", "' 'You must make known to the King,' says the hen-wife, 'that you heard of his sons, and wonder greatly that he concealed them all this time from you; tell him you wish to see them, and that it is full time for them to be liberated, and that you would be desirous he would bring them to the Court", " The King will then do so, and there will be a great feast prepared on that account, and also diversions of every sort to amuse the people; and in these sports,' said she, 'ask the King's sons to play a game at cards with you, which they will not refuse", " Now,' says the hen-wife, 'you must make a bargain, that if you win they must do whatever you command them, and if they win, that you must do whatever they command you to do; this bargain must be made before the assembly, and here is a pack of cards,' says she, 'that I am thinking you will not lose by" ,  ' There were once a Scotsman and an Englishman and an Irishman serving in the army together, who took it into their heads to run away on the first opportunity they could get  The chance came and they took it  They went on travelling for two days through a great forest, without food or drink, and without coming across a single house, and every night they had to climb up into the trees through fear of the wild beasts that were in the wood  On the second morning the Scotsman saw from the top of his tree a great castle far away  He said to himself that he would certainly die if he stayed in the forest without anything to eat but the roots of grass, which would not keep him alive very long  As soon, then, as he got down out of the tree he set off towards the castle, without so much as telling his companions that he had seen it at all; perhaps the hunger and want they had suffered had changed their nature so much that the one did not care what became of the other if he could save himself  He travelled on most of the day, so that it was quite late when he reached the castle, and to his great disappointment found nothing but closed doors and no smoke rising from the chimneys  He thought there was nothing for it but to die after all, and had lain down beside the wall, when he heard a window being opened high above him  At this he looked up, and saw the most beautiful woman he had ever set eyes on', " 'Oh, it is Fortune that has sent you to me,' he said", " 'It is indeed,' said she", " 'What are you in need of, or what has sent you here?' 'Necessity,' said he", " 'I am dying for want of food and drink", "' 'Come inside, then,' she said; 'there is plenty of both here", "' Accordingly he went in to where she was, and she opened a large room for him, where he saw a number of men lying asleep", ' She then set food before him, and after that showed him to the room where the others were  He lay down on one of the beds and fell sound asleep  And now we must go back to the two that he left behind him in the wood  When nightfall and the time of the wild beasts came upon these, the Englishman happened to climb up into the very same tree on which the Scotsman was when he got a sight of the castle; and as soon as the day began to dawn and the Englishman looked to the four quarters of heaven, what did he see but the castle too! Off he went without saying a word to the Irishman, and everything happened to him just as it had done to the Scotsman  The poor Irishman was now left all alone, and did not know where the others had gone to, so he just stayed where he was, very sad and miserable  When night came he climbed up into the same tree as the Englishman had been on the night before  As soon as day came he also saw the castle, and set out towards it; but when he reached it he could see no signs of fire or living being about it  Before long, however, he heard the window opened above his head, looked up, and beheld the most beautiful woman he had ever seen  He asked if she would give him food and drink, and she answered kindly and heartily that she would, if he would only come inside  This he did very willingly, and she set before him food and drink that he had never seen the like of before  In the room there was a bed, with diamond rings hanging at every loop of the curtains, and everything that was in the room besides astonished him so much that he actually forgot that he was hungry  When she saw that he was not eating at all, she asked him what he wanted yet, to which he replied that he would neither eat nor drink until he knew who she was, or where she came from, or who had put her there', " 'I shall tell you that,' said she", " 'I am an enchanted Princess, and my father has promised that the man who releases me from the spell shall have the third of his kingdom while he is alive, and the whole of it after he is dead, and marry me as well", ' If ever I saw a man who looked likely to do this, you are the one  In a beautiful island that lies in the southern seas, where chains of gay orchids bind the trees together, and the days and nights are equally long and nearly equally hot, there once lived a family of seven sisters  Their father and mother were dead, and they had no brothers, so the eldest girl ruled over the rest, and they all did as she bade them  One sister had to clean the house, a second carried water from the spring in the forest, a third cooked their food, while to the youngest fell the hardest task of all, for she had to cut and bring home the wood which was to keep the fire continually burning  This was very hot and tiring work, and when she had fed the fire and heaped up in a corner the sticks that were to supply it till the next day, she often threw herself down under a tree, and went sound asleep  One morning, however, as she was staggering along with her bundle on her back, she thought that the river which flowed past their hut looked so cool and inviting that she determined to bathe in it, instead of taking her usual nap  Hastily piling up her load by the fire, and thrusting some sticks into the flame, she ran down to the river and jumped in  How delicious it was diving and swimming and floating in the dark forest, where the trees were so thick that you could hardly see the sun! But after a while she began to look about her, and her eyes fell on a little fish that seemed made out of a rainbow, so brilliant were the colours he flashed out', " 'I should like him for a pet,' thought the girl, and the next time the fish swam by, she put out her hand and caught him", ' Then she ran along the grassy path till she came to a cave in front of which a stream fell over some rocks into a basin  Here she put her little fish, whose name was Djulung-djulung, and promising to return soon and bring him some dinner, she went away  By the time she got home, the rice for their dinner was ready cooked, and the eldest sister gave the other six their portions in wooden bowls  But the youngest did not finish hers, and when no one was looking, stole off to the fountain in the forest where the little fish was swimming about', " 'See! I have not forgotten you,' she cried, and one by one she let the grains of rice fall into the water, where the fish gobbled them up greedily, for he had never tasted anything so nice", " 'That is all for to-day,' she said at last, 'but I will come again to-morrow,' and biding him good-bye she went down the path", ' Now the girl did not tell her sisters about the fish, but every day she saved half of her rice to give him, and called him softly in a little song she had made for herself  If she sometimes felt hungry, no one knew of it, and, indeed, she did not mind that much, when she saw how the fish enjoyed it  And the fish grew fat and big, but the girl grew thin and weak, and the loads of wood felt heavier every day, and at last her sisters noticed it  Then they took counsel together, and watched her to see what she did, and one of them followed her to the fountain where Djulung lived, and saw her give him all the rice she had saved from her breakfast  Hastening home the sister told the others what she had witnessed, and that a lovely fat fish might be had for the catching  So the eldest sister went and caught him, and he was boiled for supper, but the youngest sister was away in the woods, and did not know anything about it  Next morning she went as usual to the cave, and sang her little song, but no Djulung came to answer it; twice and thrice she sang, then threw herself on her knees by the edge, and peered into the dark water, but the trees cast such a deep shadow that her eyes could not pierce it', " 'Djulung cannot be dead, or his body would be floating on the surface,' she said to herself, and rising to her feet she set out homewards, feeling all of a sudden strangely tired", " 'What is the matter with me?' she thought, but somehow or other she managed to reach the hut, and threw herself down in a corner, where she slept so soundly that for days no one was able to wake her", ' At length, one morning early, a cock began to crow so loud that she could sleep no longer and as he continued to crow she seemed to understand what he was saying, and that he was telling her that Djulung was dead, killed and eaten by her sisters, and that his bones lay buried under the kitchen fire  Very softly she got up, and took up the large stone under the fire, and creeping out carried the bones to the cave by the fountain, where she dug a hole and buried them anew  And as she scooped out the hole with a stick she sang a song, bidding the bones grow till they became a tree--a tree that reached up so high into the heavens that its leaves would fall across the sea into another island, whose king would pick them up  As there was no Djulung to give her rice to, the girl soon became fat again, and as she was able to do her work as of old, her sisters did not trouble about her  They never guessed that when she went into the forest to gather her sticks, she never failed to pay a visit to the tree, which grew taller and more wonderful day by day  Never was such a tree seen before', " Its trunk was of iron, its leaves were of silk, its flowers of gold, and its fruit of diamonds, and one evening, though the girl did not know it, a soft breeze took one of the leaves, and blew it across the sea to the feet of one of the king's attendants" ,  ' No one intended to leave Martha alone that afternoon, but it happened that everyone was called away, for one reason or another  Mrs', " McFarland was attending the weekly card party held by the Women's Anti-Gambling League", " Sister Nell's young man had called quite unexpectedly to take her for a long drive", ' Papa was at the office, as usual', " It was Mary Ann's day out", ' As for Emeline, she certainly should have stayed in the house and looked after the little girl; but Emeline had a restless nature  "Would you mind, miss, if I just crossed the alley to speak a word to Mrs  Carleton\'s girl?" she asked Martha  "\'Course not," replied the child  "You\'d better lock the back door, though, and take the key, for I shall be upstairs " "Oh, I\'ll do that, of course, miss," said the delighted maid, and ran away to spend the afternoon with her friend, leaving Martha quite alone in the big house, and locked in, into the bargain  The little girl read a few pages in her new book, sewed a few stitches in her embroidery and started to "play visiting" with her four favorite dolls', " Then she remembered that in the attic was a doll's playhouse that hadn't been used for months, so she decided she would dust it and put it in order", ' Filled with this idea, the girl climbed the winding stairs to the big room under the roof  It was well lighted by three dormer windows and was warm and pleasant  Around the walls were rows of boxes and trunks, piles of old carpeting, pieces of damaged furniture, bundles of discarded clothing and other odds and ends of more or less value  Every well-regulated house has an attic of this sort, so I need not describe it', " The doll's house had been moved, but after a search Martha found it away over in a corner near the big chimney", ' She drew it out and noticed that behind it was a black wooden chest which Uncle Walter had sent over from Italy years and years ago--before Martha was born, in fact  Mamma had told her about it one day; how there was no key to it, because Uncle Walter wished it to remain unopened until he returned home; and how this wandering uncle, who was a mighty hunter, had gone into Africa to hunt elephants and had never been heard from afterwards  The little girl looked at the chest curiously, now that it had by accident attracted her attention', " It was quite big--bigger even than mamma's traveling trunk--and was studded all over with tarnished brassheaded nails", ' It was heavy, too, for when Martha tried to lift one end of it she found she could not stir it a bit  But there was a place in the side of the cover for a key  She stooped to examine the lock, and saw that it would take a rather big key to open it', " Then, as you may suspect, the little girl longed to open Uncle Walter's big box and see what was in it", ' For we are all curious, and little girls are just as curious as the rest of us  "I don\'t b\'lieve Uncle Walter\'ll ever come back," she thought  "Papa said once that some elephant must have killed him  Once upon a time an Indian hunter built himself a house in the middle of a great forest, far away from all his tribe; for his heart was gentle and kind, and he was weary of the treachery and cruel deeds of those who had been his friends  So he left them, and took his wife and three children, and they journeyed on until they found a spot near to a clear stream, where they began to cut down trees, and to make ready their wigwam  For many years they lived peacefully and happily in this sheltered place, never leaving it except to hunt the wild animals, which served them both for food and clothes  At last, however, the strong man felt sick, and before long he knew he must die  So he gathered his family round him, and said his last words to them', " 'You, my wife, the companion of my days, will follow me ere many moons have waned to the island of the blest", ' But for you, O my children, whose lives are but newly begun, the wickedness, unkindness, and ingratitude from which I fled are before you  Yet I shall go hence in peace, my children, if you will promise always to love each other, and never to forsake your youngest brother', " 'Never!' they replied, holding out their hands", ' And the hunter died content  Scarcely eight moons had passed when, just as he had said, the wife went forth, and followed her husband; but before leaving her children she bade the two elder ones think of their promise never to forsake the younger, for he was a child, and weak', " And while the snow lay thick upon the ground, they tended him and cherished him; but when the earth showed green again, the heart of the young man stirred within him, and he longed to see the wigwams of the village where his father's youth was spent", " Therefore he opened all his heart to his sister, who answered: 'My brother, I understand your longing for our fellow-men, whom here we cannot see", " But remember our father's words", " Shall we not seek our own pleasures, and forget the little one?' But he would not listen, and, making no reply, he took his bow and arrows and left the hut", " The snows fell and melted, yet he never returned; and at last the heart of the girl grew cold and hard, and her little boy became a burden in her eyes, till one day she spoke thus to him: 'See, there is food for many days to come", ' Stay here within the shelter of the hut  I go to seek our brother, and when I have found him I shall return hither', "' But when, after hard journeying, she reached the village where her brother dwelt, and saw that he had a wife and was happy, and when she, too, was sought by a young brave, then she also forgot the boy alone in the forest, and thought only of her husband", ' Now as soon as the little boy had eaten all the food which his sister had left him, he went out into the woods, and gathered berries and dug up roots, and while the sun shone he was contented and had his fill  But when the snows began and the wind howled, then his stomach felt empty and his limbs cold, and he hid in trees all the night, and only crept out to eat what the wolves had left behind  And by-and-by, having no other friends, he sought their company, and sat by while they devoured their prey, and they grew to know him, and gave him food  And without them he would have died in the snow  But at last the snows melted, and the ice upon the great lake, and as the wolves went down to the shore, the boy went after them', " And it happened one day that his big brother was fishing in his canoe near the shore, and he heard the voice of a child singing in the Indian tone--   'My brother, my brother!    I am becoming a wolf,    I am becoming a wolf!' And when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl", " Then the heart of the elder sunk, and he hastened towards him, crying, 'Brother, little brother, come to me;' but he, being half a wolf, only continued his song", " And the louder the elder called him, 'Brother, little brother, come to me,' the swifter he fled after his brothers the wolves, and the heavier grew his skin, till, with a long howl, he vanished into the depths of the forest", ' So, with shame and anguish in his soul, the elder brother went back to his village, and, with his sister, mourned the little boy and the broken promise till the end of his life     Dectera, one of the sisters of Conchubar Mac Nessa, married a prince whose patrimony lay along the shores of the Muirnict, and whose capital was Dun Dalgan  They had one child, a boy, whom they named Setanta  As soon as Setanta was able to understand the stories and conversation of those around him, he evinced a passion for arms and the martial life, which was so premature and violent as to surprise all who knew him  His thoughts for ever ran on the wars and achievements of the Red Branch  He knew all the knights by name, the appearance and bearing of each, and what deeds of valour they had severally performed  Emain Macha, the capital of the Clanna Rury, was never out of his mind  He saw for ever before his mind its moats and ramparts, its gates and bridges, its streets filled with martial men, its high-raised Duns and Raths, its branching roads, over which came the tributes of wide Ulla to the High King', " He had seen his father's tribute driven thither, and had even longed to be one of the four-footed beasts that he beheld wending their way to the wondrous city", ' But, above all, he delighted to be told of the great school where the young nobles of Ulster were taught martial exercises and the military art, under the superintendence of chosen knights and of the High King himself  Of the several knights he had his own opinion, and had already resolved to accept no one as his instructor save Fergus Mac Roy, tanist of Ulster  Of his father he saw little  His mind had become impaired, and he was confined in a secluded part of the Dun  But whenever he spoke to Dectera of what was nearest his heart, and his desire to enter the military school at Emain Macha, she laughed, and said that he was not yet old enough to endure that rough life  But secretly she was alarmed, and formed plans to detain him at home altogether  Then Setanta concealed his desire, but enquired narrowly concerning the partings of the roads on the way to Emania', " At last, when he was ten years old, selecting a favourable night, Setanta stole away from his father's Dun, and before morning had crossed the frontier", ' He then lay down to rest and sleep in a wood', " After this he set out again, travelling quickly, lest he should be met by any of his father's people", ' On his back was strapped his little wooden shield, and by his side hung a sword of lath  He had brought his ball and hurle of red-bronze with him, and ran swiftly along the road, driving the ball before him, or throwing up his javelin into the air, and running to meet it ere it fell', " In the afternoon of that day Fergus Mac Roy and the King sat together in the part that surrounded the King's palace", ' A chessboard was between them, and their attention was fixed on the game  At a distance the young nobles were at their sports, and the shouts of the boys and the clash of the metal hurles resounded in the evening air  Suddenly, the noise ceased, and Fergus and the King looked up  They saw a strange boy rushing backwards and forwards through the crowd of young nobles, urging the ball in any direction that he pleased, as if in mockery, till none but the very best players attempted to stop him, while the rest stood about the ground in groups  Fergus and the King looked at each other for a moment in silence  After this the boys came together into a group and held a council  Then commenced what seemed to be an attempt to force him out of the ground, followed by a furious fight  The strange boy seemed to be a very demon of war; with his little hurle grasped, like a war-mace, in both hands, he laid about him on every side, and the boys were tumbling fast', " He sprang at tall youths, like a hound at a stag's throat" ,  ' Once upon a time what happened did happen: and if it had not happened, you would never have heard this story  Well, once upon a time there lived an emperor who had half a world all to himself to rule over, and in this world dwelt an old herd and his wife and their three daughters, Anna, Stana, and Laptitza  Anna, the eldest, was so beautiful that when she took the sheep to pasture they forgot to eat as long as she was walking with them  Stana, the second, was so beautiful that when she was driving the flock the wolves protected the sheep', " But Laptitza, the youngest, with a skin as white as the foam on the milk, and with hair as soft as the finest lamb's wool, was as beautiful as both her sisters put together--as beautiful as she alone could be", ' One summer day, when the rays of the sun were pouring down on the earth, the three sisters went to the wood on the outskirts of the mountain to pick strawberries  As they were looking about to find where the largest berries grew they heard the tramp of horses approaching, so loud that you would have thought a whole army was riding by  But it was only the emperor going to hunt with his friends and attendants  They were all fine handsome young men, who sat their horses as if they were part of them, but the finest and handsomest of all was the young emperor himself  As they drew near the three sisters, and marked their beauty, they checked their horses and rode slowly by', " 'Listen, sisters!' said Anna, as they passed on", " 'If one of those young men should make me his wife, I would bake him a loaf of bread which should keep him young and brave for ever", "' 'And if I,' said Stana, 'should be the one chosen, I would weave my husband a shirt which will keep him unscathed when he fights with dragons; when he goes through water he will never even be wet; or if through fire, it will not scorch him", "' 'And I,' said Laptitza, 'will give the man who chooses me two boys, twins, each with a golden star on his forehead, as bright as those in the sky", "' And though they spoke low the young men heard, and turned their horses' heads", " 'I take you at your word, and mine shall you be, most lovely of empresses!' cried the emperor, and swung Laptitza and her strawberries on the horse before him", " 'And I will have you,' 'And I you,' exclaimed two of his friends, and they all rode back to the palace together", ' The following morning the marriage ceremony took place, and for three days and three nights there was nothing but feasting over the whole kingdom', " And when the rejoicings were over the news was in everybody's mouth that Anna had sent for corn, and had made the loaf of which she had spoken at the strawberry beds", ' And then more days and nights passed, and this rumour was succeeded by another one--that Stana had procured some flax, and had dried it, and combed it, and spun it into linen, and sewed it herself into the shirt of which she had spoken over the strawberry beds  Now the emperor had a stepmother, and she had a daughter by her first husband, who lived with her in the palace', " The girl's mother had always believed that her daughter would be empress, and not the 'Milkwhite Maiden,' the child of a mere shepherd", ' So she hated the girl with all her heart, and only bided her time to do her ill  But she could do nothing as long as the emperor remained with his wife night and day, and she began to wonder what she could do to get him away from her  At last, when everything else had failed, she managed to make her brother, who was king of the neighbouring country, declare war against the emperor, and besiege some of the frontier towns with a large army  This time her scheme was successful  The young emperor sprang up in wrath the moment he heard the news, and vowed that nothing, not even his wife, should hinder his giving them battle  And hastily assembling whatever soldiers happened to be at hand he set off at once to meet the enemy  The other king had not reckoned on the swiftness of his movements, and was not ready to receive him  The emperor fell on him when he was off his guard, and routed his army completely  Once upon a time there lived a poor widow who had one little boy  At first sight you would not have thought that he was different from a thousand other little boys; but then you noticed that by his side hung the scabbard of a sword, and as the boy grew bigger the scabbard grew bigger too  The sword which belonged to the scabbard was found by the little boy sticking out of the ground in the garden, and every day he pulled it up to see if it would go into the scabbard  But though it was plainly becoming longer and longer, it was some time before the two would fit  However, there came a day at last when it slipped in quite easily  The child was so delighted that he could hardly believe his eyes, so he tried it seven times, and each time it slipped in more easily than before  But pleased though the boy was, he determined not to tell anyone about it, particularly not his mother, who never could keep anything from her neighbours  Still, in spite of his resolutions, he could not hide altogether that something had happened, and when he went in to breakfast his mother asked him what was the matter', " 'Oh, mother, I had such a nice dream last night,' said he; 'but I can't tell it to anybody", "' 'You can tell it to me,' she answered", " 'It must have been a nice dream, or you wouldn't look so happy", "' 'No, mother; I can't tell it to anybody,' returned the boy, 'till it comes true", "' 'I want to know what it was, and know it I will,' cried she, 'and I will beat you till you tell me", "' But it was no use, neither words nor blows would get the secret out of the boy; and when her arm was quite tired and she had to leave off, the child, sore and aching, ran into the garden and knelt weeping beside his little sword", ' It was working round and round in its hole all by itself, and if anyone except the boy had tried to catch hold of it, he would have been badly cut  But the moment he stretched out his hand it stopped and slid quietly into the scabbard  For a long time the child sat sobbing, and the noise was heard by the king as he was driving by', " 'Go and see who it is that is crying so,' said he to one of his servants, and the man went", " In a few minutes he returned saying: 'Your Majesty, it is a little boy who is kneeling there sobbing because his mother has beaten him", "' 'Bring him to me at once,' commanded the monarch, 'and tell him that it is the king who sends for him, and that he has never cried in all his life and cannot bear anyone else to do so", "' On receiving this message the boy dried his tears and went with the servant to the royal carriage", " 'Will you be my son?' asked the king", " 'Yes, if my mother will let me,' answered the boy", ' And the king bade the servant go back to the mother and say that if she would give her boy to him, he should live in the palace and marry his prettiest daughter as soon as he was a man', " The widow's anger now turned into joy, and she came running to the splendid coach and kissed the king's hand", " 'I hope you will be more obedient to his Majesty than you were to me,' she said; and the boy shrank away half-frightened", ' But when she had gone back to her cottage, he asked the king if he might fetch something that he had left in the garden, and when he was given permission, he pulled up his little sword, which he slid into the scabbard  Then he climbed into the coach and was driven away', " After they had gone some distance the king said: 'Why were you crying so bitterly in the garden just now?' 'Because my mother had been beating me,' replied the boy", " 'And what did she do that for?' asked the king again" ,  ' In a country were seven daughters of poor parents, who used to come daily to play under the shady trees in the King\'s garden with the gardener\'s daughter; and daily she used to say to them, "When I am married I shall have a son  Such a beautiful boy as he will be has never been seen  He will have a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin " Then her playfellows used to laugh at her and mock her  But one day the King heard her telling them about the beautiful boy she would have when she was married, and he said to himself he should like very much to have such a son; the more so that though he had already four Queens he had no child  He went, therefore, to the gardener and told him he wished to marry his daughter  This delighted the gardener and his wife, who thought it would indeed be grand for their daughter to become a princess  So they said "Yes" to the King, and invited all their friends to the wedding  The King invited all his, and he gave the gardener as much money as he wanted  Then the wedding was held with great feasting and rejoicing', " A year later the day drew near on which the gardener's daughter was to have her son; and the King's four other Queens came constantly to see her", ' One day they said to her, "The King hunts every day; and the time is soon coming when you will have your child  Suppose you fell ill whilst he was out hunting and could therefore know nothing of your illness, what would you do then?" When the King came home that evening, the gardener\'s daughter said to him, "Every day you go out hunting  Should I ever be in trouble or sick while you are away, how could I send for you?" The King gave her a kettle-drum which he placed near the door for her, and he said to her, "Whenever you want me, beat this kettle-drum  No matter how far away I may be, I shall hear it, and will come at once to you " Next morning when the King had gone out to hunt, his four other Queens came to see the gardener\'s daughter  She told them all about her kettle-drum  "Oh," they said, "do drum on it just to see if the King really will come to you " "No, I will not," she said; "for why should I call him from his hunting when I do not want him?" "Don\'t mind interrupting his hunting," they answered  "Do try if he really will come to you when you beat your kettle-drum " So at last, just to please them, she beat it, and the King stood before her  "Why have you called me?" he said  "See, I have left my hunting to come to you " "I want nothing," she answered; "I only wished to know if you really would come to me when I beat my drum " "Very well," answered the King; "but do not call me again unless you really need me " Then he returned to his hunting', " The next day, when the King had gone out hunting as usual, the four Queens again came to see the gardener's daughter", ' They begged and begged her to beat her drum once more, "just to see if the King will really come to see you this time " At first she refused, but at last she consented  So she beat her drum, and the King came to her  There was a man in it long ago, and long ago it was, and if he was in it then he would not be in it now  He was married, and his wife was lost (i e , died), and he had only one son by the first wife  Then he married the second wife  This second wife had not much regard for the son, and he was obliged to go out on the mountain, far from the house, to take care of the cattle  There was a bracket (speckled) bull amongst the cows out on the mountain, and of a day that there was great hunger on the lad, the bracket bull heard him complaining and wringing his two hands, and he moved over to him and said to him, "You are hungry, but take the horn off me and lay it on the ground; put your hand into the place where the horn was and you will find food " When he heard that he went over to the bull, took hold of the horn, twisted it, and it came away with him in his hand  He laid it on the ground, put in his hand, and drew out food and drink and a table-cloth  He spread the table-cloth on the ground, set the food and drink on it, and then he ate and drank his enough  When he had his enough eaten and drunk, he put the table-cloth back again, and left the horn back in the place where it was before  When he came home that evening he did not eat a bit of his supper, and his stepmother said to herself that he (must have) got something to eat out on the mountain since he was not eating any of his supper  When he went out with his cattle the next day his stepmother sent her own daughter out after him, and told her to be watching him till she should see where he was getting the food  The daughter went and put herself in hiding, and she was watching him until the heat of the day came: but when the middle of the day was come she heard every music more excellent than another, and she was put to sleep by that truly melodious music  The bull came then, and the lad twisted the horn off him and drew out the table-cloth, the food, and the drink, and ate and drunk his enough  He put back the horn again then  The music was stopped and the daughter woke up, and was watching him until the evening came, and he drove the cows home then  The mother asked her did she see anything in the field, and she said that she did not  The lad did not eat two bites of his supper, and there was wonder on the stepmother  The next day when he drove out the cows the stepmother told the second daughter to follow him, and to be watching him till she would see where he was getting things to eat  The daughter followed him and put herself in hiding, but when the heat of the day came the music began and she fell asleep  The lad took the horn off the bull, drew out the table-cloth, the food, and drink, ate and drank his enough, and put back the horn again  The girl woke then, and was watching him until the evening  When the evening came he drove the cows home, and he was not able to eat his supper any more than the two evenings before  The stepmother asked the daughter did she see anything, and she said she did not  There was wonder on the stepmother  The next day, when the lad went out herding the cows, the stepmother sent the third daughter out after him, and threatened her not to fall asleep, but to have a good watch  The daughter followed the lad, and went into hiding  This daughter had three eyes, for she had an eye in the back of her head  When the bracket bull began playing every music more excellent than another, he put the other eyes to sleep, but he was not able to put the third eye to sleep There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon  They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue  The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, "Tin soldiers!" uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off  They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up  The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable  The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle  Through the small windows the rooms could be seen  In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake  Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were reflected in it  All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf  In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face  The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg  "That is the wife for me," he thought; "but she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no place for her  Still I must try and make her acquaintance " Then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance  When evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed  Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls  The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid  The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table  There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too  Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places  She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg  He never took his eyes from her for even a moment  The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; for the snuff-box was a toy puzzle  "Tin soldier," said the goblin, "don\'t wish for what does not belong to you " But the tin soldier pretended not to hear  "Very well; wait till to-morrow, then," said the goblin  When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window  Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath  It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards, his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air  There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was Svabhavak_ri_pa_n_a, which means "a born miser " He had collected a quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled a pot with what was left over  He hung the pot on a peg on the wall, placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he thought, "Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice  Now, if there should be a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it  With this I shall buy a couple of goats  They will have young ones every six months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats  Then, with the goats, I shall buy cows  As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the calves  Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the buffaloes, mares  When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold  With that gold I shall get a house with four wings  And then a Brahman will come to my house, and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry  She will have a son, and I shall call him Somasarman', " When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boy will see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to be danced on my knee", " He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, full of anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby; take him!' But she, distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me", ' Then I get up, and give her such a kick with my foot " While he thought this, he gave a kick with his foot, and broke the pot  All the rice fell over him, and made him quite white  Therefore, I say, "He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over, like the father of Somasarman "     There was once a king in Ireland, and he had three daughters, and very nice princesses they were  And one day, when they and their father were walking on the lawn, the king began to joke with them, and to ask them whom they would like to be married to', " 'I'll have the king of Ulster for a husband,' says one; 'and I'll have the king of Munster,' says another; 'and,' says the youngest, 'I'll have no husband but the Brown Bear of Norway", "' For a nurse of hers used to be telling her of an enchanted prince that she called by that name, and she fell in love with him, and his name was the first name on her tongue, for the very night before she was dreaming of him", ' Well, one laughed, and another laughed, and they joked with the princess all the rest of the evening', " But that very night she woke up out of her sleep in a great hall that was lighted up with a thousand lamps; the richest carpets were on the floor, and the walls were covered with cloth of gold and silver, and the place was full of grand company, and the very beautiful prince she saw in her dreams was there, and it wasn't a moment till he was on one knee before her, and telling her how much he loved her, and asking her wouldn't she be his queen", " Well, she hadn't the heart to refuse him, and married they were the same evening", " 'Now, my darling,' says he, when they were left by themselves, 'you must know that I am under enchantment", ' A sorceress, that had a beautiful daughter, wished me for her son-in-law; but the mother got power over me, and when I refused to wed her daughter she made me take the form of a bear by day, and I was to continue so till a lady would marry me of her own free will, and endure five years of great trials after', "' Well, when the princess woke in the morning, she missed her husband from her side, and spent the day very sadly", ' But as soon as the lamps were lighted in the grand hall, where she was sitting on a sofa covered with silk, the folding doors flew open, and he was sitting by her side the next minute', " So they spent another happy evening, but he warned her that whenever she began to tire of him, or ceased to have faith in him, they would be parted for ever, and he'd be obliged to marry the witch's daughter", " She got used to find him absent by day, and they spent a happy twelvemonth together, and at last a beautiful little boy was born; and happy as she was before, she was twice as happy now, for she had her child to keep her company in the day when she couldn't see her husband", " At last, one evening, when herself, and himself, and her child were sitting with a window open because it was a sultry night, in flew an eagle, took the infant's sash in his beak, and flew up in the air with him", ' She screamed, and was going to throw herself out the window after him, but the prince caught her, and looked at her very seriously  She bethought of what he said soon after their marriage, and she stopped the cries and complaints that were on her tongue  She spent her days very lonely for another twelvemonth, when a beautiful little girl was sent to her', " Then she thought to herself she'd have a sharp eye about her this time; so she never would allow a window to be more than a few inches open", ' But all her care was in vain', " Another evening, when they were all so happy, and the prince dandling the baby, a beautiful greyhound stood before them, took the child out of the father's hand, and was out of the door before you could wink", ' This time she shouted and ran out of the room, but there were some of the servants in the next room, and all declared that neither child nor dog passed out', " She felt, somehow, as if it was her husband's fault, but still she kept command over herself, and didn't once reproach him", " When the third child was born she would hardly allow a window or a door to be left open for a moment; but she wasn't the nearer to keep the child to herself", ' They were sitting one evening by the fire, when a lady appeared standing by them', " The princess opened her eyes in a great fright and stared at her, and while she was doing so, the lady wrapped a shawl round the baby that was sitting in its father's lap, and either sank through the ground with it or went up through the wide chimney", ' This time the mother kept her bed for a month', " 'My dear,' said she to her husband, when she was beginning to recover, 'I think I'd feel better if I was to see my father and mother and sisters once more", " If you give me leave to go home for a few days I'd be glad", "' 'Very well,' said he, 'I will do that, and whenever you feel inclined to return, only mention your wish when you lie down at night", "' The next morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber in her father's palace" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived in France a man whose name was Jalm Riou  You might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more contented, for he had a large farm, plenty of money, and above all, a daughter called Barbaik, the most graceful dancer and the best-dressed girl in the whole country side', " When she appeared on holidays in her embroidered cap, five petticoats, each one a little shorter than the other, and shoes with silver buckles, the women were all filled with envy, but little cared Barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl", " Now amongst all the young men who wanted to marry Barbaik, the one whose heart was most set on her was her father's head man, but as his manners were rough and he was exceedingly ugly she would have nothing to say to him, and, what was worse, often made fun of him with the rest", ' Jegu, for that was his name, of course heard of this, and it made him very unhappy  Still he would not leave the farm, and look for work elsewhere, as he might have done, for then he would never see Barbaik at all, and what was life worth to him without that? One evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields, and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink', " He was tired with a long day's work, and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals, waiting till they had done, and thinking all the while of Barbaik, when a voice came out of the gorse close by", " 'What is the matter, Jegu? You mustn't despair yet", "' The young man glanced up in surprise, and asked who was there", " 'It is I, the brownie of the lake,' replied the voice", " 'But where are you?' inquired Jegu", " 'Look close, and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog", " I can take,' he added proudly, 'any shape I choose, and even, which is much harder, be invisible if I want to", "' 'Then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear,' replied Jegu", " 'Certainly, if you wish,' and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses, and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green", ' This transformation rather frightened Jegu, but the brownie bade him have no fears, for he would not do him any harm; indeed, he hoped that Jegu might find him of some use', " 'But why should you take all this interest in me?' asked the peasant suspiciously", " 'Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never forgotten,' answered the little fellow", " 'You know, I am sure, that the korigans who dwell in the White Corn country have declared war on my people, because they say that they are the friends of man", ' We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant lands, and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes  Since that time, partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we have continued to transform ourselves, and it was in this way that I got to know you', "' 'How?' exclaimed Jegu, filled with astonishment", " 'Do you remember when you were digging in the field near the river, three months ago, you found a robin redbreast caught in a net? 'Yes,' answered Jegu, 'I remember it very well, and I opened the net and let him go", "' 'Well, I was that robin redbreast, and ever since I have vowed to be your friend, and as you want to marry Barbaik, I will prove the truth of what I say by helping you to do so", "' 'Ah! my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won't give you, except my soul", "' 'Then let me alone,' rejoined the dwarf, 'and I promise you that in a very few months you shall be master of the farm and of Barbaik", "' 'But how are you going to do it?' exclaimed Jegu wonderingly", " 'That is my affair", ' Perhaps I may tell you later', " Meanwhile you just eat and sleep, and don't worry yourself about anything" ,  ' Long, long ago, far, far away on the other side of the world, some young men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and children  The sun was hot, but they liked heat, and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest, or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang, which always returns to the thrower  They did not get on very fast at this rate, but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water, but was now, in the height of summer, only a set of pools, each surrounded with a fringe of plants, with bulrushes standing in the inside of all  In that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes, which they think as good as onions, and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp', " It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket, and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out: 'After all, why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children? Let them come and get the roots for themselves; but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get", "' This delighted the rest of the party, and they all began to arrange their fishing lines, made from the bark of the yellow mimosa, and to search for bait for their hooks", ' Most of them used worms, but one, who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet, cut off a little bit and baited his line with it, unseen by his companions  For a long time they cast patiently, without receiving a single bite; the sun had grown low in the sky, and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed, not even with a basket of roots to show; when the youth, who had baited his hook with raw meat, suddenly saw his line disappear under the water  Something, a very heavy fish he supposed, was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet, and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool  He cried to his friends to help him, and at last, trembling with fright at what they were going to see, they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal, but something of both, with a long, broad tail  They looked at each other with horror, cold shivers running down their spines; for though they had never beheld it, there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was--the cub of the awful Bunyip! All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail, answered by another from the other side of the pool, as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them, rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes', " 'Let it go! let it go!' whispered the young men to each other; but the captor declared that he had caught it, and was going to keep it", " 'He had promised his sweetheart,' he said, 'that he would bring back enough meat for her father's house to feast on for three days, and though they could not eat the little Bunyip, her brothers and sisters should have it to play with", "' So, flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back, he threw the little Bunyip on to his shoulders, and set out for the camp, never heeding the poor mother's cries of distress", ' By this time it was getting near sunset, and the plain was in shadow, though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright  The youths had all ceased to be afraid, when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them, and, looking round, saw that the pool was slowly rising, and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered', " 'What could it be?' they asked one of another; 'there was not a cloud in the sky, yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it do before", "' For an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen, then they turned and ran with all their might, the man with the Bunyip running faster than all", ' When he reached a high peak over-looking all the plain he stopped to take breath, and turned to see if he was safe yet  Safe! why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of water, and these were fast disappearing  They must run fast indeed if they were to escape  So on they flew, scarcely feeling the ground as they went, till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes scooped out of the earth where they had all been born  The old men were sitting in front, the children were playing, and the women chattering together, when the little Bunyip fell into their midst, and there was scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible was upon them', " 'The water! the water!' gasped one of the young men; and there it was, slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself", " Parents and children clung together, as if by that means they could drive back the advancing flood; and the youth who had caused all this terrible catastrophe, seized his sweetheart, and cried: 'I will climb with you to the top of that tree, and there no waters can reach us", "' But, as he spoke, something cold touched him, and quickly he glanced down at his feet", " Then with a shudder he saw that they were feet no longer, but bird's claws", ' He looked at the girl he was clasping, and beheld a great black bird standing at his side; he turned to his friends, but a flock of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place He put up his hands to cover his face, but they were no more hands, only the ends of wings; and when he tried to speak, a noise such as he had never heard before seemed to come from his throat, which had suddenly become narrow and slender  Already the water had risen to his waist, and he found himself sitting easily upon it, while its surface reflected back the image of a black swan, one of many', " Never again did the swans become men; but they are still different from other swans, for in the night-time those who listen can hear them talk in a language that is certainly not swan's language; and there are even sounds of laughing and talking, unlike any noise made by the swans whom we know" ,  ' Jim was the son of a cowboy, and lived on the broad plains of Arizona  His father had trained him to lasso a bronco or a young bull with perfect accuracy, and had Jim possessed the strength to back up his skill he would have been as good a cowboy as any in all Arizona', " When he was twelve years old he made his first visit to the east, where Uncle Charles, his father's brother, lived", ' Of course Jim took his lasso with him, for he was proud of his skill in casting it, and wanted to show his cousins what a cowboy could do  At first the city boys and girls were much interested in watching Jim lasso posts and fence pickets, but they soon tired of it, and even Jim decided it was not the right sort of sport for cities  But one day the butcher asked Jim to ride one of his horses into the country, to a pasture that had been engaged, and Jim eagerly consented  He had been longing for a horseback ride, and to make it seem like old times he took his lasso with him', " He rode through the streets demurely enough, but on reaching the open country roads his spirits broke forth into wild jubilation, and, urging the butcher's horse to full gallop, he dashed away in true cowboy fashion", " Then he wanted still more liberty, and letting down the bars that led into a big field he began riding over the meadow and throwing his lasso at imaginary cattle, while he yelled and whooped to his heart's content", ' Suddenly, on making a long cast with his lasso, the loop caught upon something and rested about three feet from the ground, while the rope drew taut and nearly pulled Jim from his horse  This was unexpected  More than that, it was wonderful; for the field seemed bare of even a stump  Jim\'s eyes grew big with amazement, but he knew he had caught something when a voice cried out: "Here, let go! Let go, I say! Can\'t you see what you\'ve done?" No, Jim couldn\'t see, nor did he intend to let go until he found out what was holding the loop of the lasso', " So he resorted to an old trick his father had taught him and, putting the butcher's horse to a run, began riding in a circle around the spot where his lasso had caught", ' As he thus drew nearer and nearer his quarry he saw the rope coil up, yet it looked to be coiling over nothing but air  One end of the lasso was made fast to a ring in the saddle, and when the rope was almost wound up and the horse began to pull away and snort with fear, Jim dismounted  Holding the reins of the bridle in one hand, he followed the rope, and an instant later saw an old man caught fast in the coils of the lasso  His head was bald and uncovered, but long white whiskers grew down to his waist  About his body was thrown a loose robe of fine white linen  In one hand he bore a great scythe, and beneath the other arm he carried an hourglass  While Jim gazed wonderingly upon him, this venerable old man spoke in an angry voice: "Now, then--get that rope off as fast as you can! You\'ve brought everything on earth to a standstill by your foolishness! Well--what are you staring at? Don\'t you know who I am?" "No," said Jim, stupidly  "Well, I\'m Time--Father Time! Now, make haste and set me free--if you want the world to run properly " "How did I happen to catch you?" asked Jim, without making a move to release his captive  "I don\'t know  I\'ve never been caught before," growled Father Time  "But I suppose it was because you were foolishly throwing your lasso at nothing " "I didn\'t see you," said Jim  "Of course you didn\'t', " I'm invisible to the eyes of human beings unless they get within three feet of me, and I take care to keep more than that distance away from them", " That's why I was crossing this field, where I supposed no one would be" ,  ' Peronnik was a poor idiot who belonged to nobody, and he would have died of starvation if it had not been for the kindness of the village people, who gave him food whenever he chose to ask for it  And as for a bed, when night came, and he grew sleepy, he looked about for a heap of straw, and making a hole in it, crept in, like a lizard  Idiot though he was, he was never unhappy, but always thanked gratefully those who fed him, and sometimes would stop for a little and sing to them  For he could imitate a lark so well, that no one knew which was Peronnik and which was the bird  He had been wandering in a forest one day for several hours, and when evening approached, he suddenly felt very hungry  Luckily, just at that place the trees grew thinner, and he could see a small farmhouse a little way off', " Peronnik went straight towards it, and found the farmer's wife standing at the door holding in her hands the large bowl out of which her children had eaten their supper", " 'I am hungry, will you give me something to eat?' asked the boy", " 'If you can find anything here, you are welcome to it,' answered she, and, indeed, there was not much left, as everybody's spoon had dipped in", ' But Peronnik ate what was there with a hearty appetite, and thought that he had never tasted better food', " 'It is made of the finest flour and mixed with the richest milk and stirred by the best cook in all the countryside,' and though he said it to himself, the woman heard him", " 'Poor innocent,' she murmured, 'he does not know what he is saying, but I will cut him a slice of that new wheaten loaf,' and so she did, and Peronnik ate up every crumb, and declared that nobody less than the bishop's baker could have baked it", " This flattered the farmer's wife so much that she gave him some butter to spread on it, and Peronnik was still eating it on the doorstep when an armed knight rode up", " 'Can you tell me the way to the castle of Kerglas?' asked he", " 'To Kerglas? are you really going to Kerglas?' cried the woman, turning pale", " 'Yes; and in order to get there I have come from a country so far off that it has taken me three months' hard riding to travel as far as this", "' 'And why do you want to go to Kerglas?' said she", " 'I am seeking the basin of gold and the lance of diamonds which are in the castle,' he answered", ' Then Peronnik looked up', " 'The basin and the lance are very costly things,' he said suddenly", " 'More costly and precious than all the crowns in the world,' replied the stranger, 'for not only will the basin furnish you with the best food that you can dream of, but if you drink of it, it will cure you of any illness however dangerous, and will even bring the dead back to life, if it touches their mouths", ' As to the diamond lance, that will cut through any stone or metal', "' 'And to whom do these wonders belong?' asked Peronnik in amazement", " 'To a magician named Rogear who lives in the castle,' answered the woman", " 'Every day he passes along here, mounted on a black mare, with a colt thirteen months old trotting behind", ' But no one dares to attack him, as he always carries his lance', "' 'That is true,' said the knight, 'but there is a spell laid upon him which forbids his using it within the castle of Kerglas", ' The moment he enters, the basin and lance are put away in a dark cellar which no key but one can open  And that is the place where I wish to fight the magician', "' 'You will never overcome him, Sir Knight,' replied the woman, shaking her head" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty, with a skin as soft and shining as silk, and wise green eyes, that could see even in the dark  His name was Gon, and he belonged to a music teacher, who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world', " Now not far from the music master's house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma", " She was such a little dear altogether, and blinked her eyes so daintily, and ate her supper so tidily, and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue, that her mistress was never tired of saying, 'Koma, Koma, what should I do without you?' Well, it happened one day that these two, when out for an evening stroll, met under a cherry tree, and in one moment fell madly in love with each other", ' Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife, for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy; but he was not easy to please, and did not care about any of them  Now, before he had time to think, Cupid had entangled him in his net, and he was filled with love towards Koma  She fully returned his passion, but, like a woman, she saw the difficulties in the way, and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them  Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma, but her mistress would not part from her  Then the music master was asked to sell Gon to the lady, but he declined to listen to any such suggestion, so everything remained as before  At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves, and to seek their fortunes together  So one moonlight night they stole away, and ventured out into an unknown world  All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine, till they had left their homes far behind them, and towards evening they found themselves in a large park  The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired, and the grass looked very soft and inviting, and the trees cast cool deep shadows, when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise, in the shape of a big, big dog! He came springing towards them showing all his teeth, and Koma shrieked, and rushed up a cherry tree', " Gon, however, stood his ground boldly, and prepared to give battle, for he felt that Koma's eyes were upon him, and that he must not run away", ' But, alas! his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him, for he was large and powerful, and very fierce  From her perch in the tree Koma saw it all, and screamed with all her might, hoping that some one would hear, and come to help  Luckily a servant of the princess to whom the park belonged was walking by, and he drove off the dog, and picking up the trembling Gon in his arms, carried him to his mistress  So poor little Koma was left alone, while Gon was borne away full of trouble, not in the least knowing what to do  Even the attention paid him by the princess, who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways, did not console him, but there was no use in fighting against fate, and he could only wait and see what would turn up', " The princess, Gon's new mistress, was so good and kind that everybody loved her, and she would have led a happy life, had it not been for a serpent who had fallen in love with her, and was constantly annoying her by his presence", ' Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as he appeared; but as they were careless, and the serpent very sly, it sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them, and to frighten the princess by appearing before her  One day she was seated in her room, playing on her favourite musical instrument, when she felt something gliding up her sash, and saw her enemy making his way to kiss her cheek  She shrieked and threw herself backwards, and Gon, who had been curled up on a stool at her feet, understood her terror, and with one bound seized the snake by his neck  He gave him one bite and one shake, and flung him on the ground, where he lay, never to worry the princess any more  Then she took Gon in her arms, and praised and caressed him, and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat, and the softest mats to lie on; and he would have had nothing in the world to wish for if only he could have seen Koma again  Time passed on, and one morning Gon lay before the house door, basking in the sun  He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him, and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and ill-treating quite a little one  He jumped up, full of rage, and chased away the big cat, and then he turned to comfort the little one, when his heart nearly burst with joy to find that it was Koma  At first Koma did not know him again, he had grown so large and stately; but when it dawned upon her who it was, her happiness knew no bounds  And they rubbed their heads and their noses again and again, while their purring might have been heard a mile off  A cat had made acquaintance with a mouse, and had spoken so much of the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at last the Mouse consented to live in the same house with her, and to go shares in the housekeeping', " 'But we must provide for the winter or else we shall suffer hunger,' said the Cat", " 'You, little Mouse, cannot venture everywhere in case you run at last into a trap", "' This good counsel was followed, and a little pot of fat was bought", ' But they did not know where to put it', " At length, after long consultation, the Cat said, 'I know of no place where it could be better put than in the church", ' No one will trouble to take it away from there', " We will hide it in a corner, and we won't touch it till we are in want", "' So the little pot was placed in safety; but it was not long before the Cat had a great longing for it, and said to the Mouse, 'I wanted to tell you, little Mouse, that my cousin has a little son, white with brown spots, and she wants me to be godmother to it", ' Let me go out to-day, and do you take care of the house alone', "' 'Yes, go certainly,' replied the Mouse, 'and when you eat anything good, think of me; I should very much like a drop of the red christening wine", "' But it was all untrue", ' The Cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother  She went straight to the church, slunk to the little pot of fat, began to lick it, and licked the top off  Then she took a walk on the roofs of the town, looked at the view, stretched herself out in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the little pot of fat  As soon as it was evening she went home again', " 'Ah, here you are again!' said the Mouse; 'you must certainly have had an enjoyable day", "' 'It went off very well,' answered the Cat", " 'What was the child's name?' asked the Mouse", " 'Top Off,' said the Cat drily", " 'Topoff!' echoed the Mouse, 'it is indeed a wonderful and curious name", " Is it in your family?' 'What is there odd about it?' said the Cat", " 'It is not worse than Breadthief, as your godchild is called", "' Not long after this another great longing came over the Cat", " She said to the Mouse, 'You must again be kind enough to look after the house alone, for I have been asked a second time to stand godmother, and as this child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse", "' The kind Mouse agreed, but the Cat slunk under the town wall to the church, and ate up half of the pot of fat", " 'Nothing tastes better,' said she, 'than what one eats by oneself,' and she was very much pleased with her day's work", " When she came home the Mouse asked, 'What was this child called?' 'Half Gone,' answered the Cat", " 'Halfgone! what a name! I have never heard it in my life", " I don't believe it is in the calendar" ,  ' If you drop Vladimir by mistake, you know he always falls on his feet  And if Vladimir tumbles off the roof of the hut, he always falls on his feet  Cats always fall on their feet, on their four paws, and never hurt themselves  And as in tumbling, so it is in life  No cat is ever unfortunate for very long  The worse things look for a cat, the better they are going to be  Well, once upon a time, not so very long ago, an old peasant had a cat and did not like him  He was a tom-cat, always fighting; and he had lost one ear, and was not very pretty to look at  The peasant thought he would get rid of his old cat, and buy a new one from a neighbour  He did not care what became of the old tom-cat with one ear, so long as he never saw him again', " It was no use thinking of killing him, for it is a life's work to kill a cat, and it's likely enough that the cat would come alive at the end", ' So the old peasant he took a sack, and he bundled the tom-cat into the sack, and he sewed up the sack and slung it over his back, and walked off into the forest  Off he went, trudging along in the summer sunshine, deep into the forest  And when he had gone very many versts into the forest, he took the sack with the cat in it and threw it away among the trees  "You stay there," says he, "and if you do get out in this desolate place, much good may it do you, old quarrelsome bundle of bones and fur!" And with that he turned round and trudged home again, and bought a nice-looking, quiet cat from a neighbour in exchange for a little tobacco, and settled down comfortably at home with the new cat in front of the stove; and there he may be to this day, so far as I know  My story does not bother with him, but only with the old tom-cat tied up in the sack away there out in the forest  The bag flew through the air, and plumped down through a bush to the ground  And the old tom-cat landed on his feet inside it, very much frightened but not hurt  Thinks he, this bag, this flight through the air, this bump, mean that my life is going to change  Very well; there is nothing like something new now and again  And presently he began tearing at the bag with his sharp claws  Soon there was a hole he could put a paw through  He went on, tearing and scratching, and there was a hole he could put two paws through  He went on with his work, and soon he could put his head through, all the easier because he had only one ear  A minute or two after that he had wriggled out of the bag, and stood up on his four paws and stretched himself in the forest  "The world seems to be larger than the village," he said  "I will walk on and see what there is in it " He washed himself all over, curled his tail proudly up in the air, cocked the only ear he had left, and set off walking under the forest trees  "I was the head-cat in the village," says he to himself  "If all goes well, I shall be head here too  A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade him go to another country and try his luck in trade  The son took the money and departed  He had not gone far before he came across some herdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill  "Please do not kill the dog," pleaded the young and tender-hearted fellow; "I will give you one hundred rupees for it " Then and there, of course, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the dog, and continued his journey  He next met with some people fighting about a cat  Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not  "Oh! please do not kill it," said he; "I will give you one hundred rupees for it " Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money  He went on till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a snake that had just been caught  Some of them wished to kill it, but others did not  "Please do not kill the snake," said he; "I will give you one hundred rupees " Of course the people agreed, and were highly delighted  What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was gone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went home  "You fool! You scamp!" exclaimed his father when he had heard how his son had wasted all the money that had been given to him  "Go and live in the stables and repent of your folly  You shall never again enter my house " So the young man went and lived in the stables  His bed was the grass spread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and the snake, which he had purchased so dearly  These creatures got very fond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by him at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head, and the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its tail on the other  One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, "I am the son of Raja Indrasha  One day, when I had come out of the ground to drink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had you not most opportunely arrived to my rescue  I do not know how I shall ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me  Would that you knew my father! How glad he would be to see his son\'s preserver!" "Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible," said the young man  "Well said!" continued the snake  "Do you see yonder mountain? At the bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring', " If you will come with me and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father's country", ' Oh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too  But how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to accept something at his hand', " If he asks you what you would like, you would, perhaps, do well to reply, 'The ring on your right hand, and the famous pot and spoon which you possess" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a queen whose heart was sore because she had no children  She was sad enough when her husband was at home with her, but when he was away she would see nobody, but sat and wept all day long  Now it happened that a war broke out with the king of a neighbouring country, and the queen was left in the palace alone  She was so unhappy that she felt as if the walls would stifle her, so she wandered out into the garden, and threw herself down on a grassy bank, under the shade of a lime tree  She had been there for some time, when a rustle among the leaves caused her to look up, and she saw an old woman limping on her crutches towards the stream that flowed through the grounds', " When she had quenched her thirst, she came straight up to the queen, and said to her: 'Do not take it evil, noble lady, that I dare to speak to you, and do not be afraid of me, for it may be that I shall bring you good luck", "' The queen looked at her doubtfully, and answered: 'You do not seem as if you had been very lucky yourself, or to have much good fortune to spare for anyone else", "' 'Under rough bark lies smooth wood and sweet kernel,' replied the old woman", " 'Let me see your hand, that I may read the future", "' The queen held out her hand, and the old woman examined its lines closely", " Then she said, 'Your heart is heavy with two sorrows, one old and one new", ' The new sorrow is for your husband, who is fighting far away from you; but, believe me, he is well, and will soon bring you joyful news  But your other sorrow is much older than this  Your happiness is spoilt because you have no children', "' At these words the queen became scarlet, and tried to draw away her hand, but the old woman said: 'Have a little patience, for there are some things I want to see more clearly", "' 'But who are you?' asked the queen, 'for you seem to be able to read my heart", "' 'Never mind my name,' answered she, 'but rejoice that it is permitted to me to show you a way to lessen your grief", ' You must, however, promise to do exactly what I tell you, if any good is to come of it', "' 'Oh, I will obey you exactly,' cried the queen, 'and if you can help me you shall have in return anything you ask for", "' The old woman stood thinking for a little: then she drew something from the folds of her dress, and, undoing a number of wrappings, brought out a tiny basket made of birch-bark", " She held it out to the queen, saying, 'In the basket you will find a bird's egg", ' This you must be careful to keep in a warm place for three months, when it will turn into a doll  Lay the doll in a basket lined with soft wool, and leave it alone, for it will not need any food, and by-and-by you will find it has grown to be the size of a baby  Then you will have a baby of your own, and you must put it by the side of the other child, and bring your husband to see his son and daughter  The boy you will bring up yourself, but you must entrust the little girl to a nurse  When the time comes to have them christened you will invite me to be godmother to the princess, and this is how you must send the invitation', " Hidden in the cradle, you will find a goose's wing: throw this out of the window, and I will be with you directly; but be sure you tell no one of all the things that have befallen you", "' The queen was about to reply, but the old woman was already limping away, and before she had gone two steps she had turned into a young girl, who moved so quickly that she seemed rather to fly than to walk", ' The queen, watching this transformation, could hardly believe her eyes, and would have taken it all for a dream, had it not been for the basket which she held in her hand  Feeling a different being from the poor sad woman who had wandered into the garden so short a time before, she hastened to her room, and felt carefully in the basket for the egg  Once upon a time there lived an old man who dwelt with his son in a small hut on the edge of the plain  He was very old, and had worked very hard, and when at last he was struck down by illness he felt that he should never rise from his bed again  So, one day, he bade his wife summon their son, when he came back from his journey to the nearest town, where he had been to buy bread', " 'Come hither, my son,' said he; 'I know myself well to be dying, and I have nothing to leave you but my falcon, my cat and my greyhound; but if you make good use of them you will never lack food", ' Be good to your mother, as you have been to me', " And now farewell!' Then he turned his face to the wall and died", ' There was great mourning in the hut for many days, but at length the son rose up, and calling to his greyhound, his cat and his falcon, he left the house saying that he would bring back something for dinner  Wandering over the plain, he noticed a troop of gazelles, and pointed to his greyhound to give chase  The dog soon brought down a fine fat beast, and slinging it over his shoulders, the young man turned homewards  On the way, however, he passed a pond, and as he approached a cloud of birds flew into the air  Shaking his wrist, the falcon seated on it darted into the air, and swooped down upon the quarry he had marked, which fell dead to the ground  The young man picked it up, and put it in his pouch and then went towards home again  Near the hut was a small barn in which he kept the produce of the little patch of corn, which grew close to the garden  Here a rat ran out almost under his feet, followed by another and another; but quick as thought the cat was upon them and not one escaped her  When all the rats were killed, the young man left the barn  He took the path leading to the door of the hut, but stopped on feeling a hand laid on his shoulder', " 'Young man,' said the ogre (for such was the stranger), 'you have been a good son, and you deserve the piece of luck which has befallen you this day", ' Come with me to that shining lake yonder, and fear nothing', "' Wondering a little at what might be going to happen to him, the youth did as the ogre bade him, and when they reached the shore of the lake, the ogre turned and said to him: 'Step into the water and shut your eyes! You will find yourself sinking slowly to the bottom; but take courage, all will go well", ' Only bring up as much silver as you can carry, and we will divide it between us', "' So the young man stepped bravely into the lake, and felt himself sinking, sinking, till he reached firm ground at last", ' In front of him lay four heaps of silver, and in the midst of them a curious white shining stone, marked over with strange characters, such as he had never seen before  He picked it up in order to examine it more closely, and as he held it the stone spoke', " 'As long as you hold me, all your wishes will come true,' it said", " 'But hide me in your turban, and then call to the ogre that you are ready to come up", "' In a few minutes the young man stood again by the shores of the lake", " 'Well, where is the silver?' asked the ogre, who was awaiting him", " 'Ah, my father, how can I tell you! So bewildered was I, and so dazzled with the splendours of everything I saw, that I stood like a statue, unable to move", ' Then hearing steps approaching I got frightened, and called to you, as you know', "' 'You are no better than the rest,' cried the ogre, and turned away in a rage" ,  ' About this time the gentlemen whom the king had left behind him to watch over the princess had each occasion to doubt the testimony of his own eyes, for more than strange were the objects to which they would bear witness', " They were of one sort--creatures--but so grotesque and misshapen as to be more like a child's drawings upon his slate than anything natural", ' They saw them only at night, while on guard about the house  The testimony of the man who first reported having seen one of them was that, as he was walking slowly round the house, while yet in the shadow, he caught sight of a creature standing on its hind legs in the moonlight, with its forefeet upon a window-ledge, staring in at the window  Its body might have been that of a dog or wolf, he thought, but he declared on his honour that its head was twice the size it ought to have been for the size of its body, and as round as a ball, while the face, which it turned upon him as it fled, was more like one carved by a boy upon the turnip inside which he is going to put a candle than anything else he could think of  It rushed into the garden  He sent an arrow after it, and thought he must have struck it; for it gave an unearthly howl, and he could not find his arrow any more than the beast, although he searched all about the place where it vanished  They laughed at him until he was driven to hold his tongue, and said he must have taken too long a pull at the ale-jug  But before two nights were over he had one to side with him, for he, too, had seen something strange, only quite different from that reported by the other  The description the second man gave of the creature he had seen was yet more grotesque and unlikely  They were both laughed at by the rest; but night after night another came over to their side, until at last there was only one left to laugh at all his companions  Two nights more passed, and he saw nothing; but on the third he came rushing from the garden to the other two before the house, in such an agitation that they declared--for it was their turn now--that the band of his helmet was cracking under his chin with the rising of his hair inside it  Running with him into that part of the garden which I have already described, they saw a score of creatures, to not one of which they could give a name, and not one of which was like another, hideous and ludicrous at once, gambolling on the lawn in the moonlight  The supernatural or rather subnatural ugliness of their faces, the length of legs and necks in some, the apparent absence of both or either in others, made the spectators, although in one consent as to what they saw, yet doubtful, as I have said, of the evidence of their own eyes--and ears as well; for the noises they made, although not loud, were as uncouth and varied as their forms, and could be described neither as grunts nor squeaks nor roars nor howls nor barks nor yells nor screams nor croaks nor hisses nor mews nor shrieks, but only as something like all of them mingled in one horrible dissonance  Keeping in the shade, the watchers had a few moments to recover themselves before the hideous assembly suspected their presence; but all at once, as if by common consent, they scampered off in the direction of a great rock, and vanished before the men had come to themselves sufficiently to think of following them  My readers will suspect what these were; but I will now give them full information concerning them  They were, of course, household animals belonging to the goblins, whose ancestors had taken their ancestors many centuries before from the upper regions of light into the lower regions of darkness  The original stocks of these horrible creatures were very much the same as the animals now seen about farms and homes in the country, with the exception of a few of them, which had been wild creatures, such as foxes, and indeed wolves and small bears, which the goblins, from their proclivity towards the animal creation, had caught when cubs and tamed  But in the course of time all had undergone even greater changes than had passed upon their owners  They had altered--that is, their descendants had altered--into such creatures as I have not attempted to describe except in the vaguest manner--the various parts of their bodies assuming, in an apparently arbitrary and self-willed manner, the most abnormal developments  Indeed, so little did any distinct type predominate in some of the bewildering results, that you could only have guessed at any known animal as the original, and even then, what likeness remained would be more one of general expression than of definable conformation  But what increased the gruesomeness tenfold was that, from constant domestic, or indeed rather family association with the goblins, their countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human  No one understands animals who does not see that every one of them, even amongst the fishes, it may be with a dimness and vagueness infinitely remote, yet shadows the human: in the case of these the human resemblance had greatly increased: while their owners had sunk towards them, they had risen towards their owners  But the conditions of subterranean life being equally unnatural for both, while the goblins were worse, the creatures had not improved by the approximation, and its result would have appeared far more ludicrous than consoling to the warmest lover of animal nature', " I shall now explain how it was that just then these animals began to show themselves about the king's country house", ' The goblins, as Curdie had discovered, were mining on--at work both day and night, in divisions, urging the scheme after which he lay in wait  In the course of their tunnelling they had broken into the channel of a small stream, but the break being in the top of it, no water had escaped to interfere with their work  Some of the creatures, hovering as they often did about their masters, had found the hole, and had, with the curiosity which had grown to a passion from the restraints of their unnatural circumstances, proceeded to explore the channel  The stream was the same which ran out by the seat on which Irene and her king-papa had sat as I have told, and the goblin creatures found it jolly fun to get out for a romp on a smooth lawn such as they had never seen in all their poor miserable lives  But although they had partaken enough of the nature of their owners to delight in annoying and alarming any of the people whom they met on the mountain, they were, of course, incapable of designs of their own, or of intentionally furthering those of their masters' ,  " It was the Eve of Samhain, which we Christians call All Hallows' Eve", ' The King of Ireland, Conn, the Hundred-Fighter, sat at supper in his palace at Tara  All his chiefs and mighty men were with him  On his right hand was his only son, Art the Solitary, so called because he had no brothers  The sons of Morna, who kept the boy Finn out of his rights and were at the time trying to kill him if they could, were here too', " Chief amongst them was Gaul mac Morna, a huge and strong warrior, and Captain of all the Fians ever since that battle in which Finn's father had been killed", " And Gaul's men were with him", ' The great long table was spread for supper  A thousand wax candles shed their light through the chamber, and caused the vessels of gold, silver, and bronze to shine  Yet, though it was a great feast, none of these warriors seemed to care about eating or drinking; every face was sad, and there was little conversation, and no music  It seemed as if they were expecting some calamity', " Conn's sceptre, which was a plain staff of silver, lay beside him on the table, and there was a canopy of bright bronze over his head", ' Gaul mac Morna, Captain of the Fians, sat at the other end of the long table  Every warrior wore a bright banqueting mantle of silk or satin, scarlet or crimson, blue, green, or purple, fastened on the breast either with a great brooch or with a pin of gold or silver  Yet, though their raiment was bright and gay, and though all the usual instruments of festivity were there, and a thousand tall candles shed their light over the scene, no one looked happy  Then was heard a low sound like thunder, and the earth seemed to tremble, and after that they distinctly heard a footfall like the slow, deliberate tread of a giant  These footfalls sent a chill into every heart, and every face, gloomy before, was now pale  The King leaned past his son Art the Solitary, and said to a certain Druid who sat beside Art, "Is this the son of Midna come before his time?" "It is not," said the Druid, "but it is the man who is to conquer Midna  One is coming to Tara this night before whose glory all other glory shall wax dim " Shortly after that they heard the voices of the doorkeepers raised in contention, as if they would repel from the hall someone who wished to enter, then a slight scuffle, and after that a strange figure entered the chamber', " He was dressed in the skins of wild beasts, and wore over his shoulders a huge thick cloak of wild boars' skins, fastened on the breast with a white tusk of the same animal", ' He wore a shield and two spears  Though of huge stature his face was that of a boy, smooth on the cheeks and lips  It was white and ruddy, and very handsome  His hair was like refined gold  A light seemed to go out from him, before which the candles burned dim  It was Finn  He stood in the doorway, and cried out in a strong and sonorous, but musical, voice: "O Conn the Hundred-Fighter, son of Felimy, the righteous son of Tuthal the legitimate, O King of the Kings of Erin, a wronged and disinherited youth, possessing nowhere one rood of his patrimony, a wanderer and an outlaw, a hunter of the wildernesses and mountains, claims hospitality of thee, illustrious prince, on the eve of the great festival of Samhain " "Thou art welcome whoever thou art," answered the King, "and doubly welcome because thou art unfortunate  I think, such is thy face and form, that thou art the son of some mighty king on whom disaster has fallen undeserved  There was once a poor woman that had three daughters, and one day the eldest said, "Mother, bake my cake and kill my cock till I go seek my fortune " So she did, and when all was ready, says her mother to her, "Which will you have--half of these with my blessing, or the whole with my curse?" "Curse or no curse," says she, "the whole is little enough " So away she set, and if the mother didn\'t give her her curse, she didn\'t give her her blessing  She walked, and she walked, till she was tired and hungry, and then she sat down to take her dinner  While she was eating it a poor woman came up, and asked for a bit  "The dickens a bit you\'ll get from me," says she; "it\'s all too little for myself " And the poor woman walked away very sorrowful', " At nightfall she got lodging at a farmer's, and the woman of the house told her that she'd give her a spadeful of gold and a shovelful of silver if she'd only sit up and watch her son's corpse that was waking in the next room", " She said she'd do that, and so, when the family were in their bed, she sat by the fire, and cast an eye from time to time on the corpse that was lying under the table", ' All at once the dead man got up in his shroud, and stood before her, and said, "All alone, fair maid?" She gave him no answer; when he had said it the third time he struck her with a switch, and she became a grey flag', " About a week after, the second daughter went to seek her fortune, and she didn't care for her mother's blessing no more _nor_ her sister, and the very same thing happened to her", ' She was left a grey flag by the side of the other', " At last the youngest went off in search of the other two, and she took care to carry her mother's blessing with her", ' She shared her dinner with the poor woman on the road, and _she_ told her that she would watch over her  Well, she got lodging in the same place as the others, and agreed to mind the corpse  She sat up by the fire, with the dog and cat, and amused herself with some apples and nuts the mistress had given her  She thought it a pity that the man under the table was a corpse, he was so handsome  But at last he got up, and, says he, "All alone, fair maid?" and she wasn\'t long about an answer:  All alone I am not,  I\'ve little dog Douse, and Pussy, my cat;  I\'ve apples to roast and nuts to crack,  And all alone I am not  "Ho, ho!" says he, "you\'re a girl of courage, though you wouldn\'t have enough to follow me  I am now going to cross the quaking bog, and go through the burning forest  I must then enter the cave of terror and climb the hill of glass, and drop from the top of it into the Dead Sea " "I\'ll follow you," says she, "for I engaged to mind you " He thought to prevent her, but she was stiff as he was stout  Out he sprang through the window, and she followed him, till they came to the "Green Hills," and then says he:  "Open, open, Green Hills and let the light of the Green Hills through "  "Aye," says the girl, "and let the fair maid too " They opened, and the man and woman passed through, and there they were on the edge of a bog', " He trod lightly over the shaky bits of moss and sod; and while she was thinking of how she'd get across, the old beggar appeared to her, but much nicer dressed, touched her shoes with a stick, and the soles spread a foot on each side", ' So she easily got over the shaky marsh  The burning wood was at the edge of the bog, and there the good fairy flung a damp, thick cloak over her, and through the flames she went, and a hair of her head was not singed', " Then they passed through the dark cavern of horrors, when she'd have heard the most horrible yells, only that the fairy stopped her ears with wax" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife in a dirty, tumble-down cottage, not very far from the splendid palace where the king and queen dwelt  In spite of the wretched state of the hut, which many people declared was too bad even for a pig to live in, the old man was very rich, for he was a great miser, and lucky besides, and would often go without food all day sooner than change one of his beloved gold pieces  But after a while he found that he had starved himself once too often  He fell ill, and had no strength to get well again, and in a few days he died, leaving his wife and one son behind him', " The night following his death, the son dreamed that an unknown man appeared to him and said: 'Listen to me; your father is dead and your mother will soon die, and all their riches will belong to you", ' Half of his wealth is ill-gotten, and this you must give back to the poor from whom he squeezed it  The other half you must throw into the sea  Watch, however, as the money sinks into the water, and if anything should swim, catch it and keep it, even if it is nothing more than a bit of paper', "' Then the man vanished, and the youth awoke", ' The remembrance of his dream troubled him greatly  He did not want to part with the riches that his father had left him, for he had known all his life what it was to be cold and hungry, and now he had hoped for a little comfort and pleasure  Still, he was honest and good-hearted, and if his father had come wrongfully by his wealth he felt he could never enjoy it, and at last he made up his mind to do as he had been bidden  He found out who were the people who were poorest in the village, and spent half of his money in helping them, and the other half he put in his pocket  From a rock that jutted right out into the sea he flung it in  In a moment it was out of sight, and no man could have told the spot where it had sunk, except for a tiny scrap of paper floating on the water  He stretched down carefully and managed to reach it, and on opening it found six shillings wrapped inside  This was now all the money he had in the world  The young man stood and looked at it thoughtfully', " 'Well, I can't do much with this,' he said to himself; but, after all, six shillings were better than nothing, and he wrapped them up again and slipped them into his coat", ' He worked in his garden for the next few weeks, and he and his mother contrived to live on the fruit and vegetables he got out of it, and then she too died suddenly  The poor fellow felt very sad when he had laid her in her grave, and with a heavy heart he wandered into the forest, not knowing where he was going  By-and-by he began to get hungry, and seeing a small hut in front of him, he knocked at the door and asked if they could give him some milk', " The old woman who opened it begged him to come in, adding kindly, that if he wanted a night's lodging he might have it without its costing him anything", ' Two women and three men were at supper when he entered, and silently made room for him to sit down by them  When he had eaten he began to look about him, and was surprised to see an animal sitting by the fire different from anything he had ever noticed before  It was grey in colour, and not very big; but its eyes were large and very bright, and it seemed to be singing in an odd way, quite unlike any animal in the forest', " 'What is the name of that strange little creature?' asked he", " And they answered, 'We call it a cat", "' 'I should like to buy it--if it is not too dear,' said the young man; 'it would be company for me", "' And they told him that he might have it for six shillings, if he cared to give so much" ,  ' There was once a crab who lived in a hole on the shady side of a mountain  She was a very good housewife, and so careful and industrious that there was no creature in the whole country whose hole was so neat and clean as hers, and she took great pride in it  One day she saw lying near the mouth of her hole a handful of cooked rice which some pilgrim must have let fall when he was stopping to eat his dinner  Delighted at this discovery, she hastened to the spot, and was carrying the rice back to her hole when a monkey, who lived in some trees near by, came down to see what the crab was doing  His eyes shone at the sight of the rice, for it was his favourite food, and like the sly fellow he was, he proposed a bargain to the crab  She was to give him half the rice in exchange for the kernel of a sweet red kaki fruit which he had just eaten  He half expected that the crab would laugh in his face at this impudent proposal, but instead of doing so she only looked at him for a moment with her head on one side and then said that she would agree to the exchange  So the monkey went off with his rice, and the crab returned to her hole with the kernel  For some time the crab saw no more of the monkey, who had gone to pay a visit on the sunny side of the mountain; but one morning he happened to pass by her hole, and found her sitting under the shadow of a beautiful kaki tree', " 'Good day,' he said politely, 'you have some very fine fruit there! I am very hungry, could you spare me one or two?' 'Oh, certainly,' replied the crab, 'but you must forgive me if I cannot get them for you myself", ' I am no tree-climber', "' 'Pray do not apologise,' answered the monkey", " 'Now that I have your permission I can get them myself quite easily", "' And the crab consented to let him go up, merely saying that he must throw her down half the fruit", ' In another moment he was swinging himself from branch to branch, eating all the ripest kakis and filling his pockets with the rest, and the poor crab saw to her disgust that the few he threw down to her were either not ripe at all or else quite rotten', " 'You are a shocking rogue,' she called in a rage; but the monkey took no notice, and went on eating as fast as he could", ' The crab understood that it was no use her scolding, so she resolved to try what cunning would do', " 'Sir Monkey,' she said, 'you are certainly a very good climber, but now that you have eaten so much, I am quite sure you would never be able to turn one of your somersaults", "' The monkey prided himself on turning better somersaults than any of his family, so he instantly went head over heels three times on the bough on which he was sitting, and all the beautiful kakis that he had in his pockets rolled to the ground", ' Quick as lightning the crab picked them up and carried a quantity of them into her house, but when she came up for another the monkey sprang on her, and treated her so badly that he left her for dead  When he had beaten her till his arm ached he went his way  It was a lucky thing for the poor crab that she had some friends to come to her help or she certainly would have died then and there  The wasp flew to her, and took her back to bed and looked after her, and then he consulted with a rice-mortar and an egg which had fallen out of a nest near by, and they agreed that when the monkey returned, as he was sure to do, to steal the rest of the fruit, that they would punish him severely for the manner in which he had behaved to the crab  So the mortar climbed up to the beam over the front door, and the egg lay quite still on the ground, while the wasp set down the water-bucket in a corner  Then the crab dug itself a deep hole in the ground, so that not even the tip of her claws might be seen  Soon after everything was ready the monkey jumped down from his tree, and creeping to the door began a long hypocritical speech, asking pardon for all he had done  He waited for an answer of some sort, but none came  He listened, but all was still; then he peeped, and saw no one; then he went in  He peered about for the crab, but in vain; however, his eyes fell on the egg, which he snatched up and set on the fire  But in a moment the egg had burst into a thousand pieces, and its sharp shell struck him in the face and scratched him horribly  Once upon a time there were three Princesses who were all three young and beautiful; but the youngest, although she was not fairer than the other two, was the most loveable of them all  About half a mile from the palace in which they lived there stood a castle, which was uninhabited and almost a ruin, but the garden which surrounded it was a mass of blooming flowers, and in this garden the youngest Princess used often to walk  One day when she was pacing to and fro under the lime trees, a black crow hopped out of a rose-bush in front of her  The poor beast was all torn and bleeding, and the kind little Princess was quite unhappy about it', " When the crow saw this it turned to her and said: 'I am not really a black crow, but an enchanted Prince, who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery", ' If you only liked, Princess, you could save me  But you would have to say good-bye to all your own people and come and be my constant companion in this ruined castle', " There is one habitable room in it, in which there is a golden bed; there you will have to live all by yourself, and don't forget that whatever you may see or hear in the night you must not scream out, for if you give as much as a single cry my sufferings will be doubled", "' The good-natured Princess at once left her home and her family and hurried to the ruined castle, and took possession of the room with the golden bed", ' When night approached she lay down, but though she shut her eyes tight sleep would not come  At midnight she heard to her great horror some one coming along the passage, and in a minute her door was flung wide open and a troop of strange beings entered the room  They at once proceeded to light a fire in the huge fireplace; then they placed a great cauldron of boiling water on it  When they had done this, they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay, and, screaming and yelling all the time, they dragged her towards the cauldron  She nearly died with fright, but she never uttered a sound  Then of a sudden the cock crew, and all the evil spirits vanished  At the same moment the crow appeared and hopped all round the room with joy  It thanked the Princess most heartily for her goodness, and said that its sufferings had already been greatly lessened', " Now one of the Princess's elder sisters, who was very inquisitive, had found out about everything, and went to pay her youngest sister a visit in the ruined castle", ' She implored her so urgently to let her spend the night with her in the golden bed, that at last the good-natured little Princess consented  But at midnight, when the odd folk appeared, the elder sister screamed with terror, and from this time on the youngest Princess insisted always on keeping watch alone  So she lived in solitude all the daytime, and at night she would have been frightened, had she not been so brave; but every day the crow came and thanked her for her endurance, and assured her that his sufferings were far less than they had been', " And so two years passed away, when one day the crow came to the Princess and said: 'In another year I shall be freed from the spell I am under at present, because then the seven years will be over", ' But before I can resume my natural form, and take possession of the belongings of my forefathers, you must go out into the world and take service as a maidservant', "' The young Princess consented at once, and for a whole year she served as a maid; but in spite of her youth and beauty she was very badly treated, and suffered many things", ' One evening, when she was spinning flax, and had worked her little white hands weary, she heard a rustling beside her and a cry of joy  Then she saw a handsome youth standing beside her; who knelt down at her feet and kissed the little weary white hands', " 'I am the Prince,' he said, 'who you in your goodness, when I was wandering about in the shape of a black crow, freed from the most awful torments", ' Come now to my castle with me, and let us live there happily together', "' So they went to the castle where they had both endured so much", ' But when they reached it, it was difficult to believe that it was the same, for it had all been rebuilt and done up again  Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond  Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish  And a crane thought on seeing the fish: "I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them " And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he should do it  When the fish saw him, they asked him, "What are you sitting there for, lost in thought?" "I am sitting thinking about you," said he  "Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?" said they  "Why," he replied; "there is very little water in this pond, and but little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking, \'What in the world will these fish do now?\'" "Yes, indeed, sir! what _are_ we to do?" said they  "If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you into it," answered the crane  "That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of, sir, since the world began', " It's eating us, one after the other, that you're aiming at", '" "Not I! So long as you trust me, I won\'t eat you', " But if you don't believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and see it", '" Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number--a big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any emergency, afloat or ashore  Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other fish  And he told them all the glories of the pond  And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, "All right, sir! You may take us with you " Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there  But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree  Then he went back and called out: "I\'ve thrown that fish in; let another one come " And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till he came back and found no more! But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he would eat him too, and called out: "I say, good crab, I\'ve taken all the fish away, and put them into a fine large pond  Come along  I\'ll take you too!" "But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?" "I\'ll bite hold of you with my beak " "You\'ll let me fall if you carry me like that  I won\'t go with you!" "Don\'t be afraid! I\'ll hold you quite tight all the way " Then said the crab to himself, "If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn\'t--then I\'ll cut his throat, and kill him!" So he said to him: "Look here, friend, you won\'t be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip  If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you " And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed  So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith\'s pincers, and called out, "Off with you, now!" And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree  "Uncle!" cried the crab, "the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!" "Oh, that\'s it, is it?" answered the crane  "Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree  In a very cold country, far across the seas, where ice and snow cover the ground for many months in the year, there lived a little hare, who, as his father and mother were both dead, was brought up by his grandmother  As he was too young, and she was too old, to work, they were very poor, and often did not have enough to eat  One day, when the little fellow was hungrier than usual, he asked his grandmother if he might go down to the river and catch a fish for their breakfast, as the thaw had come and the water was flowing freely again  She laughed at him for thinking that any fish would let itself be caught by a hare, especially such a young one; but as she had the rheumatism very badly, and could get no food herself, she let him go', " 'If he does not catch a fish he may find something else,' she said to herself", ' So she told her grandson where to look for the net, and how he was to set it across the river; but just as he was starting, feeling himself quite a man, she called him back', " 'After all, I don't know what is the use of your going, my boy! For even if you should catch a fish, I have no fire to cook it with", "' 'Let me catch my fish, and I will soon make you a fire,' he answered gaily, for he was young, and knew nothing about the difficulties of fire-making", ' It took him some time to haul the net through bushes and over fields, but at length he reached a pool in the river which he had often heard was swarming with fish, and here he set the net, as his grandmother had directed him  He was so excited that he hardly slept all night, and at the very first streak of dawn he ran as fast as ever he could down to the river  His heart beat as quickly as if he had had dogs behind him, and he hardly dared to look, lest he should be disappointed  Would there be even one fish? And at this thought the pangs of hunger made him feel quite sick with fear  But he need not have been afraid; in every mesh of the net was a fine fat fish, and of course the net itself was so heavy that he could only lift one corner  He threw some of the fish back into the water, and buried some more in a hole under a stone, where he would be sure to find them  Then he rolled up the net with the rest, put it on his back and carried it home  The weight of the load caused his back to ache, and he was thankful to drop it outside their hut, while he rushed in, full of joy, to tell his grandmother', " 'Be quick and clean them!' he said, 'and I will go to those people's tents on the other side of the water", "' The old woman stared at him in horror as she listened to his proposal", ' Other people had tried to steal fire before, and few indeed had come back with their lives; but as, contrary to all her expectations, he had managed to catch such a number of fish, she thought that perhaps there was some magic about him which she did not know of, and did not try to hinder him  When the fish were all taken out, he fetched the net which he had laid out to dry, folded it up very small, and ran down to the river, hoping that he might find a place narrow enough for him to jump over; but he soon saw that it was too wide for even the best jumper in the world  For a few moments he stood there, wondering what was to be done, then there darted into his head some words of a spell which he had once heard a wizard use, while drinking from the river  He repeated them, as well as he could remember, and waited to see what would happen  In five minutes such a grunting and a puffing was heard, and columns of water rose into the air, though he could not tell what had made them  Then round the bend of the stream came fifteen huge whales, which he ordered to place themselves heads to tails, like stepping stones, so that he could jump from one to the other till he landed on the opposite shore  Directly he got there he told the whales that he did not need them any more, and sat down in the sand to rest  Unluckily some children who were playing about caught sight of him, and one of them, stealing softly up behind him, laid tight hold of his ears  The hare, who had been watching the whales as they sailed down the river, gave a violent start, and struggled to get away; but the boy held on tight, and ran back home, as fast as he could go', " 'Throw it in the pot,' said the old woman, as soon as he had told his story; 'put it in that basket, and as soon as the water boils in the pot we will hang it over the fire!' 'Better kill it first,' said the old man; and the hare listened, horribly frightened, but still looking secretly to see if there was no hole through which he could escape, if he had a chance of doing so", ' Yes, there was one, right in the top of the tent, so, shaking himself, as if with fright, he let the end of his net unroll itself a little', " 'I wish that a spark of fire would fall on my net,' whispered he; and the next minute a great log fell forward into the midst of the tent, causing every one to spring backwards" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a shoemaker who could get no work to do, and was so poor that he and his wife nearly died of hunger', " At last he said to her, 'It is no use waiting on here--I can find nothing; so I shall go down to Mascalucia, and perhaps there I shall be more lucky", "' So down he went to Mascalucia, and walked through the streets crying, 'Who wants some shoes?' And very soon a window was pushed up, and a woman's head was thrust out of it", " 'Here are a pair for you to patch,' she said", ' And he sat down on her doorstep and set about patching them', " 'How much do I owe you?' she asked when they were done", " 'A shilling", "' 'Here is eighteen pence, and good luck to you", "' And he went his way", ' He turned into the next street and set up his cry again, and it was not long before another window was pushed up and another head appeared', " 'Here are some shoes for you to patch", "' And the shoemaker sat down on the doorstep and patched them", " 'How much do I owe you?' asked the woman when the shoes were finished", " 'A florin", "' 'Here is a crown piece, and good luck to you", "' And she shut the window", " 'Well,' thought the shoemaker, 'I have done finely", ' But I will not go back to my wife just yet, as, if I only go on at this rate, I shall soon have enough money to buy a donkey', "' Having made up his mind what was best to do, he stayed in the town a few days longer till he had four gold pieces safe in his purse", ' Then he went to the market and for two of them he bought a good strong donkey, and, mounting on its back, he rode home to Catania  But as he entered a thick wood he saw in the distance a band of robbers who were coming quickly towards him', " 'I am lost,' thought he; 'they are sure to take from me all the money that I have earned, and I shall be as poor as ever I was", " What can I do?' However, being a clever little man and full of spirit, he did not lose heart, but, taking five florins, he fastened them out of sight under the donkey's thick mane", ' Then he rode on  Directly the robber came up to him they seized him exactly as he had foretold and took away all his money', " 'Oh, dear friends!' he cried, wringing his hands, 'I am only a poor shoemaker, and have nothing but this donkey left in the world", "' As he spoke the donkey gave himself a shake, and down fell the five florins", " 'Where did that come from?' asked the robbers", " 'Ah,' replied the shoemaker, 'you have guessed my secret", ' The donkey is a golden donkey, and supplies me with all my money  Once upon a time there were a man and his wife who lived in the forest, very far from the rest of the tribe  Very often they spent the day in hunting together, but after a while the wife found that she had so many things to do that she was obliged to stay at home; so he went alone, though he found that when his wife was not with him he never had any luck  One day, when he was away hunting, the woman fell ill, and in a few days she died  Her husband grieved bitterly, and buried her in the house where she had passed her life; but as the time went on he felt so lonely without her that he made a wooden doll about her height and size for company, and dressed it in her clothes  He seated it in front of the fire, and tried to think he had his wife back again  The next day he went out to hunt, and when he came home the first thing he did was to go up to the doll and brush off some of the ashes from the fire which had fallen on its face  But he was very busy now, for he had to cook and mend, besides getting food, for there was no one to help him  And so a whole year passed away  At the end of that time he came back from hunting one night and found some wood by the door and a fire within  The next night there was not only wood and fire, but a piece of meat in the kettle, nearly ready for eating  He searched all about to see who could have done this, but could find no one  The next time he went to hunt he took care not to go far, and came in quite early  And while he was still a long way off he saw a woman going into the house with wood on her shoulders  So he made haste, and opened the door quickly, and instead of the wooden doll, his wife sat in front of the fire', " Then she spoke to him and said, 'The Great Spirit felt sorry for you, because you would not be comforted, so he let me come back to you, but you must not stretch out your hand to touch me till we have seen the rest of our people", ' If you do, I shall die', "' So the man listened to her words, and the woman dwelt there, and brought the wood and kindled the fire, till one day her husband said to her, 'It is now two years since you died", ' Let us now go back to our tribe  Then you will be well, and I can touch you', "' And with that he prepared food for the journey, a string of deer's flesh for her to carry, and one for himself; and so they started", " Now the camp of the tribe was distant six days' journey, and when they were yet one day's journey off it began to snow, and they felt weary and longed for rest", ' Therefore they made a fire, cooked some food, and spread out their skins to sleep', " Then the heart of the man was greatly stirred, and he stretched out his arms to his wife, but she waved her hands and said, 'We have seen no one yet; it is too soon", "' But he would not listen to her, and caught her to him, and behold!

I am afraid to go back to the Sultan, for he will command his servants to turn me from the door", ' But you shall return to your mistress, and throw yourself at her feet and weep, and perhaps she will help us', "' 'Oh, you had much better go,' said the wife", " 'I shall not know what to say", "' 'Well, then, stay at home, if you like,' answered Abu Nowas, 'and I will ask to be admitted to the Sultan's presence, and will tell him, with sobs, that my wife is dead, and that I have no money for her burial", ' When he hears that perhaps he will give us something', "' 'Yes, that is a good plan,' said the wife; and Abu Nowas set out", ' The Sultan was sitting in the hall of justice when Abu Nowas entered, his eyes streaming with tears, for he had rubbed some pepper into them  They smarted dreadfully, and he could hardly see to walk straight, and everyone wondered what was the matter with him', " 'Abu Nowas! What has happened?' cried the Sultan", " 'Oh, noble Sultan, my wife is dead,' wept he", " 'We must all die,' answered the Sultan; but this was not the reply for which Abu Nowas had hoped", " 'True, O Sultan, but I have neither shroud to wrap her in, nor money to bury her with,' went on Abu Nowas, in no wise abashed by the way the Sultan had received his news", " 'Well, give him a hundred pieces of gold,' said the Sultan, turning to the Grand Vizir", ' And when the money was counted out Abu Nowas bowed low, and left the hall, his tears still flowing, but with joy in his heart', " 'Have you got anything?' cried his wife, who was waiting for him anxiously" ,  ' IN a certain kingdom there lived a Prince Ivan  He had three sisters  The first was the Princess Marya, the second the Princess Olga, the third the Princess Anna', " When their father and mother lay at the point of death, they had thus enjoined their son: 'Give your sisters in marriage to the very first suitors who come to woo them", " Don't go keeping them by you!'

Before you can do that, you have a difficult task before you", ' You must guard the tree for nine days and nine nights from the ravages of two wild black wolves, who will try to harm it', " Do you think you can undertake this?' 'Yes,' answered the Sun-Hero, 'I will guard the Tree of the Sun nine days and nine nights", "' Then the girl continued: 'Remember, though, if you do not succeed the Sun will kill you", ' Now begin your watch', "' With these words the Red Girl went back into the golden castle", ' She had hardly left him when the two black wolves appeared: but the Sun-Hero beat them off with his sword, and they retired, only, however, to reappear in a very short time  The Sun-Hero chased them away once more, but he had hardly sat down to rest when the two black wolves were on the scene again', " This went on for seven days and nights, when the white horse, who had never done such a thing before, turned to the Sun-Hero and said in a human voice: 'Listen to what I am going to say", ' A Fairy gave me to your mother in order that I might be of service to you; so let me tell you, that if you go to sleep and let the wolves harm the tree, the Sun will surely kill you', " The Fairy, foreseeing this, put everyone in the world under a spell, which prevents their obeying the Sun's command to take your life", ' But all the same, she has forgotten one person, who will certainly kill you if you fall asleep and let the wolves damage the tree  So watch and keep the wolves away', "' Then the Sun-Hero strove with all his might and kept the black wolves at bay, and conquered his desire to sleep; but on the eighth night his strength failed him, and he fell fast asleep", " When he awoke a woman in black stood beside him, who said: 'You have fulfilled your task very badly, for you have let the two black wolves damage the Tree of the Sun" ,  ' There was a woman in Connemara, the wife of a fisherman; as he had always good luck, she had plenty of fish at all times stored away in the house ready for market  But, to her great annoyance, she found that a great cat used to come in at night and devour all the best and finest fish  So she kept a big stick by her, and determined to watch  One day, as she and a woman were spinning together, the house suddenly became quite dark; and the door was burst open as if by the blast of the tempest, when in walked a huge black cat, who went straight up to the fire, then turned round and growled at them  "Why, surely this is the devil," said a young girl who was by, sorting fish  "I\'ll teach you to call me names," said the cat; and, jumping at her, he scratched her arm till the blood came  "There, now," he said, "you will be more civil another time when a gentleman comes to see you " And, with that, he walked over to the door, and shut it close to prevent any of them going out, for the poor young girl, while crying loudly from fright and pain, had made a desperate rush to get away  Just then a man was going by, and, hearing the cries, he pushed open the door, and tried to get in; but the cat stood on the threshold and would let no one pass  On this the man attacked him with a stick, and gave him a sound blow; the cat, however, was more than a match in the fight, for it flew at him, and tore his face and hands so badly that the man at last took to his heels, and ran away as fast as he could  "Now, it\'s time for my dinner," said the cat, going up to examine the fish that was laid out on the tables  "I hope the fish is good to-day', " Now, don't disturb me, or make a fuss; I can help myself", '" With that, he jumped up, and began to devour all the best fish, while he growled at the woman  "Away out of this, you wicked beast!" she cried, giving it a blow with the tongs that would have broken its back, only it was a devil; "out of this; no fish shall you have to-day!" But the cat only grinned at her, and went on tearing and despoiling and devouring the fish, evidently not a bit the worse for the blows  On this both the women attacked it with sticks, and struck hard blows enough to kill it, on which the cat glared at them and spit fire; then, making a leap, it tore their heads and arms till the blood came, and the frightened women rushed shrieking from the house  But presently the mistress of the house returned, carrying with her a bottle of holy water; and, looking in, she saw the cat still devouring the fish, and not minding  So she crept over quietly, and threw holy water on it without a word  No sooner was this done than a dense, black smoke filled the place, through which nothing was seen but the two red eyes of the cat burning like coals of fire  Then the smoke gradually cleared away, and she saw the body of the creature burning slowly, till it became shrivelled and black like a cinder, and finally disappeared  And from that time the fish remained untouched and safe from harm, for the power of the Evil One was broken, and the Demon Cat was seen no more     _This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a Brother who had ceased striving after righteousness  Said the Teacher to him: "Is it really true that you have ceased all striving?"--"Yes, Blessed One," he replied  Then the Teacher said: "O Brother, in former days wise men made effort in the place where effort should be made, and so attained unto royal power " And he told a story of long ago _ Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was King of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as son of his chief queen  On his name-day they asked 800 Brahmans, having satisfied them with all their desires, about his lucky marks  The Brahmans who had skill in divining from such marks beheld the excellence of his, and made answer: "Full of goodness, great King, is your son, and when you die he will become king; he shall be famous and renowned for his skill with the five weapons, and shall be the chief man in all India " On hearing what the Brahmans had to say, they gave him the name of the Prince of the Five Weapons, sword, spear, bow, battle-axe, and shield  When he came to years of discretion, and had attained the measure of sixteen years, the King said to him: "My son, go and complete your education " "Who shall be my teacher?" the lad asked  "Go, my son; in the kingdom of Candahar, in the city of Takkasila, is a far-famed teacher from whom I wish you to learn  Take this, and give it him for a fee " With that he gave him a thousand pieces of money, and dismissed him  The lad departed, and was educated by this teacher; he received the Five Weapons from him as a gift, bade him farewell, and leaving Takkasila, he began his journey to Benares, armed with the Five Weapons  On his way he came to a forest inhabited by the Demon with the Matted Hair  At the entering in of the forest some men saw him, and cried out: "Hullo, young sir, keep clear of that wood! There\'s a Demon in it called he of the Matted Hair: he kills every man he sees!" And they tried to stop him  But the Bodhisatta, having confidence in himself, went straight on, fearless as a maned lion  When he reached mid-forest the Demon showed himself  He made himself as tall as a palm tree; his head was the size of a pagoda, his eyes as big as saucers, and he had two tusks all over knobs and bulbs; he had the face of a hawk, a variegated belly, and blue hands and feet  "Where are you going?" he shouted  "Stop! You\'ll make a meal for me!" Said the Bodhisatta: "Demon, I came here trusting in myself  I advise you to be careful how you come near me  Here\'s a poisoned arrow, which I\'ll shoot at you and knock you down!" With this menace, he fitted to his bow an arrow dipped in deadly poison, and let fly', " The arrow stuck fast in the Demon's hair", " Then he shot and shot, till he had shot away fifty arrows; and they all stuck in the Demon's hair", ' The Demon snapped them all off short, and threw them down at his feet; then came up to the Bodhisatta, who drew his sword and struck the Demon, threatening him the while', " His sword--it was three-and-thirty inches long--stuck in the Demon's hair! The Bodhisatta struck him with his spear--that stuck too! He struck him with his club--and that stuck too! When the Bodhisatta saw that this had stuck fast, he addressed the Demon", ' "You, Demon!" said he, "did you never hear of me before--the Prince of the Five Weapons? When I came into the forest which you live in I did not trust to my bow and other weapons  This day will I pound you and grind you to powder!" Thus did he declare his resolve, and with a shout he hit at the Demon with his right hand  It stuck fast in his hair! He hit him with his left hand--that stuck too! With his right foot he kicked him--that stuck too; then with his left--and that stuck too! Then he butted at him with his head, crying, "I\'ll pound you to powder!" and his head stuck fast like the rest  ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole  He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber  The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water  "You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads," she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done  But the little ducks paid no attention to her  They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all  "What disobedient children!" cried the old Water-rat; "they really deserve to be drowned " "Nothing of the kind," answered the Duck, "every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient " "Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents," said the Water-rat; "I am not a family man  In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship " "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?" asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation  "Yes, that is just what I want to know," said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example  "What a silly question!" cried the Water-rat  "I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course " "And what would you do in return?" said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings  "I don\'t understand you," answered the Water-rat  "Let me tell you a story on the subject," said the Linnet  "Is the story about me?" asked the Water-rat  "If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction " "It is applicable to you," answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend  "Once upon a time," said the Linnet, "there was an honest little fellow named Hans " "Was he very distinguished?" asked the Water-rat  "No," answered the Linnet, "I don\'t think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face  He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his', " Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France", ' There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white', " Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell" ,  ' There was once a young Hunter who went boldly into the forest', " He had a merry and light heart, and as he went whistling along there came an ugly old woman, who said to him, 'Good-day, dear hunter! You are very merry and contented, but I suffer hunger and thirst, so give me a trifle", "' The Hunter was sorry for the poor old woman, and he felt in his pocket and gave her all he could spare", " He was going on then, but the old woman stopped him and said, 'Listen, dear hunter, to what I say", ' Because of your kind heart I will make you a present  Go on your way, and in a short time you will come to a tree on which sit nine birds who have a cloak in their claws and are quarrelling over it  Then take aim with your gun and shoot in the middle of them; they will let the cloak fall, but one of the birds will be hit and will drop down dead  Take the cloak with you; it is a wishing-cloak, and when you throw it on your shoulders you have only to wish yourself at a certain place, and in the twinkling of an eye you are there  Take the heart out of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and early every morning when you get up you will find a gold piece under your pillow', "' The Hunter thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself 'These are splendid things she has promised me, if only they come to pass!' So he walked on about a hundred yards, and then he heard above him in the branches such a screaming and chirping that he looked up, and there he saw a heap of birds tearing a cloth with their beaks and feet, shrieking, tugging, and fighting, as if each wanted it for himself", " 'Well,' said the Hunter, 'this is wonderful! It is just as the old woman said'; and he took his gun on his shoulder, pulled the trigger, and shot into the midst of them, so that their feathers flew about", ' Then the flock took flight with much screaming, but one fell dead, and the cloak fluttered down  Then the Hunter did as the old woman had told him: he cut open the bird, found its heart, swallowed it, and took the cloak home with him  The next morning when he awoke he remembered the promise, and wanted to see if it had come true  But when he lifted up his pillow, there sparkled the gold piece, and the next morning he found another, and so on every time he got up', " He collected a heap of gold, but at last he thought to himself, 'What good is all my gold to me if I stay at home? I will travel and look a bit about me in the world", "' So he took leave of his parents, slung his hunting knapsack and his gun round him, and journeyed into the world", ' It happened that one day he went through a thick wood, and when he came to the end of it there lay in the plain before him a large castle  At one of the windows in it stood an old woman with a most beautiful maiden by her side, looking out', " But the old woman was a witch, and she said to the girl, 'There comes one out of the wood who has a wonderful treasure in his body which we must manage to possess ourselves of, darling daughter; we have more right to it than he", " He has a bird's heart in him, and so every morning there lies a gold piece under his pillow", "' She told her how they could get hold of it, and how she was to coax it from him, and at last threatened her angrily, saying, 'And if you do not obey me, you shall repent it!' When the Hunter came nearer he saw the maiden, and said to himself, 'I have travelled so far now that I will rest, and turn into this beautiful castle; money I have in plenty", "' But the real reason was that he had caught sight of the lovely face", ' He went into the house, and was kindly received and hospitably entertained  It was not long before he was so much in love with the witch-maiden that he thought of nothing else, and only looked in her eyes, and whatever she wanted, that he gladly did', " Then the old witch said, 'Now we must have the bird-heart; he will not feel when it is gone", "' She prepared a drink, and when it was ready she poured it in a goblet and gave it to the maiden, who had to hand it to the hunter", " 'Drink to me now, my dearest,' she said", ' Then he took the goblet, and when he had swallowed the drink the bird-heart came out of his mouth  The maiden had to get hold of it secretly and then swallow it herself, for the old witch wanted to have it  There was once a great war, and the King had a great many soldiers, but he gave them so little pay that they could not live upon it  Then three of them took counsel together and determined to desert', " One of them said to the others, 'If we are caught, we shall be hanged on the gallows; how shall we set about it?' The other said, 'Do you see that large cornfield there? If we were to hide ourselves in that, no one could find us", ' The army cannot come into it, and to-morrow it is to march on', "' They crept into the corn, but the army did not march on, but remained encamped close around them", ' They sat for two days and two nights in the corn, and grew so hungry that they nearly died; but if they were to venture out, it was certain death', " They said at last, 'What use was it our deserting? We must perish here miserably", "' Whilst they were speaking a fiery dragon came flying through the air", ' It hovered near them, and asked why they were hidden there', " They answered, 'We are three soldiers, and have deserted because our pay was so small", ' Now if we remain here we shall die of hunger, and if we move out we shall be strung up on the gallows', "' 'If you will serve me for seven years,' said the dragon, I will lead you through the midst of the army so that no one shall catch you", "' 'We have no choice, and must take your offer,' said they", ' Then the dragon seized them in his claws, took them through the air over the army, and set them down on the earth a long way from it', " He gave them a little whip, saying, 'Whip and slash with this, and as much money as you want will jump up before you", ' You can then live as great lords, keep horses, and drive about in carriages  But after seven years you are mine', "' Then he put a book before them, which he made all three of them sign", " 'I will then give you a riddle,' he said; 'if you guess it, you shall be free and out of my power", "' The dragon then flew away, and they journeyed on with their little whip", ' They had as much money as they wanted, wore grand clothes, and made their way into the world  Wherever they went they lived in merrymaking and splendour, drove about with horses and carriages, ate and drank, but did nothing wrong', " The time passed quickly away, and when the seven years were nearly ended two of them grew terribly anxious and frightened, but the third made light of it, saying, 'Don't be afraid, brothers, I wasn't born yesterday; I will guess the riddle", "' They went into a field, sat down, and the two pulled long faces", ' An old woman passed by, and asked them why they were so sad', " 'Alas! what have you to do with it? You cannot help us", "' 'Who knows?' she answered", " 'Only confide your trouble in me", "' Then they told her that they had become the servants of the Dragon for seven long years, and how he had given them money as plentifully as blackberries; but as they had signed their names they were his, unless when the seven years had passed they could guess a riddle", " The old woman said, 'If you would help yourselves, one of you must go into the wood, and there he will come upon a tumble-down building of rocks which looks like a little house" ,  ' Very long ago, as old people have told me, there lived a terrible monster, who came out of the North, and laid waste whole tracts of country, devouring both men and beasts; and this monster was so destructive that it was feared that unless help came no living creature would be left on the face of the earth  It had a body like an ox, and legs like a frog, two short fore-legs, and two long ones behind, and besides that it had a tail like a serpent, ten fathoms in length  When it moved it jumped like a frog, and with every spring it covered half a mile of ground  Fortunately its habit, was to remain for several years in the same place, and not to move on till the whole neighbourhood was eaten up', " Nothing could hunt it, because its whole body was covered with scales, which were harder than stone or metal; its two great eyes shone by night, and even by day, like the brightest lamps, and anyone who had the ill luck to look into those eyes became as it were bewitched, and was obliged to rush of his own accord into the monster's jaws", ' In this way the Dragon was able to feed upon both men and beasts without the least trouble to itself, as it needed not to move from the spot where it was lying  All the neighbouring kings had offered rich rewards to anyone who should be able to destroy the monster, either by force or enchantment, and many had tried their luck, but all had miserably failed  Once a great forest in which the Dragon lay had been set on fire; the forest was burnt down, but the fire did not do the monster the least harm', " However, there was a tradition amongst the wise men of the country that the Dragon might be overcome by one who possessed King Solomon's signet-ring, upon which a secret writing was engraved", ' This inscription would enable anyone who was wise enough to interpret it to find out how the Dragon could be destroyed  Only no one knew where the ring was hidden, nor was there any sorcerer or learned man to be found who would be able to explain the inscription  At last a young man, with a good heart and plenty of courage, set out to search for the ring  He took his way towards the sunrising, because he knew that all the wisdom of old time comes from the East  After some years he met with a famous Eastern magician, and asked for his advice in the matter', " The magician answered: 'Mortal men have but little wisdom, and can give you no help, but the birds of the air would be better guides to you if you could learn their language", ' I can help you to understand it if you will stay with me a few days', "' The youth thankfully accepted the magician's offer, and said, 'I cannot now offer you any reward for your kindness, but should my undertaking succeed your trouble shall be richly repaid", "' Then the magician brewed a powerful potion out of nine sorts of herbs which he had gathered himself all alone by moonlight, and he gave the youth nine spoonfuls of it daily for three days, which made him able to understand the language of birds", ' At parting the magician said to him', " 'If you ever find Solomon's ring and get possession of it, then come back to me, that I may explain the inscription on the ring to you, for there is no one else in the world who can do this", "' From that time the youth never felt lonely as he walked along; he always had company, because he understood the language of birds; and in this way he learned many things which mere human knowledge could never have taught him", ' But time went on, and he heard nothing about the ring  It happened one evening, when he was hot and tired with walking, and had sat down under a tree in a forest to eat his supper, that he saw two gaily-plumaged birds, that were strange to him, sitting at the top of the tree talking to one another about him', " The first bird said: 'I know that wandering fool under the tree there, who has come so far without finding what he seeks", " He is trying to find King Solomon's lost ring", "' The other bird answered, 'He will have to seek help from the Witch-maiden,(3) who will doubtless be able to put him on the right track", ' If she has not got the ring herself, she knows well enough who has it', "' (3) Hollenmadchen", " 'But where is he to find the Witch-maiden?' said the first bird", " 'She has no settled dwelling, but is here to-day and gone to-morrow" ,  ' Ah! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for Charles, and it is all well enough if one does but know it  He had now to take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much younger than himself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but these two things would not do together at all  There sat the poor little fellow, with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he knew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book that lay open before him  By the next morning he was to have learnt all the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is possible to be known  His mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta on her arm  Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he pretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his mother had no money to buy a candle  "There goes the old washerwoman over the way," said his mother, as she looked out of the window  "The poor woman can hardly drag herself along, and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain  Be a good boy, Tukey, and run across and help the old woman, won\'t you?" So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into the room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of such a thing  He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead; in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and of all that his master had told him  He ought, to be sure, to have read over his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do', " He therefore put his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one cannot, however, rely upon it entirely", ' Well, there he lay, and thought and thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes and mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, "It were a great sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning  You have aided me, I therefore will now help you; and the loving God will do so at all times " And all of a sudden the book under Tuk\'s pillow began scraping and scratching  "Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!"--that was an old hen who came creeping along, and she was from Kjoge  "I am a Kjoger hen," said she, and then she related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the battle that had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth talking about     Kjoge, a town in the bay of Kjoge  "To see the Kjoge   hens," is an expression similar to "showing a child London,"    which is said to be done by taking his head in both bands,   and so lifting him off the ground  At the invasion of the   English in 1807, an encounter of a no very glorious nature   took place between the British troops and the undisciplined   Danish militia  "Kribledy, krabledy--plump!" down fell somebody: it was a wooden bird, the popinjay used at the shooting-matches at Prastoe  Now he said that there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body; and he was very proud  "Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me  Plump! Here I lie capitally " Prastoe, a still smaller town than Kjoge  Some hundred paces from it lies the manor-house Ny Soe, where Thorwaldsen, the famed sculptor, generally sojourned during his stay in Denmark, and where he called many of his immortal works into existence  But little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on horseback  On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on  A knight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him before him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old town of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town  High towers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of many candles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song, and King Waldemar and the young, richly-attired maids of honor danced together  In all Fairyland there is no more mischievous a person than Tanko-Mankie the Yellow Ryl  He flew through the city one afternoon--quite invisible to moral eyes, but seeing everything himself--and noticed a figure of a wax lady standing behind the big plate glass window of Mr', " Floman's department store", ' The wax lady was beautifully dressed, and extended in her stiff left hand was a card bearing the words:   "RARE BARGIN!   This Stylish Costume   (Imported from Paris)   Former Price, 20,   REDUCED TO ONLY 19 98 " This impressive announcement had drawn before the window a crowd of women shoppers, who stood looking at the wax lady with critical eyes  Tanko-Mankie laughed to himself the low, gurgling little laugh that always means mischief  Then he flew close to the wax figure and breathed twice upon its forehead  From that instant the dummy began to live, but so dazed and astonished was she at the unexpected sensation that she continued to stand stupidly staring at the women outside and holding out the placard as before  The ryl laughed again and flew away  Anyone but Tanko-Mankie would have remained to help the wax lady out of the troubles that were sure to overtake her; but this naughty elf thought it rare fun to turn the inexperienced lady loose in a cold and heartless world and leave her to shift for herself', " Fortunately it was almost six o'clock when the dummy first realized that she was alive, and before she had collected her new thoughts and decided what to do a man came around and drew down all the window shades, shutting off the view from the curious shoppers", ' Then the clerks and cashiers and floorwalkers and cash girls went home and the store was closed for the night, although the sweepers and scrubbers remained to clean the floors for the following day  The window inhabited by the wax lady was boxed in, like a little room, one small door being left at the side for the window-trimmer to creep in and out of  So the scrubbers never noticed that the dummy, when left to herself, dropped the placard to the floor and sat down upon a pile of silks to wonder who she was, where she was, and how she happened to be alive  For you must consider, dear reader, that in spite of her size and her rich costume, in spite of her pink cheeks and fluffy yellow hair, this lady was very young--no older, in reality, than a baby born but half an hour  All she knew of the world was contained in the glimpse she had secured of the busy street facing her window; all she knew of people lay in the actions of the group of women which had stood before her on the other side of the window pane and criticised the fit of her dress or remarked upon its stylish appearance  So she had little enough to think about, and her thoughts moved somewhat slowly; yet one thing she really decided upon, and that was not to remain in the window and be insolently stared at by a lot of women who were not nearly so handsome or well dressed as herself  By the time she reached this important conclusion, it was after midnight; but dim lights were burning in the big, deserted store, so she crept through the door of her window and walked down the long aisles, pausing now and then to look with much curiosity at the wealth of finery confronting her on every side  When she came to the glass cases filled with trimmed hats she remembered having seen upon the heads of the women in the street similar creations  So she selected one that suited her fancy and placed it carefully upon her yellow locks', " I won't attempt to explain what instinct it was that made her glance into a near-by mirror to see if the hat was straight, but this she certainly did", " It didn't correspond with her dress very well, but the poor thing was too young to have much taste in matching colors", ' When she reached the glove counter she remembered that gloves were also worn by the women she had seen  She took a pair from the case and tried to fit them upon her stiff, wax-coated fingers; but the gloves were too small and ripped in the seams  Then she tried another pair, and several others, as well; but hours passed before she finally succeeded in getting her hands covered with a pair of pea-green kids  Next she selected a parasol from a large and varied assortment in the rear of the store  Not that she had any idea what it was used for; but other ladies carried such things, so she also would have one  When she again examined herself critically in the mirror she decided her outfit was now complete, and to her inexperienced eyes there was no perceptible difference between her and the women who had stood outside the window  Whereupon she tried to leave the store, but found every door fast locked  Once upon a time there was a little boy who had taken cold  He had gone out and got his feet wet; though nobody could imagine how it had happened, for it was quite dry weather  So his mother undressed him, put him to bed, and had the tea-pot brought in, to make him a good cup of Elderflower tea  Just at that moment the merry old man came in who lived up a-top of the house all alone; for he had neither wife nor children--but he liked children very much, and knew so many fairy tales, that it was quite delightful  "Now drink your tea," said the boy\'s mother; "then, perhaps, you may hear a fairy tale " "If I had but something new to tell," said the old man  "But how did the child get his feet wet?" "That is the very thing that nobody can make out," said his mother  "Am I to hear a fairy tale?" asked the little boy  "Yes, if you can tell me exactly--for I must know that first--how deep the gutter is in the little street opposite, that you pass through in going to school " "Just up to the middle of my boot," said the child; "but then I must go into the deep hole " "Ah, ah! That\'s where the wet feet came from," said the old man  "I ought now to tell you a story; but I don\'t know any more " "You can make one in a moment," said the little boy  "My mother says that all you look at can be turned into a fairy tale: and that you can find a story in everything " "Yes, but such tales and stories are good for nothing', " The right sort come of themselves; they tap at my forehead and say, 'Here we are", '\'" "Won\'t there be a tap soon?" asked the little boy  And his mother laughed, put some Elder-flowers in the tea-pot, and poured boiling water upon them  "Do tell me something! Pray do!" "Yes, if a fairy tale would come of its own accord; but they are proud and haughty, and come only when they choose  Stop!" said he, all on a sudden  "I have it! Pay attention! There is one in the tea-pot!" And the little boy looked at the tea-pot  The cover rose more and more; and the Elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white, and shot up long branches  Out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides, and grew larger and larger; it was a splendid Elderbush, a whole tree; and it reached into the very bed, and pushed the curtains aside  How it bloomed! And what an odour! In the middle of the bush sat a friendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress  It was quite green, like the leaves of the elder, and was trimmed with large white Elder-flowers; so that at first one could not tell whether it was a stuff, or a natural green and real flowers  "What\'s that woman\'s name?" asked the little boy  "The Greeks and Romans," said the old man, "called her a Dryad; but that we do not understand', " The people who live in the New Booths have a much better name for her; they call her 'old Granny'--and she it is to whom you are to pay attention", ' Now listen, and look at the beautiful Elderbush     A row of buildings for seamen in Copenhagen  Once upon a time two young men living in a small village fell in love with the same girl  During the winter, it was all night except for an hour or so about noon, when the darkness seemed a little less dark, and then they used to see which of them could tempt her out for a sleigh ride with the Northern Lights flashing above them, or which could persuade her to come to a dance in some neighbouring barn  But when the spring began, and the light grew longer, the hearts of the villagers leapt at the sight of the sun, and a day was fixed for the boats to be brought out, and the great nets to be spread in the bays of some islands that lay a few miles to the north  Everybody went on this expedition, and the two young men and the girl went with them  They all sailed merrily across the sea chattering like a flock of magpies, or singing their favourite songs  And when they reached the shore, what an unpacking there was! For this was a noted fishing ground, and here they would live, in little wooden huts, till autumn and bad weather came round again  The maiden and the two young men happened to share the same hut with some friends, and fished daily from the same boat  And as time went on, one of the youths remarked that the girl took less notice of him than she did of his companion  At first he tried to think that he was dreaming, and for a long while he kept his eyes shut very tight to what he did not want to see, but in spite of his efforts, the truth managed to wriggle through, and then the young man gave up trying to deceive himself, and set about finding some way to get the better of his rival  The plan that he hit upon could not be carried out for some months; but the longer the young man thought of it, the more pleased he was with it, so he made no sign of his feelings, and waited patiently till the moment came  This was the very day that they were all going to leave the islands, and sail back to the mainland for the winter', " In the bustle and hurry of departure, the cunning fisherman contrived that their boat should be the last to put off, and when everything was ready, and the sails about to be set, he suddenly called out: 'Oh, dear, what shall I do! I have left my best knife behind in the hut", ' Run, like a good fellow, and get it for me, while I raise the anchor and loosen the tiller', "' Not thinking any harm, the youth jumped back on shore and made his way up the steep hank", ' At the door of the hut he stopped and looked back, then started and gazed in horror  The head of the boat stood out to sea, and he was left alone on the island  Yes, there was no doubt of it--he was quite alone; and he had nothing to help him except the knife which his comrade had purposely dropped on the ledge of the window  For some minutes he was too stunned by the treachery of his friend to think about anything at all, but after a while he shook himself awake, and determined that he would manage to keep alive somehow, if it were only to revenge himself  So he put the knife in his pocket and went off to a part of the island which was not so bare as the rest, and had a small grove of trees  From one of these he cut himself a bow, which he strung with a piece of cord that had been left lying about the huts  When this was ready the young man ran down to the shore and shot one or two sea-birds, which he plucked and cooked for supper  In this way the months slipped by, and Christmas came round again  The evening before, the youth went down to the rocks and into the copse, collecting all the drift wood the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down, and he piled it up in a great stack outside the door, so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day  As soon as his task was done, he paused and looked out towards the mainland, thinking of Christmas Eve last year, and the merry dance they had had  The night was still and cold, and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast, when, suddenly, he noticed a boat, which seemed steering straight for the island  At first he could hardly stand for joy, the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful; but as the boat drew near there was something, he could not tell what, that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life, and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours  Then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack, and waited for what might happen next  The strange folk one by one jumped on to the rocks, each bearing a load of something that they wanted  Among the women he remarked two young girls, more beautiful and better dressed than any of the rest, carrying between them two great baskets full of provisions  The young man peeped out cautiously to see what all this crowd could be doing inside the tiny hut, but in a moment he drew back again, as the girls returned, and looked about as if they wanted to find out what sort of a place the island was  ONCE upon a time, in the reign of King Cambrinus, there lived at Avesnes one of his lords, who was the finest man--by which I mean the fattest--in the whole country of Flanders  He ate four meals a day, slept twelve hours out of the twenty-four, and the only thing he ever did was to shoot at small birds with his bow and arrow  Still, with all his practice he shot very badly, he was so fat and heavy, and as he grew daily fatter, he was at last obliged to give up walking, and be dragged about in a wheel-chair, and the people made fun of him, and gave him the name of my Lord Tubby  Now, the only trouble that Lord Tubby had was about his son, whom he loved very much, although they were not in the least alike, for the young Prince was as thin as a cuckoo  And what vexed him more than all was, that though the young ladies throughout all his lands did their best to make the Prince fall in love with them, he would have nothing to say to any of them, and told his father he did not wish to marry  Instead of chatting with them in the dusk, he wandered about the woods, whispering to the moon', " No wonder the young ladies thought him very odd, but they liked him all the better for that; and as he had received at his birth the name of Desire, they all called him d'Amour Desire", " 'What is the matter with you?' his father often said to him", " 'You have everything you can possibly wish for: a good bed, good food, and tuns full of beer", ' The only thing you want, in order to become as fat as a pig, is a wife that can bring you broad, rich lands  So marry, and you will be perfectly happy', "' 'I ask nothing better than to marry,' replied Desire, 'but I have never seen a woman that pleases me", ' All the girls here are pink and white, and I am tired to death of their eternal lilie and roses', " 'My faith!' cried Tubby; 'do you want to marry a negress, and give me grandchildren as ugly as monkeys and as stupid as owls?' 'No, father, nothing of the sort", ' But there must be women somewhere in the world who are neither pink nor white, and I tell you, once for all, that I will never marry until I have found one exactly to my taste', "'  Some time afterwards, it happened that the Prior of the Abbey of Saint Amand sent to the Lord of Avesnes a basket of oranges, with a beautifully-written letter saying that these golden fruit, then unknown in Flanders, came straight from a land where the sun always shone", ' That evening Tubby and his son ate the golden apples at supper, and thought them delicious  Next morning as the day dawned, Desire went down to the stable and saddled his pretty white horse  Then he went, all dressed for a journey, to the bedside of Tubby, and found him smoking his first pipe', " 'Father,' he said gravely, 'I have come to bid you farewell", ' Last night I dreamed that I was walking in a wood, where the trees were covered with golden apples  I gathered one of them, and when I opened it there came out a lovely princess with a golden skin  That is the wife I want, and I am going to look for her', "' The Lord of Avesnes was so much astonished that he let his pipe fall to the ground; then he became so diverted at the notion of his son marrying a yellow woman, and a woman shut up inside an orange, that he burst into fits of laughter", ' Desire waited to bid him good-bye until he was quiet again; but as his father went on laughing and showed no signs of stopping, the young man took his hand, kissed it tenderly, opened the door, and in the twinkling of an eye was as at the bottom of the staircase  He jumped lightly on his horse, and was a mile from home before Tubby had ceased laughing', " 'A yellow wife! He must be mad! fit for a strait waistcoat!' cried the good man, when he was able to speak", " 'Here! quick! bring him back to me", "' The servants mounted their horses and rode after the Prince; but as they did not know which road he had taken, they went all ways except the right one, and instead of bringing him back they returned themselves when it grew dark, with their horses worn out and covered with dust", '  When Desire thought they could no longer catch him, he pulled his horse into a walk, like a prudent man who knows he has far to go  A young man was out walking one day in Erin, leading a stout cart-horse by the bridle  He was thinking of his mother and how poor they were since his father, who was a fisherman, had been drowned at sea, and wondering what he should do to earn a living for both of them', " Suddenly a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a voice said to him: 'Will you sell me your horse, son of the fisherman?' and looking up he beheld a man standing in the road with a gun in his hand, a falcon on his shoulder, and a dog by his side", " 'What will you give me for my horse?' asked the youth", " 'Will you give me your gun, and your dog, and your falcon?' 'I will give them,' answered the man, and he took the horse, and the youth took the gun and the dog and the falcon, and went home with them", ' But when his mother heard what he had done she was very angry, and beat him with a stick which she had in her hand', " 'That will teach you to sell my property,' said she, when her arm was quite tired, but Ian her son answered her nothing, and went off to his bed, for he was very sore", ' That night he rose softly, and left the house carrying the gun with him', " 'I will not stay here to be beaten,' thought he, and he walked and he walked and he walked, till it was day again, and he was hungry and looked about him to see if he could get anything to eat", ' Not very far off was a farm-house, so he went there, and knocked at the door, and the farmer and his wife begged him to come in, and share their breakfast', " 'Ah, you have a gun,' said the farmer as the young man placed it in a corner", " 'That is well, for a deer comes every evening to eat my corn, and I cannot catch it", ' It is fortune that has sent you to me', "' 'I will gladly remain and shoot the deer for you,' replied the youth, and that night he hid himself and watched till the deer came to the cornfield; then he lifted his gun to his shoulder and was just going to pull the trigger, when, behold! instead of a deer, a woman with long black hair was standing there", ' At this sight his gun almost dropped from his hand in surprise, but as he looked, there was the deer eating the corn again  And thrice this happened, till the deer ran away over the moor, and the young man after her  On they went, on and on and one, till they reached a cottage which was thatched with heather', " With a bound the deer sprang on the roof, and lay down where none could see her, but as she did so she called out, 'Go in, fisher's son, and eat and drink while you may", "' So he entered and found food and wine on the table, but no man, for the house belonged to some robbers, who were still away at their wicked business", " After Ian, the fisher's son, had eaten all he wanted, he hid himself behind a great cask, and very soon he heard a noise, as of men coming through the heather, and the small twigs snapping under their feet", ' From his dark corner he could see into the room, and he counted four and twenty of them, all big, cross-looking men', " 'Some one has been eating our dinner,' cried they, 'and there was hardly enough for ourselves", "' 'It is the man who is lying under the cask,' answered the leader", " 'Go and kill him, and then come and eat your food and sleep, for we must be off betimes in the morning", "' So four of them killed the fisher's son and left him, and then went to bed", ' By sunrise they were all out of the house, for they had far to go  And when they had disappeared the deer came off the roof, to where the dead man lay, and she shook her head over him, and wax fell from her ear, and he jumped up as well as ever', " 'Trust me and eat as you did before, and no harm shall happen to you,' said she", ' So Ian ate and drank, and fell sound asleep under the cask  In the evening the robbers arrived very tired, and crosser than they had been yesterday, for their luck had turned and they had brought back scarcely anything  Once upon a time an old woman lived in a small cottage near the sea with her two daughters  They were very poor, and the girls seldom left the house, as they worked all day long making veils for the ladies to wear over their faces, and every morning, when the veils were finished, the other took them over the bridge and sold them in the city  Then she bought the food that they needed for the day, and returned home to do her share of veil-making  One morning the old woman rose even earlier than usual, and set off for the city with her wares  She was just crossing the bridge when, suddenly, she knocked up against a human head, which she had never seen there before  The woman started back in horror; but what was her surprise when the head spoke, exactly as if it had a body joined on to it', " 'Take me with you, good mother!' it said imploringly; 'take me with you back to your house", "' At the sound of these words the poor woman nearly went mad with terror", ' Have that horrible thing always at home? Never! never! And she turned and ran back as fast as she could, not knowing that the head was jumping, dancing, and rolling after her  But when she reached her own door it bounded in before her, and stopped in front of the fire, begging and praying to be allowed to stay  All that day there was no food in the house, for the veils had not been sold, and they had no money to buy anything with  So they all sat silent at their work, inwardly cursing the head which was the cause of their misfortunes', " When evening came, and there was no sign of supper, the head spoke, for the first time that day: 'Good mother, does no one ever eat here? During all the hours I have spent in your house not a creature has touched anything", "' 'No,' answered the old woman, 'we are not eating anything", "' 'And why not, good mother?' 'Because we have no money to buy any food", "' 'Is it your custom never to eat?' 'No, for every morning I go into the city to sell my veils, and with the few shillings I get for them I buy all we want", ' To-day I did not cross the bridge, so of course I had nothing for food', "' 'Then I am the cause of your having gone hungry all day?' asked the head", " 'Yes, you are,' answered the old woman", " 'Well, then, I will give you money and plenty of it, if you will only do as I tell you", ' In an hour, as the clock strikes twelve, you must be on the bridge at the place where you met me  When you get there call out "Ahmed," three times, as loud as you can  Then a negro will appear, and you must say to him: "The head, your master, desires you to open the trunk, and to give me the green purse which you will find in it "\' \'Very well, my lord,\' said the old woman, \'I will set off at once for the bridge', "' And wrapping her veil round her she went out", ' Midnight was striking as she reached the spot where she had met the head so many hours before', " 'Ahmed! Ahmed! Ahmed!' cried she, and immediately a huge negro, as tall as a giant, stood on the bridge before her", " 'What do you want?' asked he", " 'The head, your master, desires you to open the trunk, and to give me the green purse which you will find in it", "' 'I will be back in a moment, good mother,' said he" ,  ' It was the Feast of the New Year, the oldest and most splendid of all the feasts in the Kingdom of Persia, and the day had been spent by the king in the city of Schiraz, taking part in the magnificent spectacles prepared by his subjects to do honour to the festival  The sun was setting, and the monarch was about to give his court the signal to retire, when suddenly an Indian appeared before his throne, leading a horse richly harnessed, and looking in every respect exactly like a real one  "Sire," said he, prostrating himself as he spoke, "although I make my appearance so late before your Highness, I can confidently assure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the day can be compared to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyes upon him " "I see nothing in it," replied the king, "except a clever imitation of a real one; and any skilled workman might do as much " "Sire," returned the Indian, "it is not of his outward form that I would speak, but of the use that I can make of him  I have only to mount him, and to wish myself in some special place, and no matter how distant it may be, in a very few moments I shall find myself there  It is this, Sire, that makes the horse so marvellous, and if your Highness will allow me, you can prove it for yourself " The King of Persia, who was interested in every thing out of the common, and had never before come across a horse with such qualities, bade the Indian mount the animal, and show what he could do  In an instant the man had vaulted on his back, and inquired where the monarch wished to send him  "Do you see that mountain?" asked the king, pointing to a huge mass that towered into the sky about three leagues from Schiraz; "go and bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the foot " The words were hardly out of the king\'s mouth when the Indian turned a screw placed in the horse\'s neck, close to the saddle, and the animal bounded like lightning up into the air, and was soon beyond the sight even of the sharpest eyes  In a quarter of an hour the Indian was seen returning, bearing in his hand the palm, and, guiding his horse to the foot of the throne, he dismounted, and laid the leaf before the king  Now the monarch had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of which the horse was capable than he longed to possess it himself, and indeed, so sure was he that the Indian would be quite ready to sell it, that he looked upon it as his own already  "I never guessed from his mere outside how valuable an animal he was," he remarked to the Indian, "and I am grateful to you for having shown me my error," said he  "If you will sell it, name your own price " "Sire," replied the Indian, "I never doubted that a sovereign so wise and accomplished as your Highness would do justice to my horse, when he once knew its power; and I even went so far as to think it probable that you might wish to possess it  Greatly as I prize it, I will yield it up to your Highness on one condition  The horse was not constructed by me, but it was given me by the inventor, in exchange for my only daughter, who made me take a solemn oath that I would never part with it, except for some object of equal value " "Name anything you like," cried the monarch, interrupting him  "My kingdom is large, and filled with fair cities  You have only to choose which you would prefer, to become its ruler to the end of your life " "Sire," answered the Indian, to whom the proposal did not seem nearly so generous as it appeared to the king, "I am most grateful to your Highness for your princely offer, and beseech you not to be offended with me if I say that I can only deliver up my horse in exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter " A shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these words, and Prince Firouz Schah, the heir apparent, was filled with anger at the Indian\'s presumption  The king, however, thought that it would not cost him much to part from the princess in order to gain such a delightful toy, and while he was hesitating as to his answer the prince broke in  "Sire," he said, "it is not possible that you can doubt for an instant what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain  Consider what you owe to yourself, and to the blood of your ancestors " "My son," replied the king, "you speak nobly, but you do not realise either the value of the horse, or the fact that if I reject the proposal of the Indian, he will only make the same to some other monarch, and I should be filled with despair at the thought that anyone but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World', " Of course I do not say that I shall accept his conditions, and perhaps he may be brought to reason, but meanwhile I should like you to examine the horse, and, with the owner's permission, to make trial of its powers", '" The Indian, who had overheard the king\'s speech, thought that he saw in it signs of yielding to his proposal, so he joyfully agreed to the monarch\'s wishes, and came forward to help the prince to mount the horse, and show him how to guide it: but, before he had finished, the young man turned the screw, and was soon out of sight  They waited some time, expecting that every moment he might be seen returning in the distance, but at length the Indian grew frightened, and prostrating himself before the throne, he said to the king, "Sire, your Highness must have noticed that the prince, in his impatience, did not allow me to tell him what it was necessary to do in order to return to the place from which he started  Once upon a time there lived a young man who vowed that he would never marry any girl who had not royal blood in her veins  One day he plucked up all his courage and went to the palace to ask the emperor for his daughter', " The emperor was not much pleased at the thought of such a match for his only child, but being very polite, he only said: 'Very well, my son, if you can win the princess you shall have her, and the conditions are these", ' In eight days you must manage to tame and bring to me three horses that have never felt a master  The first is pure white, the second a foxy-red with a black head, the third coal black with a white head and feet  And besides that, you must also bring as a present to the empress, my wife, as much gold as the three horses can carry', "' The young man listened in dismay to these words, but with an effort he thanked the emperor for his kindness and left the palace, wondering how he was to fulfil the task allotted to him", " Luckily for him, the emperor's daughter had overheard everything her father had said, and peeping through a curtain had seen the youth, and thought him handsomer than anyone she had ever beheld", ' So returning hastily to her own room, she wrote him a letter which she gave to a trusty servant to deliver, begging her wooer to come to her rooms early the next day, and to undertake nothing without her advice, if he ever wished her to be his wife  That night, when her father was asleep, she crept softly into his chamber and took out an enchanted knife from the chest where he kept his treasures, and hid it carefully in a safe place before she went to bed', " The sun had hardly risen the following morning when the princess's nurse brought the young man to her apartments", " Neither spoke for some minutes, but stood holding each other's hands for joy, till at last they both cried out that nothing but death should part them", " Then the maiden said: 'Take my horse, and ride straight through the wood towards the sunset till you come to a hill with three peaks", ' When you get there, turn first to the right and then to the left, and you will find yourself in a sun meadow, where many horses are feeding  Out of these you must pick out the three described to you by my father  If they prove shy, and refuse to let you get near them, draw out your knife, and let the sun shine on it so that the whole meadow is lit up by its rays, and the horses will then approach you of their own accord, and will let you lead them away  When you have them safely, look about till you see a cypress tree, whose roots are of brass, whose boughs are of silver, and whose leaves are of gold  Go to it, and cut away the roots with your knife, and you will come to countless bags of gold  Load the horses with all they can carry, and return to my father, and tell him that you have done your task, and can claim me for your wife', "' The princess had finished all she had to say, and now it depended on the young man to do his part", ' He hid the knife in the folds of his girdle, mounted his horse, and rode off in search of the meadow  This he found without much difficulty, but the horses were all so shy that they galloped away directly he approached them  Then he drew his knife, and held it up towards the sun, and directly there shone such a glory that the whole meadow was bathed in it  From all sides the horses rushed pressing round, and each one that passed him fell on its knees to do him honour  But he only chose from them all the three that the emperor had described  These he secured by a silken rope to his own horse, and then looked about for the cypress tree  It was standing by itself in one corner, and in a moment he was beside it, tearing away the earth with his knife  Deeper and deeper he dug, till far down, below the roots of brass, his knife struck upon the buried treasure, which lay heaped up in bags all around', " With a great effort he lifted them from their hiding place, and laid them one by one on his horses' backs, and when they could carry no more he led them back to the emperor", ' And when the emperor saw him, he wondered, but never guessed how it was the young man had been too clever for him, till the betrothal ceremony was over  ONCE upon a time there lived a King who had three daughters', " Now it happened that he had to go out to battle, so he called his daughters and said to them: 'My dear children, I am obliged to go to the wars", ' The enemy is approaching us with a large army  It is a great grief to me to leave you all  During my absence take care of yourselves and be good girls; behave well and look after everything in the house  You may walk in the garden, and you may go into all the rooms in the palace, except the room at the back in the right-hand corner; into that you must not enter, for harm would befall you', "' 'You may keep your mind easy, father,' they replied", " 'We have never been disobedient to you", " Go in peace, and may heaven give you a glorious victory!' When everything was ready for his departure, the King gave them the keys of all the rooms and reminded them once more of what he had said", ' His daughters kissed his hands with tears in their eyes, and wished him prosperity, and he gave the eldest the keys  Now when the girls found themselves alone they felt so sad and dull that they did not know what to do  So, to pass the time, they decided to work for part of the day, to read for part of the day, and to enjoy themselves in the garden for part of the day  As long as they did this all went well with them  But this happy state of things did not last long  Every day they grew more and more curious, and you will see what the end of that was', " 'Sisters,' said the eldest Princess, 'all day long we sew, spin, and read", ' We have been several days quite alone, and there is no corner of the garden that we have not explored', " We have been in all the rooms of our father's palace, and have admired the rich and beautiful furniture: why should not we go into the room that our father forbad us to enter?' Sister,' said the youngest, 'I cannot think how you can tempt us to break our father's command", ' When he told us not to go into that room he must have known what he was saying, and have had a good reason for saying it', "' 'Surely the sky won't fall about our heads if we DO go in,' said the second Princess", " 'Dragons and such like monsters that would devour us will not be hidden in the room", " And how will our father ever find out that we have gone in?' While they were speaking thus, encouraging each other, they had reached the room; the eldest fitted the key into the lock, and snap! the door stood open", ' The three girls entered, and what do you think they saw? The room was quite empty, and without any ornament, but in the middle stood a large table, with a gorgeous cloth, and on it lay a big open book', " Now the Princesses were curious to know what was written in the book, especially the eldest, and this is what she read: 'The eldest daughter of this King will marry a prince from the East", "' Then the second girl stepped forward, and turning over the page she read: 'The second daughter of this King will marry a prince from the West", "' The girls were delighted, and laughed and teased each other", ' But the youngest Princess did not want to go near the table or to open the book', " Her elder sisters however left her no peace, and will she, nill she, they dragged her up to the table, and in fear and trembling she turned over the page and read: 'The youngest daughter of this King will be married to a pig from the North", "' Now if a thunderbolt had fallen upon her from heaven it would not have frightened her more", ' She almost died of misery, and if her sisters had not held her up, she would have sunk to the ground and cut her head open  One time a knook became tired of his beautiful life and longed for something new to do  The knooks have more wonderful powers than any other immortal folk--except, perhaps, the fairies and ryls  So one would suppose that a knook who might gain anything he desired by a simple wish could not be otherwise than happy and contented  But such was not the case with Popopo, the knook we are speaking of  He had lived thousands of years, and had enjoyed all the wonders he could think of  Yet life had become as tedious to him now as it might be to one who was unable to gratify a single wish  Finally, by chance, Popopo thought of the earth people who dwell in cities, and so he resolved to visit them and see how they lived  This would surely be fine amusement, and serve to pass away many wearisome hours  Therefore one morning, after a breakfast so dainty that you could scarcely imagine it, Popopo set out for the earth and at once was in the midst of a big city  His own dwelling was so quiet and peaceful that the roaring noise of the town startled him  His nerves were so shocked that before he had looked around three minutes he decided to give up the adventure, and instantly returned home  This satisfied for a time his desire to visit the earth cities, but soon the monotony of his existence again made him restless and gave him another thought  At night the people slept and the cities would be quiet  He would visit them at night  So at the proper time Popopo transported himself in a jiffy to a great city, where he began wandering about the streets  Everyone was in bed  No wagons rattled along the pavements; no throngs of busy men shouted and halloaed  Even the policemen slumbered slyly and there happened to be no prowling thieves abroad  His nerves being soothed by the stillness, Popopo began to enjoy himself  He entered many of the houses and examined their rooms with much curiosity  Locks and bolts made no difference to a knook, and he saw as well in darkness as in daylight  After a time he strolled into the business portion of the city  Stores are unknown among the immortals, who have no need of money or of barter and exchange; so Popopo was greatly interested by the novel sight of so many collections of goods and merchandise', " During his wanderings he entered a millinery shop, and was surprised to see within a large glass case a great number of women's hats, each bearing in one position or another a stuffed bird", ' Indeed, some of the most elaborate hats had two or three birds upon them  Now knooks are the especial guardians of birds, and love them dearly  To see so many of his little friends shut up in a glass case annoyed and grieved Popopo, who had no idea they had purposely been placed upon the hats by the milliner  So he slid back one of the doors of the case, gave the little chirruping whistle of the knooks that all birds know well, and called: "Come, friends; the door is open--fly out!" Popopo did not know the birds were stuffed; but, stuffed or not, every bird is bound to obey a knook\'s whistle and a knook\'s call  So they left the hats, flew out of the case and began fluttering about the room  "Poor dears!" said the kind-hearted knook, "you long to be in the fields and forests again' ,  " Once upon a time there lived near a forest a man and his wife and two girls; one girl was the daughter of the man, and the other the daughter of his wife; and the man's daughter was good and beautiful, but the woman's daughter was cross and ugly", ' However, her mother did not know that, but thought her the most bewitching maiden that ever was seen  One day the man called to his daughter and bade her come with him into the forest to cut wood  They worked hard all day, but in spite of the chopping they were very cold, for it rained heavily, and when they returned home, they were wet through  Then, to his vexation, the man found that he had left his axe behind him, and he knew that if it lay all night in the mud it would become rusty and useless', " So he said to his wife: 'I have dropped my axe in the forest, bid your daughter go and fetch it, for mine has worked hard all day and is both wet and weary", "' But the wife answered: 'If your daughter is wet already, it is all the more reason that she should go and get the axe", ' Besides, she is a great strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold', "' By long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more, and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe", ' The walk took some time, for it was very dark, and her shoes often stuck in the mud, but she was brave as well as beautiful and never thought of turning back merely because the path was both difficult and unpleasant  At last, with her dress torn by brambles that she could not see, and her fact scratched by the twigs on the trees, she reached the spot where she and her father had been cutting in the morning, and found the axe in the place he had left it  To her surprise, three little doves were sitting on the handle, all of them looking very sad', " 'You poor little things,' said the girl, stroking them", " 'Why do you sit there and get wet? Go and fly home to your nest, it will be much warmer than this; but first eat this bread, which I saved from my dinner, and perhaps you will feel happier", " It is my father's axe you are sitting on, and I must take it back as fast as I can, or I shall get a terrible scolding from my stepmother", "' She then crumbled the bread on the ground, and was pleased to see the doves flutter quite cheerfully towards it", " 'Good-bye,' she said, picking up the axe, and went her way homewards", ' By the time they had finished all the crumbs the doves felt must better, and were able to fly back to their nest in the top of a tree', " 'That is a good girl,' said one; 'I really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came", ' I should like to do something to show how grateful I am', "' 'Well, let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it,' cried another", " 'And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers,' rejoined the third", " 'Yes, that will do beautifully,' said the first", ' And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen  The father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy', " 'How absurd to walk about on such a pouring night, dressed up like that,' she remarked crossly, and roughly pulled off the wreath as she spoke, to place it on her own daughter", ' As she did so the roses became withered and brown, and the birds flew out of the window', " 'See what a trumpery thing it is!' cried the stepmother; 'and now take your supper and go to bed, for it is near upon midnight", "' But though she pretended to despise the wreath, she longed none the less for her daughter to have one like it", ' Now it happened that the next evening the father, who had been alone in the forest, came back a second time without his axe  Long, long ago an old couple lived in a village, and, as they had no children to love and care for, they gave all their affection to a little dog  He was a pretty little creature, and instead of growing spoilt and disagreeable at not getting everything he wanted, as even children will do sometimes, the dog was grateful to them for their kindness, and never left their side, whether they were in the house or out of it  One day the old man was working in his garden, with his dog, as usual, close by  The morning was hot, and at last he put down his spade and wiped his wet forehead, noticing, as he did so, that the animal was snuffling and scratching at a spot a little way off  There was nothing very strange in this, as all dogs are fond of scratching, and he went on quietly with his digging, when the dog ran up to his master, barking loudly, and back again to the place where he had been scratching  This he did several times, till the old man wondered what could be the matter, and, picking up the spade, followed where the dog led him  The dog was so delighted at his success that he jumped round, barking loudly, till the noise brought the old woman out of the house  Curious to know if the dog had really found anything, the husband began to dig, and very soon the spade struck against something  He stooped down and pulled out a large box, filled quite full with shining gold pieces  The box was so heavy that the old woman had to help to carry it home, and you may guess what a supper the dog had that night! Now that he had made them rich, they gave him every day all that a dog likes best to eat, and the cushions on which he lay were fit for a prince', " The story of the dog and his treasure soon became known, and a neighbour whose garden was next the old people's grew so envious of their good luck that he could neither eat nor sleep", ' As the dog had discovered a treasure once, this foolish man thought he must be able to discover one always, and begged the old couple to lend him their pet for a little while, so that he might be made rich also', " 'How can you ask such a thing?' answered the old man indignantly", " 'You know how much we love him, and that he is never out of our sight for five minutes", "' But the envious neighbour would not heed his words, and came daily with the same request, till at last the old people, who could not bear to say no to anyone, promised to lend the dog, just for a night or two", ' No sooner did the man get hold of the dog than he turned him into the garden, but the dog did nothing but race about, and the man was forced to wait with what patience he could  The next morning the man opened the house door, and the dog bounded joyfully into the garden, and, running up to the foot of a tree, began to scratch wildly  The man called loudly to his wife to bring a spade, and followed the dog, as he longed to catch the first glimpse of the expected treasure  But when he had dug up the ground, what did he find? Why, nothing but a parcel of old bones, which smelt so badly that he could not stay there a moment longer  And his heart was filled with rage against the dog who had played him this trick, and he seized a pickaxe and killed it on the spot, before he knew what he was doing', " When he remembered that he would have to go with his story to the old man and his wife he was rather frightened, but there was nothing to be gained by putting it off, so he pulled a very long face and went to his neighbour's garden", " 'Your dog,' said he, pretending to weep, 'has suddenly fallen down dead, though I took every care of him, and gave him everything he could wish for", ' And I thought I had better come straight and tell you', "' Weeping bitterly, the old man went to fetch the body of his favourite, and brought it home and buried it under the fig-tree where he had found the treasure", ' From morning till night he and his wife mourned over their loss, and nothing could comfort them  At length, one night when he was asleep, he dreamt that the dog appeared to him and told him to cut down the fig-tree over his grave, and out of its wood to make a mortar  But when the old man woke and thought of his dream he did not feel at all inclined to cut down the tree, which bore well every year, and consulted his wife about it', " The woman did not hesitate a moment, and said that after what had happened before, the dog's advice must certainly be obeyed, so the tree was felled, and a beautiful mortar made from it", ' And when the season came for the rice crop to be gathered the mortar was taken down from its shelf, and the grains placed in it for pounding, when, lo and behold! in a twinkling of an eye, they all turned into gold pieces  At the sight of all this gold the hearts of the old people were glad, and once more they blessed their faithful dog As the princess lay and sobbed she kept feeling the thread mechanically, following it with her finger many times up to the stones in which it disappeared  By and by she began, still mechanically, to poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could  All at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the stones and see where the thread went next  Almost laughing at herself for never having thought of this before, she jumped to her feet', " Her fear vanished; once more she was certain her grandmother's thread could not have brought her there just to leave her there; and she began to throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could, sometimes two or three at a handful, sometimes taking both hands to lift one", ' After clearing them away a little, she found that the thread turned and went straight downwards  Hence, as the heap sloped a good deal, growing of course wider towards its base, she had to throw away a multitude of stones to follow the thread  But this was not all, for she soon found that the thread, after going straight down for a little way, turned first sideways in one direction, then sideways in another, and then shot, at various angles, hither and thither inside the heap, so that she began to be afraid that to clear the thread she must remove the whole huge gathering  She was dismayed at the very idea, but, losing no time, set to work with a will; and with aching back, and bleeding fingers and hands, she worked on, sustained by the pleasure of seeing the heap slowly diminish and begin to show itself on the opposite side of the fire  Another thing which helped to keep up her courage was that, as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread, instead of lying loose upon the stone, it tightened up; this made her sure that her grandmother was at the end of it somewhere  She had got about half-way down when she started, and nearly fell with fright', " Close to her ears as it seemed, a voice broke out singing:  'Jabber, bother, smash!  You'll have it all in a crash", "  Jabber, smash, bother!  You'll have the worst of the pother", "  Smash, bother, jabber!--' Here Curdie stopped, either because he could not find a rhyme to 'jabber', or because he remembered what he had forgotten when he woke up at the sound of Irene's labours, that his plan was to make the goblins think he was getting weak", ' But he had uttered enough to let Irene know who he was', " 'It's Curdie!' she cried joyfully", " 'Hush! hush!' came Curdie's voice again from somewhere", " 'Speak softly", "' 'Why, you were singing loud!' said Irene", " 'Yes", " But they know I am here, and they don't know you are", " Who are you?' 'I'm Irene,' answered the princess", " 'I know who you are quite well", " You're Curdie", "' 'Why, how ever did you come here, Irene?' 'My great-great-grandmother sent me; and I think I've found out why", " You can't get out, I suppose?' 'No, I can't", " What are you doing?' 'Clearing away a huge heap of stones", "' 'There's a princess!' exclaimed Curdie, in a tone of delight, but still speaking in little more than a whisper", " 'I can't think how you got here, though", "' 'My grandmother sent me after her thread" ,  ' Manawyddan the prince and his friend Pryderi were wanderers, for the brother of Manawyddan had been slain, and his throne taken from him  Very sorrowful was Manawyddan, but Pryderi was stout of heart, and bade him be of good cheer, as he knew a way out of his trouble', " 'And what may that be?' asked Manawyddan", " 'It is that thou marry my mother Rhiannon and become lord of the fair lands that I will give her for dowry", ' Never did any lady have more wit than she, and in her youth none was more lovely; even yet she is good to look upon', "' 'Thou art the best friend that ever a man had,' said Manawyddan", " 'Let us go now to seek Rhiannon, and the lands where she dwells", "' Then they set forth, but the news of their coming ran swifter still, and Rhiannon and Kieva, wife of Pryderi, made haste to prepare a feast for them", ' And Manawyddan found that Pryderi had spoken the truth concerning his mother, and asked if she would take him for her husband  Right gladly did she consent, and without delay they were married, and rode away to the hunt, Rhiannon and Manawyddan, Kieva and Pryderi, and they would not be parted from each other by night or by day, so great was the love between them  One day, when they were returned, they were sitting out in a green place, and suddenly the crash of thunder struck loudly on their ears, and a wall of mist fell between them, so that they were hidden one from the other  Trembling they sat till the darkness fled and the light shone again upon them, but in the place where they were wont to see cattle, and herds, and dwellings, they beheld neither house nor beast, nor man nor smoke; neither was any one remaining in the green place save these four only', " 'Whither have they gone, and my host also?' cried Manawyddan, and they searched the hall, and there was no man, and the castle, and there was none, and in the dwellings that were left was nothing save wild beasts", ' For a year these four fed on the meat that Manawyddan and Pryderi killed out hunting, and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather  For a time they desired nothing more, but when the next year began they grew weary', " 'We cannot spend our lives thus,' said Manawyddan at last, 'let us go into England and learn some trade by which we may live", "' So they left Wales, and went to Hereford, and there they made saddles, while Manawyddan fashioned blue enamel ornaments to put on their trappings", ' And so greatly did the townsfolk love these saddles, that no others were bought throughout the whole of Hereford, till the saddlers banded together and resolved to slay Manawyddan and his companions  When Pryderi heard of it, he was very wroth, and wished to stay and fight  But the counsels of Manawyddan prevailed, and they moved by night to another city', " 'What craft shall we follow?' asked Pryderi", " 'We will make shields,' answered Manawyddan", " 'But do we know anything of that craft?' answered Pryderi", " 'We will try it,' said Manawyddan, and they began to make shields, and fashioned them after the shape of the shields they had seen; and these likewise they enamelled", ' And so greatly did they prosper that no man in the town bought a shield except they had made it, till at length the shield-makers banded together as the saddlers had done, and resolved to slay them  But of this they had warning, and by night betook themselves to another town', " 'Let us take to making shoes,' said Manawyddan, 'for there are not any among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us", "' 'I know nothing of making shoes,' answered Pryderi, who in truth despised so peaceful a craft", " 'But I know,' replied Manawyddan, 'and I will teach thee to stitch", ' We will buy the leather ready dressed, and will make the shoes from it  There was, once upon a time, a widow, who had two daughters  The eldest was so much like her in the face and humour, that whoever looked upon the daughter saw the mother  They were both so disagreeable, and so proud, that there was no living with them  The youngest, who was the very picture of her father, for courtesy and sweetness of temper, was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever seen  As people naturally love their own likeness, this mother even doated on her eldest daughter, and at the same time had a horrible aversion for the youngest  She made her eat in the kitchen, and work continually  Among other things, this poor child was forced twice a day to draw water above a mile and a half off the house, and bring home a pitcher full of it  One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to her a poor woman, who begged of her to let her drink  "O ay, with all my heart, Goody," said this pretty maid; and rinsing immediately the pitcher, she took up some water from the clearest place of the fountain, and gave it to her, holding up the pitcher all the while, that she might drink the easier  The good woman having drank, said to her: "You are so very pretty, my dear, so good and so mannerly, that I cannot help giving you a gift" (for this was a Fairy, who had taken the form of a poor country-woman, to see how far the civility and good manners of this pretty girl would go)  "I will give you for gift," continued the Fairy, "that at every word you speak, there shall come out of your mouth either a flower, or a jewel " When this pretty girl came home, her mother scolded at her for staying so long at the fountain  "I beg your pardon, mamma," said the poor girl, "for not making more haste," and, in speaking these words, there came out of her mouth two roses, two pearls, and two diamonds  "What is this I see?" said her mother quite astonished, "I think I see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl\'s mouth! How happens this, child?" (This was the first time she ever called her child ) The poor creature told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping out infinite numbers of diamonds  "In good faith," cried the mother, "I must send my child thither', " Come hither, Fanny, look what comes out of thy sister's mouth when she speaks! Would'st not thou be glad, my dear, to have the same gift given to thee? Thou hast nothing else to do but go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a certain poor woman asks thee to let her drink, to give it her very civilly", '" "It would be a very fine sight indeed," said this ill-bred minx, "to see me go draw water!" "You shall go, hussey," said the mother, "and this minute " So away she went, but grumbling all the way, taking with her the best silver tankard in the house  She was no sooner at the fountain, than she saw coming out of the wood a lady most gloriously dressed, who came up to her, and asked to drink', " This was, you must know, the very Fairy who appeared to her sister, but had now taken the air and dress of a princess, to see how far this girl's rudeness would go", ' "Am I come hither," said the proud, saucy slut, "to serve you with water, pray? I suppose the silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship, was it? However, you may drink out of it, if you have a fancy " "You are not over and above mannerly," answered the Fairy, without putting herself in a passion  "Well then, since you have so little breeding, and are so disobliging, I give you for gift, that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad " So soon as her mother saw her coming, she cried out: "Well, daughter?" "Well, mother?" answered the pert hussey, throwing out of her mouth two vipers and two toads  "O mercy!" cried the mother, "what is it I see! O, it is that wretch her sister who has occasioned all this; but she shall pay for it"; and immediately she ran to beat her  The poor child fled away from her and went to hide herself in the forest, not far from thence', " The King's son, then on his return from hunting, met her, and seeing her so very pretty, asked her what she did there alone, and why she cried", ' "Alas! sir, my mamma has turned me out of doors " The King\'s son, who saw five or six pearls, and as many diamonds, come out of her mouth, desired her to tell him how that happened  Once upon a time there lived a man of learning and wealth who had an only son, named Hanina  To this son, who was grown up and married, he sent a messenger asking that he should immediately come to his father  Hanina obeyed, and found both his father and mother lying ill  "Know, my son," said the old man, "we are about to die  Grieve not, for it has been so ordained  We have been companions through life, and we are to be privileged to leave this world together  You will mourn for us the customary seven days  They will end on the eve of the festival of the Passover  On that day go forth into the market place and purchase the first thing offered to thee, no matter what it is, or what the cost that may be demanded  It will in due course bring thee good fortune  Hearken unto my words, my son, and all will be well " Hanina promised obedience to this strange injunction of his father, and events fell out in accordance with the old man\'s prediction  The aged couple died on the same day, were buried together and after the week of mourning, on the day preceding the Passover festival, Hanina made his way to the market place wondering what adventure was in store for him  He had scarcely entered the market place, where all manner of wares were displayed, when an old man approached him, carrying a silver casket of curious design  "Purchase this, my son," he said, "and it will bring thee good fortune " "What does it contain?" asked Hanina  "That I may not inform thee," was the reply  "Indeed I cannot, for I know not  Only the purchaser can open it at the feast which begins the Passover " Naturally, Hanina was impressed by these words  Matters were shaping just as his father foretold  "What is the price?" he asked  "A thousand gold pieces " That was an enormous sum, nearly the whole that he possessed, but Hanina, remembering his vow, paid the money and took the casket home  It was placed upon the table that night when the Passover festival began  On being opened it was found to contain a smaller casket  This was opened and out sprang a frog', " Hanina's wife was sorely disappointed, but she gave food to the frog which devoured everything greedily", ' So much did the creature eat that when the Passover had ended, in eight days it had grown to an enormous size  Hanina built a cabinet for his strange possession, but it continued to grow and soon required a special shed  There was once a little farmer and his wife living near Coolgarrow  They had three children, and my story happened while the youngest was a baby  The wife was a good wife enough, but her mind was all on her family and her farm, and she hardly ever went to her knees without falling asleep, and she thought the time spent in the chapel was twice as long as it need be  So, friends, she let her man and her two children go before her one day to Mass, while she called to consult a fairy man about a disorder one of her cows had  She was late at the chapel, and was sorry all the day after, for her husband was in grief about it, and she was very fond of him', " Late that night he was wakened up by the cries of his children calling out 'Mother! Mother!' When he sat up and rubbed his eyes, there was no wife by his side, and when he asked the little ones what was become of their mother, they said they saw the room full of nice little men and women, dressed in white and red and green, and their mother in the middle of them, going out by the door as if she was walking in her sleep", ' Out he ran, and searched everywhere round the house but, neither tale nor tidings did he get of her for many a day  Well, the poor man was miserable enough, for he was as fond of his woman as she was of him', " It used to bring the salt tears down his cheeks to see his poor children neglected and dirty, as they often were, and they'd be bad enough only for a kind neighbour that used to look in whenever she could spare time", ' The infant was away with a nurse  About six weeks after--just as he was going out to his work one morning--a neighbour, that used to mind women when they were ill, came up to him, and kept step by step with him to the field, and this is what she told him', " 'Just as I was falling asleep last night, I heard a horse's tramp on the grass and a knock at the door, and there, when I came out, was a fine-looking dark man, mounted on a black horse, and he told me to get ready in all haste, for a lady was in great want of me", ' As soon as I put on my cloak and things, he took me by the hand, and I was sitting behind him before I felt myself stirring  "Where are we going, sir?" says I  "You\'ll soon know," says he; and he drew his fingers across my eyes, and not a ray could I see  I kept a tight grip of him, and I little knew whether he was going backwards or forwards, or how long we were about it, till my hand was taken again, and I felt the ground under me  The fingers went the other way across my eyes, and there we were before a castle door, and in we went through a big hall and great rooms all painted in fine green colours, with red and gold bands and ornaments, and the finest carpets and chairs and tables and window curtains, and grand ladies and gentlemen walking about  At last we came to a bedroom, with a beautiful lady in bed, with a fine bouncing boy beside her  The lady clapped her hands, and in came the Dark Man and kissed her and the baby, and praised me, and gave me a bottle of green ointment to rub the child all over', " 'Well, the child I rubbed, sure enough; but my right eye began to smart, and I put up my finger and gave it a rub, and then stared, for never in all my life was I so frightened", ' The beautiful room was a big, rough cave, with water oozing over the edges of the stones and through the clay; and the lady, and the lord, and the child weazened, poverty-bitten creatures--nothing but skin and bone--and the rich dresses were old rags  I didn\'t let on that I found any difference, and after a bit says the Dark Man, "Go before me to the hall door, and I will be with you in a few moments, and see you safe home " Well, just as I turned into the outside cave, who should I see watching near the door but poor Molly  She looked round all terrified, and says she to me in a whisper, "I\'m brought here to nurse the child of the king and queen of the fairies; but there is one chance of saving me  All the court will pass the cross near Templeshambo next Friday night, on a visit to the fairies of Old Ross', " If John can catch me by the hand or cloak when I ride by, and has courage not to let go his grip, I'll be safe", " Here's the king", " Don't open your mouth to answer", ' I saw what happened with the ointment " \'The Dark Man didn\'t once cast his eye towards Molly, and he seemed to have no suspicion of me  Once upon a time what should happen DID happen; and if it had not happened this tale would never have been told  There was once an emperor, very great and mighty, and he ruled over an empire so large that no one knew where it began and where it ended', " But if nobody could tell the exact extent of his sovereignty everybody was aware that the emperor's right eye laughed, while his left eye wept", ' One or two men of valour had the courage to go and ask him the reason of this strange fact, but he only laughed and said nothing; and the reason of the deadly enmity between his two eyes was a secret only known to the monarch himself', " And all the while the emperor's sons were growing up", ' And such sons! All three like the morning stars in the sky! Florea, the eldest, was so tall and broad-shouldered that no man in the kingdom could approach him  Costan, the second, was quite different  Small of stature, and slightly built, he had a strong arm and stronger wrist  Petru, the third and youngest, was tall and thin, more like a girl than a boy  He spoke very little, but laughed and sang, sang and laughed, from morning till night', " He was very seldom serious, but then he had a way when he was thinking of stroking his hair over his forehead, which made him look old enough to sit in his father's council! 'You are grown up, Florea,' said Petru one day to his eldest brother; 'do go and ask father why one eye laughs and the other weeps", "' But Florea would not go", ' He had learnt by experience that this question always put the emperor in a rage  Petru next went to Costan, but did not succeed any better with him', " 'Well, well, as everyone else is afraid, I suppose I must do it myself,' observed Petru at length", ' No sooner said than done; the boy went straight to his father and put his question', " 'May you go blind!' exclaimed the emperor in wrath; 'what business is it of yours?' and boxed Petru's ears soundly", " Petru returned to his brothers, and told them what had befallen him; but not long after it struck him that his father's left eye seemed to weep less, and the right to laugh more", " 'I wonder if it has anything to do with my question,' thought he", " 'I'll try again! After all, what do two boxes on the ear matter?' So he put his question for the second time, and had the same answer; but the left eye only wept now and then, while the right eye looked ten years younger", " 'It really MUST be true,' thought Petru", " 'Now I know what I have to do", ' I shall have to go on putting that question, and getting boxes on the ear, till both eyes laugh together', "' No sooner said than done", ' Petru never, never forswore himself', " 'Petru, my dear boy,' cried the emperor, both his eyes laughing together, 'I see you have got this on the brain", ' Well, I will let you into the secret  My right eye laughs when I look at my three sons, and see how strong and handsome you all are, and the other eye weeps because I fear that after I die you will not be able to keep the empire together, and to protect it from its enemies  But if you can bring me water from the spring of the Fairy of the Dawn, to bathe my eyes, then they will laugh for evermore; for I shall know that my sons are brave enough to overcome any foe', "' Thus spoke the emperor, and Petru picked up his hat and went to find his brothers" ,  ' In a great and beautiful city that stood by the sea, an old man lay dying  Mar Shalmon was his name, and he was the richest man in the land  Propped up with pillows on a richly decorated bed in a luxurious chamber, he gazed, with tears in his eyes, through the open window at the setting sun  Like a ball of fire it sank lower and lower until it almost seemed to rest on the tranquil waters beyond the harbor  Suddenly, Mar Shalmon roused himself  "Where is my son, Bar Shalmon?" he asked in a feeble voice, and his hand crept tremblingly along the silken coverlet of the bed as if in search of something  "I am here, my father," replied his son who was standing by the side of his bed  His eyes were moist with tears, but his voice was steady  "My son," said the old man, slowly, and with some difficulty, "I am about to leave this world  My soul will take flight from this frail body when the sun has sunk behind the horizon  I have lived long and have amassed great wealth which will soon be thine  Use it well, as I have taught thee, for thou, my son, art a man of learning, as befits our noble Jewish faith  One thing I must ask thee to promise me " "I will, my father," returned Bar Shalmon, sobbing  "Nay, weep not, my son," said the old man  "My day is ended; my life has not been ill-spent  I would spare thee the pain that was mine in my early days, when, as a merchant, I garnered my fortune  The sea out there that will soon swallow up the sun is calm now  But beware of it, my son, for it is treacherous  Promise me--nay, swear unto me--that never wilt thou cross it to foreign lands " Bar Shalmon placed his hands on those of his father  "Solemnly I swear," he said, in a broken voice, "to do thy wish--never to journey on the sea, but to remain here in this, my native land', " 'Tis a vow before thee, my father", '" "\'Tis an oath before heaven," said the old man  "Guard it, keep it, and heaven will bless thee  Remember! See, the sun is sinking " Mar Shalmon fell back upon his pillows and spoke no more  Bar Shalmon stood gazing out of the window until the sun had disappeared, and then, silently sobbing, he left the chamber of death  The whole city wept when the sad news was made known, for Mar Shalmon was a man of great charity, and almost all the inhabitants followed the remains to the grave', " Then Bar Shalmon, his son, took his father's place of honor in the city, and in him, too, the poor and needy found a friend whose purse was ever open and whose counsel was ever wisdom" ,  ' There was once a fine gentleman, all of whose moveables were a boot-jack and a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world; and it is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story  It was so old, that it began to think of marriage; and it happened that it came to be washed in company with a garter  "Nay!" said the collar  "I never did see anything so slender and so fine, so soft and so neat  May I not ask your name?" "That I shall not tell you!" said the garter  "Where do you live?" asked the collar  But the garter was so bashful, so modest, and thought it was a strange question to answer  "You are certainly a girdle," said the collar; "that is to say an inside girdle  I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my dear young lady " "I will thank you not to speak to me," said the garter  "I think I have not given the least occasion for it " "Yes! When one is as handsome as you," said the collar, "that is occasion enough " "Don\'t come so near me, I beg of you!" said the garter  "You look so much like those men-folks " "I am also a fine gentleman," said the collar  "I have a bootjack and a hair-comb " But that was not true, for it was his master who had them: but he boasted  "Don\'t come so near me," said the garter: "I am not accustomed to it " "Prude!" exclaimed the collar; and then it was taken out of the washing-tub  It was starched, hung over the back of a chair in the sunshine, and was then laid on the ironing-blanket; then came the warm box-iron  "Dear lady!" said the collar  "Dear widow-lady! I feel quite hot  I am quite changed  I begin to unfold myself  You will burn a hole in me  Oh! I offer you my hand " "Rag!" said the box-iron; and went proudly over the collar: for she fancied she was a steam-engine, that would go on the railroad and draw the waggons  "Rag!" said the box-iron  The collar was a little jagged at the edge, and so came the long scissors to cut off the jagged part  "Oh!" said the collar  The king had just awakened from his midday sleep, for it was summer, and everyone rose early and rested from twelve to three, as they do in hot countries  He had dressed himself in cool white clothes, and was passing through the hall on his way to the council chamber, when a number of young nobles suddenly appeared before him, and one amongst them stepped forward and spoke', " 'Sire, this morning we were all playing tennis in the court, the prince and this gentleman with the rest, when there broke out some dispute about the game", ' The prince lost his temper, and said many insulting things to the other, who was playing against him, till at length the gentleman whom you see there struck him violently in the face, so that the blood ran from his mouth and nose  We were all so horrified at the sight, that we should most likely have killed the man then and there, for daring to lay hands on the prince, had not his grandfather the duke stepped between and commanded us to lay the affair before you', "' The king had listened attentively to the story, and when it was ended he said: 'I suppose the prince had no arms with him, or else he would have used them?' 'Yes, sire, he had arms; he always carries a dagger in his belt", ' But when he saw the blood pouring from his face, he went to a corner of the court and began to cry, which was the strangest thing of all', "' On hearing this the king walked to the window and stood for a few minutes with his back to the room, where the company of young men remained silent", ' Then he came back, his face white and stern', " 'I tell you,' he said, 'and it is the solemn truth, that I would rather you had told me that the prince was dead, though he is my only son, than know that he would suffer such an injury without attempting to avenge it", ' As for the gentleman who struck him, he will be brought before my judges, and will plead his own cause, but I hardly think he can escape death, after having assaulted the heir to the crown', "' The young man raised his head as if to reply, but the king would not listen, and commanded his guards to put him under arrest, adding, however, that if the prisoner wished to visit any part of the city, he was at liberty to do so properly guarded, and in fifteen days he would be brought to trial before the highest judges in the land", " The young man left the king's presence, surrounded by soldiers, and accompanied by many of his friends, for he was a great favourite", ' By their advice he spent the fourteen days that remained to him going about to seek counsel from wise men of all sorts, as to how he might escape death, but no one could help him, for none could find any excuse for the blow he had given to the prince  The fourteenth night had come, and in despair the prisoner went out to take his last walk through the city  He wandered on hardly knowing where he went, and his face was so white and desperate that none of his companions dared speak to him  The sad little procession had passed some hours in this manner, when, near the gate of a monastery, an old woman appeared round a corner, and suddenly stood before the young man  She was bent almost double, and was so wizened and wrinkled that she looked at least ninety; only her eyes were bright and quick as those of a girl', " 'Sir,' she said, 'I know all that has happened to you, and how you are seeking if in any wise you can save your life", ' But there is none that can answer that question save only I myself, if you will promise to do all I ask', "' At her words the prisoner felt as if a load had all at once been rolled off him", " 'Oh, save me, and I will do anything!' he cried", " 'It is so hard to leave the world and go out into the darkness", "' 'You will not need to do that,' answered the old woman, 'you have only got to marry me, and you will soon be free", "' 'Marry you?' exclaimed he, 'but--but--I am not yet twenty, and you --why, you must be a hundred at least! Oh, no, it is quite impossible", "' He spoke without thinking, but the flash of anger which darted from her eyes made him feel uncomfortable", " However, all she said was: 'As you like; since you reject me, let the crows have you,' and hurried away down the street", ' Left to himself, the full horror of his coming death rushed upon the young man, and he understood that he had thrown away his sole chance of life  Well, if he must, he must, he said to himself, and began to run as fast as he could after the old crone, who by this time could scarcely be seen, even in the moonlight', " Who would have believed a woman past ninety could walk with such speed? It seemed more like flying! But at length, breathless and exhausted, he reached her side, and gasped out: 'Madam, pardon me for my hasty words just now; I was wrong, and will thankfully accept the offer you made me" ,  ' Long, long ago, there lived an old farmer and his wife who had made their home in the mountains, far from any town  Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger', " This badger used to come out every night and run across to the farmer's field and spoil the vegetables and the rice which the farmer spent his time in carefully cultivating", ' The badger at last grew so ruthless in his mischievous work, and did so much harm everywhere on the farm, that the good-natured farmer could not stand it any longer, and determined to put a stop to it  So he lay in wait day after day and night after night, with a big club, hoping to catch the badger, but all in vain  Then he laid traps for the wicked animal', " The farmer's trouble and patience was rewarded, for one fine day on going his rounds he found the badger caught in a hole he had dug for that purpose", ' The farmer was delighted at having caught his enemy, and carried him home securely bound with rope  When he reached the house the farmer said to his wife: "I have at last caught the bad badger  You must keep an eye on him while I am out at work and not let him escape, because I want to make him into soup to-night " Saying this, he hung the badger up to the rafters of his storehouse and went out to his work in the fields  The badger was in great distress, for he did not at all like the idea of being made into soup that night, and he thought and thought for a long time, trying to hit upon some plan by which he might escape  It was hard to think clearly in his uncomfortable position, for he had been hung upside down', " Very near him, at the entrance to the storehouse, looking out towards the green fields and the trees and the pleasant sunshine, stood the farmer's old wife pounding barley", ' She looked tired and old  Her face was seamed with many wrinkles, and was as brown as leather, and every now and then she stopped to wipe the perspiration which rolled down her face  "Dear lady," said the wily badger, "you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old age  Won\'t you let me do that for you? My arms are very strong, and I could relieve you for a little while!" "Thank you for your kindness," said the old woman, "but I cannot let you do this work for me because I must not untie you, for you might escape if I did, and my husband would be very angry if he came home and found you gone " Now, the badger is one of the most cunning of animals, and he said again in a very sad, gentle, voice: "You are very unkind  You might untie me, for I promise not to try to escape  If you are afraid of your husband, I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding the barley  I am so tired and sore tied up like this  If you would only let me down for a few minutes I would indeed be thankful!" The old woman had a good and simple nature, and could not think badly of any one  Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away  She felt sorry, too, for the animal as she turned to look at him  He looked in such a sad plight hanging downwards from the ceiling by his legs, which were all tied together so tightly that the rope and the knots were cutting into the skin', " So in the kindness of her heart, and believing the creature's promise that he would not run away, she untied the cord and let him down", ' The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested  He took the pestle, but instead of doing the work as he was told, the badger at once sprang upon the old woman and knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood  He then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her, and waited for the return of the old farmer  There was once a farmer who suffered much at the hands of a money-lender  Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the money-lender rich  At the last, when he hadn\'t a farthing left, farmer went to the money-lender\'s house, and said, "You can\'t squeeze water from a stone, and as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tell me the secret of becoming rich " "My friend," returned the money-lender, piously, "riches come from Ram--ask _him_ " "Thank you, I will!" replied the simple farmer; so he prepared three girdle-cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram  First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking him to point out the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on his way without a word  Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to him he gave a cake, without receiving any help in return  At last, he came upon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry, the kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting down to rest beside him, entered into conversation  "And where are you going?" asked the poor man, at length  "Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!" replied the farmer  "I don\'t suppose you could tell me which way to go?" "Perhaps I can," said the poor man, smiling, "for _I_ am Ram! What do you want of me?" Then the farmer told the whole story, and Ram, taking pity on him, gave him a conch shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particular way, saying, "Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blow the conch that way, and your wish will be fulfilled  Only have a care of that money-lender, for even magic is not proof against their wiles!" The farmer went back to his village rejoicing  In fact the money-lender noticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself, "Some good fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow, to make him hold his head so jauntily " Therefore he went over to the simple farmer\'s house, and congratulated him on his good fortune, in such cunning words, pretending to have heard all about it, that before long the farmer found himself telling the whole story--all except the secret of blowing the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the farmer was not quite such a fool as to tell that  Nevertheless, the money-lender determined to have the conch by hook or by crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he waited for a favourable opportunity and stole the conch  But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every conceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job  However, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer, and said, coolly, "Look here; I\'ve got your conch, but I can\'t use it; you haven\'t got it, so it\'s clear you can\'t use it either  Business is at a stand-still unless we make a bargain  Now, I promise to give you back your conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on one condition, which is this,--whatever you get from it, I am to get double " "Never!" cried the farmer; "that would be the old business all over again!" "Not at all!" replied the wily money-lender; "you will have your share! Now, don\'t be a dog in the manger, for if _you_ get all you want, what can it matter to you if _I_ am rich or poor?" At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit to a money-lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time, no matter what he gained by the power of the conch, the money-lender gained double', " And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon the farmer's mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out of anything", " At last, there came a very dry season,--so dry that the farmer's crops withered for want of rain", ' Then he blew his conch, and wished for a well to water them, and lo! there was the well, _but the money-lender had two!_--two beautiful new wells! This was too much for any farmer to stand; and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till at last a bright idea came into his head  He seized the conch, blew it loudly, and cried out, "Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!" And so he was, in a twinkling, but the money-lender of course was blind of both, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he fell into one, and was drowned  Now this true story shows that a farmer once got the better of a money-lender--but only by losing one of his eyes      "Win victory and blessings, O Fionn," said Conan, "and tell me who was the man that, having only one leg, one arm, and one eye, escaped from you in consequence of his swiftness, and outstripped the Fenians of Eire, and why is this proverb used, \'As Roc came to the house of Fionn\'?" "I will tell you that," said Fionn  "One day the chief of the Fenians and I went to Teamhair Luachra, and we took nothing in the chase that same day but one fawn  When it had been cooked it was fetched to me for the purpose of dividing it  I gave a portion of it to each of the Fenian chiefs, and there remained none for my own share but a haunch bone  Gobha Gaoithe, son of Ronan, presented himself, and requested me to give him the haunch  I accordingly gave it to him  He then declared that I gave him that portion on account of his swiftness of foot: and he went out on the plain, but he had only gone a short distance when Caoilte, son of Ronan, his own brother, overtook him, and brought the haunch back again to me, and we had no further dispute about the matter  We had not been long so when we saw a huge, obnoxious, massy-boned, black, detestable giant, having only one eye, one arm, and one leg, hop forward towards us  He saluted us  I returned the salutation, and asked him whence he came', " 'I am come by the powers of the agility of my arm and leg,' responded he, 'having heard there is not one man in the world more liberal in bestowing gifts than you, O Fionn; therefore, I am come to solicit wealth and valuable gifts from you", "' I replied that were all the wealth of the world mine I would give him neither little nor much", " He then declared 'they were all liars who asserted that I never gave a refusal to any person", "' I replied that if he were a man I would not give him a refusal", " 'Well, then,' said the giant, 'let me have that haunch you have in your hand, and I will say good-bye to the Fenians, provided that you allow me the length of the haunch as a distance, and that I am not seized upon until I make my first hop", "' Upon hearing this I gave the haunch into the giant's hand, and he hopped over the lofty stockades of the town; he then made use of the utmost swiftness of his one leg to outstrip all the rest of the Fenians", ' When the Fenian chiefs saw that, they started in pursuit of the giant, while I and the band of minstrels of the town went to the top of the dun to watch their proceedings  When I saw that the giant had outstripped them a considerable distance, I put on my running habiliments, and, taking no weapon but Mac an Loin in my hand, I started after the others', " I overtook the hindmost division on Sliabh an Righ, the middle (next) division at Limerick, and the chiefs of the Fenians at Ath Bo, which is called Ath-Luain (Athlone), and those first in the pursuit at Rinn-an-Ruaigh, to the right-hand side of Cruachan of Connacht, where he (the giant) was distant less than a javelin's cast from me", ' The giant passed on before me and crossed Eas Roe (now Ballyshannon), of the son of Modhuirn, without wetting his foot  I leaped over it after him  He then directed his course towards the estuary of Binn-Edair, keeping the circuit of Eire to his right hand  The giant leaped over the estuary, and it was a leap similar to flight over the sea  I sprang after him, and having caught him by the small of the back, laid him prostrate on the earth', " 'You have dealt unjustly by me, O Fionn,' cried the giant; 'for it was not with you I arranged the combat, but with the Fenians", "' I replied that the Fenians were not perfect, except I myself were with them", ' We had not remained long thus when Liagan Luaimneach, from Luachar Deaghaidh, came to us  He was followed by Caoilte Mac Ronan, together with the swiftest of the Fenians  Each of them couched his javelin, intending to drive it through the giant and kill him in my arms, but I protected him from their attacks  Soon after this the main body of the Fenians arrived; they enquired what was the cause of the delay that the giant had not been slain  One fine day in harvest--it was indeed Lady-day in harvest, that everybody knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the year--Tom Fitzpatrick was taking a ramble through the ground, and went along the sunny side of a hedge; when all of a sudden he heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge  "Dear me," said Tom, "but isn\'t it surprising to hear the stonechatters singing so late in the season?" So Tom stole on, going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise, to see if he was right in his guess  The noise stopped; but as Tom looked sharply through the bushes, what should he see in a nook of the hedge but a brown pitcher, that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor; and by-and-by a little wee teeny tiny bit of an old man, with a little _motty_ of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head, a deeshy daushy leather apron hanging before him, pulled out a little wooden stool, and stood up upon it, and dipped a little piggin into the pitcher, and took out the full of it, and put it beside the stool, and then sat down under the pitcher, and began to work at putting a heel-piece on a bit of a brogue just fit for himself  "Well, by the powers," said Tom to himself, "I often heard tell of the Lepracauns, and, to tell God\'s truth, I never rightly believed in them--but here\'s one of them in real earnest', " If I go knowingly to work, I'm a made man", " They say a body must never take their eyes off them, or they'll escape", '" Tom now stole on a little further, with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse  So when he got up quite close to him, "God bless your work, neighbour," said Tom  The little man raised up his head, and "Thank you kindly," said he  "I wonder you\'d be working on the holiday!" said Tom  "That\'s my own business, not yours," was the reply  "Well, may be you\'d be civil enough to tell _us_ what you\'ve got in the pitcher there?" said Tom  "That I will, with pleasure," said he; "it\'s good beer " "Beer!" said Tom  "Thunder and fire! where did you get it?" "Where did I get it, is it? Why, I made it  And what do you think I made it of?" "Devil a one of me knows," said Tom; "but of malt, I suppose, what else?" "There you\'re out  I made it of heath " "Of heath!" said Tom, bursting out laughing; "sure you don\'t think me to be such a fool as to believe that?" "Do as you please," said he, "but what I tell you is the truth  Did you never hear tell of the Danes?" "Well, what about _them_?" said Tom  "Why, all the about them there is, is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath, and the secret\'s in my family ever since " "Will you give a body a taste of your beer?" said Tom  "I\'ll tell you what it is, young man, it would be fitter for you to be looking after your father\'s property than to be bothering decent quiet people with your foolish questions', " There now, while you're idling away your time here, there's the cows have broke into the oats, and are knocking the corn all about", '" Tom was taken so by surprise with this that he was just on the very point of turning round when he recollected himself; so, afraid that the like might happen again, he made a grab at the Lepracaun, and caught him up in his hand; but in his hurry he overset the pitcher, and spilt all the beer, so that he could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was  He then swore that he would kill him if he did not show him where his money was  Tom looked so wicked and so bloody-minded that the little man was quite frightened; so says he, "Come along with me a couple of fields off, and I\'ll show you a crock of gold " So they went, and Tom held the Lepracaun fast in his hand, and never took his eyes from off him, though they had to cross hedges and ditches, and a crooked bit of bog, till at last they came to a great field all full of boliauns, and the Lepracaun pointed to a big boliaun, and says he, "Dig under that boliaun, and you\'ll get the great crock all full of guineas " Tom in his hurry had never thought of bringing a spade with him, so he made up his mind to run home and fetch one; and that he might know the place again he took off one of his red garters, and tied it round the boliaun  Then he said to the Lepracaun, "Swear ye\'ll not take that garter away from that boliaun " And the Lepracaun swore right away not to touch it  At the edge of a wood there lived an old man who had only one son, and one day he called the boy to him and said he wanted some corn ground, but the youth must be sure never to enter any mill where the miller was beardless  The boy took the corn and set out, and before he had gone very far he saw a large mill in front of him, with a beardless man standing in the doorway', " 'Good greeting, beardless one!' cried he", " 'Good greeting, sonny,' replied the man", " 'Could I grind something here?' 'Yes, certainly! I will finish what I am doing and then you can grind as long as you like", "' But suddenly the boy remembered what his father had told him, and bade farewell to the man, and went further down the river, till he came to another mill, not knowing that as soon as his back was turned the beardless man had picked up a bag of corn and run hastily to the same mill before him", ' When the boy reached the second mill, and saw a second beardless man sitting there, he did not stop, and walked on till he came to a third mill  But this time also the beardless man had been too clever for him, and had arrived first by another road', " When it happened a fourth time the boy grew cross, and said to himself, 'It is no good going on; there seems to be a beardless man in every mill'; and he took his sack from his back, and made up his mind to grind his corn where he was", " The beardless man finished grinding his own corn, and when he had done he said to the boy, who was beginning to grind his, 'Suppose, sonny, we make a cake of what you have there", "' Now the boy had been rather uneasy when he recollected his father's words, but he thought to himself, 'What is done cannot be undone,' and answered, 'Very well, so let it be", "' Then the beardless one got up, threw the flour into the tub, and made a hole in the middle, telling the boy to fetch some water from the river in his two hands, to mix the cake", ' When the cake was ready for baking they put it on the fire, and covered it with hot ashes, till it was cooked through', " Then they leaned it up against the wall, for it was too big to go into a cupboard, and the beardless one said to the boy: 'Look here, sonny: if we share this cake we shall neither of us have enough", ' Let us see who can tell the biggest lie, and the one who lies the best shall have the whole cake', "' The boy, not knowing what else to do, answered, 'All right; you begin", "' So the beardless one began to lie with all his might, and when he was tired of inventing new lies the boy said to him, 'My good fellow, if THAT is all you can do it is not much! Listen to me, and I will tell you a true story", " 'In my youth, when I was an old man, we had a quantity of beehives", ' Every morning when I got up I counted them over, and it was quite easy to number the bees, but I never could reckon the hives properly  One day, as I was counting the bees, I discovered that my best bee was missing, and without losing a moment I saddled a cock and went out to look for him  I traced him as far as the shore, and knew that he had crossed the sea, and that I must follow  When I had reached the other side I found a man had harnessed my bee to a plough, and with his help was sowing millet seed  \'"That is my bee!" I shouted  "Where did you get him from?"\' "Brother," replied the man, "if he is yours, take him " And he not only gave me back my bee, but a sack of millet seed into the bargain, because he had made use of my bee  Then I put the bag on my shoulders, took the saddle from the cock, and placed it on the back of the bee, which I mounted, leading the cock by a string, so that he should have a rest  As we were flying home over the sea one of the strings that held the bag of millet broke in two, and the sack dropped straight into the ocean  It was quite lost, of course, and there was no use thinking about it, and by the time we were safe back again night had come  I then got down from my bee, and let him loose, that he might get his supper, gave the cock some hay, and went to sleep myself  But when I awoke with the sun what a scene met my eyes! During the night wolves had come and had eaten my bee  There was once a pretty little fir-tree in a wood  It was in a capital position, for it could get sun, and there was enough air, and all around grew many tall companions, both pines and firs  It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air, or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries', " Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw; they would sit down by the little fir-tree and say, 'What a pretty little one this is!' The tree did not like that at all", " By the next year it had grown a whole ring taller, and the year after that another ring more, for you can always tell a fir-tree's age from its rings", " 'Oh! if I were only a great tree like the others!' sighed the little fir-tree, 'then I could stretch out my branches far and wide and look out into the great world! The birds would build their nests in my branches, and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others!' It took no pleasure in the sunshine, nor in the birds, nor in the rose-coloured clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset", ' Then the winter came, and the snow lay white and sparkling all around, and a hare would come and spring right over the little fir-tree, which annoyed it very much  But when two more winters had passed the fir-tree was so tall that the hare had to run round it', " 'Ah! to grow and grow, and become great and old! that is the only pleasure in life,' thought the tree", ' In the autumn the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees; this happened every year, and the young fir-tree would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground, their branches hewn off, and the great trunks left bare, so that they were almost unrecognisable  But then they were laid on waggons and dragged out of the wood by horses', " 'Where are they going? What will happen to them?' In spring, when the swallows and storks came, the fir-tree asked them, 'Do you know where they were taken? Have you met them?' The swallows knew nothing of them, but the stork nodded his head thoughtfully, saying, 'I think I know", ' I met many new ships as I flew from Egypt; there were splendid masts on the ships', " I'll wager those were they! They had the scent of fir-trees", " Ah! those are grand, grand!' 'Oh! if I were only big enough to sail away over the sea too! What sort of thing is the sea? what does it look like?' 'Oh! it would take much too long to tell you all that,' said the stork, and off he went", " 'Rejoice in your youth,' said the sunbeams, 'rejoice in the sweet growing time, in the young life within you", "' And the wind kissed it and the dew wept tears over it, but the fir-tree did not understand", ' Towards Christmas-time quite little trees were cut down, some not as big as the young fir-tree, or just the same age, and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away  These little trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept all their branches; they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses', " 'Whither are those going?' asked the fir-tree; 'they are no bigger than I, and one there was much smaller even! Why do they keep their branches? Where are they taken to?' 'We know! we know!' twittered the sparrows", " 'Down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows, we know where they go! They attain to the greatest splendour and magnificence you can imagine! We have looked in at the windows and seen them planted in the middle of the warm room and adorned with the most beautiful things-golden apples, sweet-meats, toys and hundreds of candles", "' 'And then?' asked the fir-tree, trembling in every limb with eagerness, 'and then? what happens then?' 'Oh, we haven't seen anything more than that", " That was simply matchless!' 'Am I too destined to the same brilliant career?' wondered the fir-tree excitedly", " 'That is even better than sailing over the sea! I am sick with longing", ' If it were only Christmas! Now I am tall and grown-up like those which were taken away last year', " Ah, if I were only in the cart! If I were only in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence! And then? Then comes something better, something still more beautiful, else why should they dress us up? There must be something greater, something grander to come--but what? Oh! I am pining away! I really don't know what's the matter with me!' 'Rejoice in us,' said the air and sunshine, 'rejoice in your fresh youth in the free air!' But it took no notice, and just grew and grew; there it stood fresh and green in winter and summer, and all who saw it said, 'What a beautiful tree!' And at Christmas-time it was the first to be cut down", ' The axe went deep into the pith; the tree fell to the ground with a groan; it felt bruised and faint  It could not think of happiness, it was sad at leaving its home, the spot where it had sprung up; it knew, too, that it would never see again its dear old companions, or the little shrubs and flowers, perhaps not even the birds  Altogether the parting was not pleasant', " When the tree came to itself again it was packed in a yard with other trees, and a man was saying, 'This is a splendid one, we shall only want this" ,  ' Once upon a time a strong and powerful Tzar ruled in a country far away  And among his servants was a young archer, and this archer had a horse--a horse of power--such a horse as belonged to the wonderful men of long ago--a great horse with a broad chest, eyes like fire, and hoofs of iron  There are no such horses nowadays  They sleep with the strong men who rode them, the bogatirs, until the time comes when Russia has need of them  Then the great horses will thunder up from under the ground, and the valiant men leap from the graves in the armour they have worn so long  The strong men will sit those horses of power, and there will be swinging of clubs and thunder of hoofs, and the earth will be swept clean from the enemies of God and the Tzar  So my grandfather used to say, and he was as much older than I as I am older than you, little ones, and so he should know  Well, one day long ago, in the green time of the year, the young archer rode through the forest on his horse of power  The trees were green; there were little blue flowers on the ground under the trees; the squirrels ran in the branches, and the hares in the undergrowth; but no birds sang  The young archer rode along the forest path and listened for the singing of the birds, but there was no singing  The forest was silent, and the only noises in it were the scratching of four-footed beasts, the dropping of fir cones, and the heavy stamping of the horse of power in the soft path  "What has come to the birds?" said the young archer  He had scarcely said this before he saw a big curving feather lying in the path before him', " The feather was larger than a swan's, larger than an eagle's", ' It lay in the path, glittering like a flame; for the sun was on it, and it was a feather of pure gold  Then he knew why there was no singing in the forest  For he knew that the fire-bird had flown that way, and that the feather in the path before him was a feather from its burning breast  The horse of power spoke and said,-- "Leave the golden feather where it lies  If you take it you will be sorry for it, and know the meaning of fear " But the brave young archer sat on the horse of power and looked at the golden feather, and wondered whether to take it or not  He had no wish to learn what it was to be afraid, but he thought, "If I take it and bring it to the Tzar my master, he will be pleased; and he will not send me away with empty hands, for no Tzar in the world has a feather from the burning breast of the fire-bird " And the more he thought, the more he wanted to carry the feather to the Tzar  And in the end he did not listen to the words of the horse of power  He leapt from the saddle, picked up the golden feather of the fire-bird, mounted his horse again, and galloped back through the green forest till he came to the palace of the Tzar  He went into the palace, and bowed before the Tzar and said,-- "O Tzar, I have brought you a feather of the fire-bird " The Tzar looked gladly at the feather, and then at the young archer  "Thank you," says he; "but if you have brought me a feather of the fire-bird, you will be able to bring me the bird itself  I should like to see it  A feather is not a fit gift to bring to the Tzar  Bring the bird itself, or, I swear by my sword, your head shall no longer sit between your shoulders!" The young archer bowed his head and went out  Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree  The place he had was a very good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as firs  But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree  He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries  The children often came with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on a straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, "Oh, how pretty he is! What a nice little fir!" But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear  At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year he was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tell by the shoots how many years old they are  "Oh! Were I but such a high tree as the others are," sighed he  "Then I should be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to look into the wide world! Then would the birds build nests among my branches: and when there was a breeze, I could bend with as much stateliness as the others!" Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morning and evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure  In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would often come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree  Oh, that made him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the Tree was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it  "To grow and grow, to get older and be tall," thought the Tree--"that, after all, is the most delightful thing in the world!" In autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees  This happened every year; and the young Fir Tree, that had now grown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be recognised; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged them out of the wood  Where did they go to? What became of them? In spring, when the swallows and the storks came, the Tree asked them, "Don\'t you know where they have been taken? Have you not met them anywhere?" The swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked musing, nodded his head, and said, "Yes; I think I know; I met many ships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent masts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir  I may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most majestically!" "Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea! But how does the sea look in reality? What is it like?" "That would take a long time to explain," said the Stork, and with these words off he went  "Rejoice in thy growth!" said the Sunbeams  "Rejoice in thy vigorous growth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!" And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the Fir understood it not  When Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down: trees which often were not even as large or of the same age as this Fir Tree, who could never rest, but always wanted to be off  These young trees, and they were always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid on carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood  "Where are they going to?" asked the Fir  "They are not taller than I; there was one indeed that was considerably shorter; and why do they retain all their branches? Whither are they taken?" "We know! We know!" chirped the Sparrows  "We have peeped in at the windows in the town below! We know whither they are taken! The greatest splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them  We peeped through the windows, and saw them planted in the middle of the warm room and ornamented with the most splendid things, with gilded apples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundred lights!" "And then?" asked the Fir Tree, trembling in every bough  "And then? What happens then?" "We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful " "I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career," cried the Tree, rejoicing  "That is still better than to cross the sea! What a longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh! were I but already on the cart! Were I in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence! Yes; then something better, something still grander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me? Something better, something still grander must follow--but what? Oh, how I long, how I suffer! I do not know myself what is the matter with me!" "Rejoice in our presence!" said the Air and the Sunlight  "Rejoice in thy own fresh youth!" But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green both winter and summer  People that saw him said, "What a fine tree!" and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down  The axe struck deep into the very pith; the Tree fell to the earth with a sigh; he felt a pang--it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness, for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place where he had sprung up  He well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, anymore; perhaps not even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable  The Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with the other trees, and heard a man say, "That one is splendid! We don\'t want the others  A young Prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him, when he came to a deep open ditch  He was turning aside to avoid it, when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch  He dismounted from his horse, and stepped along in the direction the sound came from  To his astonishment he found an old woman, who begged him to help her out of the ditch  The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there', " 'My son,' answered the old woman, 'I am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight I set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning; but I lost my way in the dark, and fell into this deep ditch, where I might have remained for ever but for your kindness", "' Then the Prince said to her, 'You can hardly walk; I will put you on my horse and lead you home", " Where do you live?' 'Over there, at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance,' replied the old woman", " The Prince lifted her on to his horse, and soon they reached the hut, where the old woman got down, and turning to the Prince said, 'Just wait a moment, and I will give you something", "' And she disappeared into her hut, but returned very soon and said, 'You are a mighty Prince, but at the same time you have a kind heart, which deserves to be rewarded", " Would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife?' 'Most certainly I would,' replied the Prince", " So the old woman continued, 'The most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the Queen of the Flowers, who has been captured by a dragon", ' If you wish to marry her, you must first set her free, and this I will help you to do  I will give you this little bell: if you ring it once, the King of the Eagles will appear; if you ring it twice, the King of the Foxes will come to you; and if you ring it three times, you will see the King of the Fishes by your side  These will help you if you are in any difficulty  Now farewell, and heaven prosper your undertaking', "' She handed him the little bell, and there disappeared hut and all, as though the earth had swallowed her up", ' Then it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy, and putting the little bell carefully in his pocket, he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free, and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid  So the next morning the Prince mounted his fine horse and left his home  He had roamed round the world for a whole year, and his horse had died of exhaustion, while he himself had suffered much from want and misery, but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of  At last one day he came to a hut, in front of which sat a very old man', " The Prince asked him, 'Do you not know where the Dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the Flower Queen prisoner?' 'No, I do not,' answered the old man", " 'But if you go straight along this road for a year, you will reach a hut where my father lives, and possibly he may be able to tell you", "' The Prince thanked him for his information, and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road, and at the end of it came to the little hut, where he found a very old man", " He asked him the same question, and the old man answered, 'No, I do not know where the Dragon lives", ' But go straight along this road for another year, and you will come to a hut in which my father lives  I know he can tell you', "' And so the Prince wandered on for another year, always on the same road, and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man", " He put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson; but this time the old man answered, 'The Dragon lives up there on the mountain, and he has just begun his year of sleep", ' For one whole year he is always awake, and the next he sleeps  Once upon a time there lived an old couple who had three sons; the two elder were clever, but the third was a regular dunce  The clever sons were very fond of their mother, gave her good clothes, and always spoke pleasantly to her; but the youngest was always getting in her way, and she had no patience with him  Now, one day it was announced in the village that the King had issued a decree, offering his daughter, the Princess, in marriage to whoever should build a ship that could fly', " Immediately the two elder brothers determined to try their luck, and asked their parents' blessing", ' So the old mother smartened up their clothes, and gave them a store of provisions for their journey, not forgetting to add a bottle of brandy  When they had gone the poor Simpleton began to tease his mother to smarten him up and let him start off', " 'What would become of a dolt like you?' she answered", " 'Why, you would be eaten up by wolves", "' But the foolish youth kept repeating, 'I will go, I will go, I will go!' Seeing that she could do nothing with him, the mother gave him a crust of bread and a bottle of water, and took no further heed of him", ' So the Simpleton set off on his way  When he had gone a short distance he met a little old manikin  They greeted one another, and the manikin asked him where he was going', " 'I am off to the King's Court,' he answered", " 'He has promised to give his daughter to whoever can make a flying ship", "' 'And can you make such a ship?' 'Not I", "' 'Then why in the world are you going?' 'Can't tell,' replied the Simpleton", " 'Well, if that is the case,' said the manikin, 'sit down beside me; we can rest for a little and have something to eat", ' Give me what you have got in your satchel', "' Now, the poor Simpleton was ashamed to show what was in it", ' However, he thought it best not to make a fuss, so he opened the satchel, and could scarcely believe his own eyes, for, instead of the hard crust, he saw two beautiful fresh rolls and some cold meat', " He shared them with the manikin, who licked his lips and said: 'Now, go into that wood, and stop in front of the first tree, bow three times, and then strike the tree with your axe, fall on your knees on the ground, with your face on the earth, and remain there till you are raised up", " You will then find a ship at your side, step into it and fly to the King's Palace", ' If you meet anyone on the way, take him with you', "' The Simpleton thanked the manikin very kindly, bade him farewell, and went into the road", ' When he got to the first tree he stopped in front of it, did everything just as he had been told, and, kneeling on the ground with his face to the earth, fell asleep  After a little time he was aroused; he awoke and, rubbing his eyes, saw a ready-made ship at his side, and at once got into it  And the ship rose and rose, and in another minute was flying through the air, when the Simpleton, who was on the look out, cast his eyes down to the earth and saw a man beneath him on the road, who was kneeling with his ear upon the damp ground', " 'Hallo!' he called out, 'what are you doing down there?' 'I am listening to what is going on in the world,' replied the man", " 'Come with me in my ship,' said the Simpleton", ' So the man was only too glad, and got in beside him; and the ship flew, and flew, and flew through the air, till again from his outlook the Simpleton saw a man on the road below, who was hopping on one leg, while his other leg was tied up behind his ear  There was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street, and perhaps even a little side-street besides, with silver  But he did not do that; he knew another way of spending his money  If he spent a shilling he got back a florin-such an excellent merchant he was till he died  Now his son inherited all this money  He lived very merrily; he went every night to the theatre, made paper kites out of five-pound notes, and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones  In this way the money was likely to come soon to an end, and so it did  At last he had nothing left but four shillings, and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown  His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him; they would not even walk down the street with him  But one of them who was rather good-natured sent him an old trunk with the message, \'Pack up!" That was all very well, but he had nothing to pack up, so he got into the trunk himself  It was an enchanted trunk, for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly  He pressed it, and away he flew in it up the chimney, high into the clouds, further and further away  But whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces, for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault-just think of it! In this way he arrived at the land of the Turks  He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves, and then walked into the town  He could do that quite well, for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers  He met a nurse with a little child', " 'Halloa! you Turkish nurse,' said he, 'what is that great castle there close to the town? The one with the windows so high up?' 'The sultan's daughter lives there,' she replied", " 'It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband, and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by", "' 'Thank you,' said the merchant's son, and he went into the wood, sat himself in his trunk, flew on to the roof, and crept through the window into the princess's room", ' She was lying on the sofa asleep, and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her  Then she woke up and was very much frightened, but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her, and that pleased her very much  They sat close to each other, and he told her a story about her eyes  They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids  And her forehead was a snowy mountain, grand and shining  These were lovely stories  Then he asked the princess to marry him, and she said yes at once', " 'But you must come here on Saturday,' she said, 'for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me", ' They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks  But mind you have a really good story ready, for my parents like them immensely  My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown, and my father likes something merry to make him laugh', "' 'Yes, I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry,' said he, and so they parted" ,  ' Once a weaver, who was in want of work, took service with a certain farmer as a shepherd  The farmer, knowing that the man was very slow-witted, gave him most careful instructions as to everything that he was to do', " Finally he said: 'If a wolf or any wild animal attempts to hurt the flock you should pick up a big stone like this' (suiting the action to the word) 'and throw a few such at him, and he will be afraid and go away", "' The weaver said that he understood, and started with the flocks to the hillsides where they grazed all day", ' By chance in the afternoon a leopard appeared, and the weaver instantly ran home as fast as he could to get the stones which the farmer had shown him, to throw at the creature  When he came back all the flock were scattered or killed, and when the farmer heard the tale he beat him soundly', " 'Were there no stones on the hillside that you should run back to get them, you senseless one?' he cried; 'you are not fit to herd sheep", " To-day you shall stay at home and mind my old mother who is sick, perhaps you will be able to drive flies off her face, if you can't drive beasts away from sheep!' So, the next day, the weaver was left at home to take care of the farmer's old sick mother", ' Now as she lay outside on a bed, it turned out that the flies became very troublesome, and the weaver looked round for something to drive them away with; and as he had been told to pick up the nearest stone to drive the beasts away from the flock, he thought he would this time show how cleverly he could obey orders  Accordingly he seized the nearest stone, which was a big, heavy one, and dashed it at the flies; but, unhappily, he slew the poor old woman also; and then, being afraid of the wrath of the farmer, he fled and was not seen again in that neighbourhood  All that day and all the next night he walked, and at length he came to a village where a great many weavers lived together', " 'You are welcome,' said they", " 'Eat and sleep, for to-morrow six of us start in search of fresh wool to weave, and we pray you to give us your company", "' 'Willingly,' answered the weaver", ' So the next morning the seven weavers set out to go to the village where they could buy what they wanted  On the way they had to cross a ravine which lately had been full of water, but now was quite dry  The weavers, however, were accustomed to swim over this ravine; therefore, regardless of the fact that this time it was dry, they stripped, and, tying their clothes on their heads, they proceeded to swim across the dry sand and rocks that formed the bed of the ravine  Thus they got to the other side without further damage than bruised knees and elbows, and as soon as they were over, one of them began to count the party to make sure that all were safe there  He counted all except himself, and then cried out that somebody was missing! This set each of them counting; but each made the same mistake of counting all except himself, so that they became certain that one of their party was missing! They ran up and down the bank of the ravine wringing their hands in great distress and looking for signs of their lost comrade  There a farmer found them and asked what was the matter', " 'Alas!' said one, 'seven of us started from the other bank and one must have been drowned on the crossing, as we can only find six remaining!' The farmer eyed them a minute, and then, picking up his stick, he dealt each a sounding blow, counting, as he did so, 'One! two! three!' and so on up to the seven", ' When the weavers found that there were seven of them they were overcome with gratitude to one whom they took for a magician as he could thus make seven out of an obvious six     There were once upon a time an old peasant and his wife, and they had three sons  Two of them were clever young men who could borrow money without being cheated, but the third was the Fool of the World  He was as simple as a child, simpler than some children, and he never did any one a harm in his life  Well, it always happens like that  The father and mother thought a lot of the two smart young men; but the Fool of the World was lucky if he got enough to eat, because they always forgot him unless they happened to be looking at him, and sometimes even then  But however it was with his father and mother, this is a story that shows that God loves simple folk, and turns things to their advantage in the end  For it happened that the Tzar of that country sent out messengers along the highroads and the rivers, even to huts in the forest like ours, to say that he would give his daughter, the Princess, in marriage to any one who could bring him a flying ship--ay, a ship with wings, that should sail this way and that through the blue sky, like a ship sailing on the sea  "This is a chance for us," said the two clever brothers; and that same day they set off together, to see if one of them could not build the flying ship and marry the Tzar\'s daughter, and so be a great man indeed  And their father blessed them, and gave them finer clothes than ever he wore himself  And their mother made them up hampers of food for the road, soft white rolls, and several kinds of cooked meats, and bottles of corn brandy  She went with them as far as the highroad, and waved her hand to them till they were out of sight  And so the two clever brothers set merrily off on their adventure, to see what could be done with their cleverness  And what happened to them I do not know, for they were never heard of again  The Fool of the World saw them set off, with their fine parcels of food, and their fine clothes, and their bottles of corn brandy  "I\'d like to go too," says he, "and eat good meat, with soft white rolls, and drink corn brandy, and marry the Tzar\'s daughter " "Stupid fellow," says his mother, "what\'s the good of your going? Why, if you were to stir from the house you would walk into the arms of a bear; and if not that, then the wolves would eat you before you had finished staring at them " But the Fool of the World would not be held back by words  "I am going," says he  "I am going  I am going  I am going " He went on saying this over and over again, till the old woman his mother saw there was nothing to be done, and was glad to get him out of the house so as to be quit of the sound of his voice  So she put some food in a bag for him to eat by the way  She put in the bag some crusts of dry black bread and a flask of water  She did not even bother to go as far as the footpath to see him on his way  She saw the last of him at the door of the hut, and he had not taken two steps before she had gone back into the hut to see to more important business  No matter', " The Fool of the World set off with his bag over his shoulder, singing as he went, for he was off to seek his fortune and marry the Tzar's daughter", ' He was sorry his mother had not given him any corn brandy; but he sang merrily for all that  He would have liked white rolls instead of the dry black crusts; but, after all, the main thing on a journey is to have something to eat  In the old land of Brittany, once called Cornwall, there lived a woman named Barbaik Bourhis, who spent all her days in looking after her farm with the help of her niece Tephany  Early and late the two might be seen in the fields or in the dairy, milking cows, making butter, feeding fowls; working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too  Perhaps it might have been better for Barbaik if she had left herself a little time to rest and to think about other things, for soon she grew to love money for its own sake, and only gave herself and Tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed  And as for poor people she positively hated them, and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world  Well, this being the sort of person Barbaik was, it is easy to guess at her anger when one day she found Tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young Denis, who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of Plover', " Seizing her niece by the arm, she pulled her sharply away, exclaiming: 'Are you not ashamed, girl, to waste your time over a man who is as poor as a rat, when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy you rings of silver, if you would let them?' 'Denis is a good workman, as you know very well,' answered Tephany, red with anger, 'and he puts by money too, and soon he will be able to take a farm for himself", "' 'Nonsense,' cried Barbaik, 'he will never save enough for a farm till he is a hundred", ' I would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man who carries his whole fortune on his back', "' 'What does fortune matter when one is young and strong?' asked Tephany, but her aunt, amazed at such words, would hardly let her finish", " 'What does fortune matter?' repeated Barbaik, in a shocked voice", " 'Is it possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money? If this is what you learn from Denis, I forbid you to speak to him, and I will have him turned out of the farm if he dares to show his face here again", ' Now go and wash the clothes and spread them out to dry', "' Tephany did not dare to disobey, but with a heavy heart went down the path to the river", " 'She is harder than these rocks,' said the girl to herself, 'yes, a thousand times harder", ' For the rain at least can at last wear away the stone, but you might cry for ever, and she would never care  Talking to Denis is the only pleasure I have, and if I am not to see him I may as well enter a convent', "' Thinking these thoughts she reached the bank, and began to unfold the large packet of linen that had to be washed", ' The tap of a stick made her look up, and standing before her she saw a little old woman, whose face was strange to her', " 'You would like to sit down and rest, granny?' asked Tephany, pushing aside her bundle", " 'When the sky is all the roof you have, you rest where you will,' replied the old woman in trembling tones", " 'Are you so lonely, then?' inquired Tephany, full of pity", " 'Have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses?' The old woman shook her head", " 'They all died long, long ago,' she answered, 'and the only friends I have are strangers with kind hearts", "' The girl did not speak for a moment, then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner", " 'Take this,' she said; 'to-day at any rate you shall dine well,' and the old woman took it, gazing at Tephany the while", " 'Those who help others deserve to be helped,' she answered; 'your eyes are still red because that miser Barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from Plover", ' But cheer up, you are a good girl, and I will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day', "' 'You?' cried Tephany, stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs, but the old woman did not hear her", " 'Take this long copper pin,' she went on, 'and every time you stick it in your dress Mother Bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages", ' As long as the pin is in your dress you will be free, and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again  Once upon a time a fox lay peeping out of his hole, watching the road that ran by at a little distance, and hoping to see something that might amuse him, for he was feeling very dull and rather cross  For a long while he watched in vain; everything seemed asleep, and not even a bird stirred overhead  The fox grew crosser than ever, and he was just turning away in disgust from his place when he heard the sound of feet coming over the snow', " He crouched eagerly down at the edge of the road and said to himself: 'I wonder what would happen if I were to pretend to be dead! This is a man driving a reindeer sledge, I know the tinkling of the harness", " And at any rate I shall have an adventure, and that is always something!' So he stretched himself out by the side of the road, carefully choosing a spot where the driver could not help seeing him, yet where the reindeer would not tread on him; and all fell out just as he had expected", ' The sledge-driver pulled up sharply, as his eyes lighted on the beautiful animal lying stiffly beside him, and jumping out he threw the fox into the bottom of the sledge, where the goods he was carrying were bound tightly together by ropes  The fox did not move a muscle though his bones were sore from the fall, and the driver got back to his seat again and drove on merrily  But before they had gone very far, the fox, who was near the edge, contrived to slip over, and when the Laplander saw him stretched out on the snow he pulled up his reindeer and put the fox into one of the other sledges that was fastened behind, for it was market-day at the nearest town, and the man had much to sell  They drove on a little further, when some noise in the forest made the man turn his head, just in time to see the fox fall with a heavy thump on to the frozen snow', " 'That beast is bewitched!' he said to himself, and then he threw the fox into the last sledge of all, which had a cargo of fishes", ' This was exactly what the cunning creature wanted, and he wriggled gently to the front and bit the cord which tied the sledge to the one before it so that it remained standing in the middle of the road  Now there were so many sledges that the Lapp did not notice for a long while that one was missing; indeed, he would have entered the town without knowing if snow had not suddenly begun to fall  Then he got down to secure more firmly the cloths that kept his goods dry, and going to the end of the long row, discovered that the sledge containing the fish and the fox was missing  He quickly unharnessed one of his reindeer and rode back along the way he had come, to find the sledge standing safe in the middle of the road; but as the fox had bitten off the cord close to the noose there was no means of moving it away  The fox meanwhile was enjoying himself mightily  As soon as he had loosened the sledge, he had taken his favourite fish from among the piles neatly arranged for sale, and had trotted off to the forest with it in his mouth', " By-and-by he met a bear, who stopped and said: 'Where did you find that fish, Mr", " Fox?' 'Oh, not far off,' answered he; 'I just stuck my tail in the stream close by the place where the elves dwell, and the fish hung on to it of itself", "' 'Dear me,' snarled the bear, who was hungry and not in a good temper, 'if the fish hung on to your tail, I suppose he will hang on to mine", "' 'Yes, certainly, grandfather,' replied the fox, 'if you have patience to suffer what I suffered", "' 'Of course I can,' replied the bear, 'what nonsense you talk! Show me the way", "' So the fox led him to the bank of a stream, which, being in a warm place, had only lightly frozen in places, and was at this moment glittering in the spring sunshine", " 'The elves bathe here,' he said, 'and if you put in your tail the fish will catch hold of it", ' But it is no use being in a hurry, or you will spoil everything', "' Then he trotted off, but only went out of sight of the bear, who stood still on the bank with his tail deep in the water", " Soon the sun set and it grew very cold and the ice formed rapidly, and the bear's tail was fixed as tight as if a vice had held it; and when the fox saw that everything had happened just as he had planned it, he called out loudly: 'Be quick, good people, and come with your bows and spears", " A bear has been fishing in your brook!' And in a moment the whole place was full of little creatures each one with a tiny bow and a spear hardly big enough for a baby; but both arrows and spears could sting, as the bear knew very well, and in his fright he gave such a tug to his tail that it broke short off, and he rolled away into the forest as fast as his legs could carry him", ' At this sight the fox held his sides for laughing, and then scampered away in another direction  By-and-by he came to a fir tree, and crept into a hole under the root  After that he did something very strange  At the foot of some high mountains there was, once upon a time, a small village, and a little way off two roads met, one of them going to the east and the other to the west  The villagers were quiet, hard-working folk, who toiled in the fields all day, and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church  In the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture, and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset  One summer night, when a round full moon shone down upon the white road, a great wolf came trotting round the corner', " 'I positively must get a good meal before I go back to my den,' he said to himself; 'it is nearly a week since I have tasted anything but scraps, though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure! Of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains; but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them, and I am not so young as I was! If I could only dine off that fox I saw a fortnight ago, curled up into a delicious hairy ball, I should ask nothing better; I would have eaten her then, but unluckily her husband was lying beside her, and one knows that foxes, great and small, run like the wind", ' Really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf, and, as the proverb says: "One wolf does not bite another " However, let us see what this village can produce  I am as hungry as a schoolmaster', "' Now, while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf, the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road", " 'The whole of this day I have listened to those village hens clucking till I could bear it no longer,' murmured she as she bounded along, hardly seeming to touch the ground", " 'When you are fond of fowls and eggs it is the sweetest of all music", ' As sure as there is a sun in heaven I will have some of them this night, for I have grown so thin that my very bones rattle, and my poor babies are crying for food', "' And as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass, where the two roads joined, and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest, and to settle her plans", ' At this moment the wolf came up  At the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water, but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was', " The fox's quick ears heard the sound of his paws, though they were soft as velvet, and turning her head she said politely: 'Is that you, neighbour? What a strange place to meet in! I hope you are quite well?' 'Quite well as regards my health,' answered the wolf, whose eye glistened greedily, 'at least, as well as one can be when one is very hungry", " But what is the matter with you? A fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish!' 'I have been ill--very ill,' replied the fox, 'and what you say is quite true", ' A worm is fat in comparison with me', "' 'He is", ' Still, you are good enough for me; for "to the hungry no bread is hard "\' \'Oh, you are always joking! I\'m sure you are not half as hungry as I!\' \'That we shall soon see,\' cried the wolf, opening his huge mouth and crouching for a spring', " 'What are you doing?' exclaimed the fox, stepping backwards", " 'What am I doing? What I am going to do is to make my supper off you, in less time than a cock takes to crow", "' 'Well, I suppose you must have your joke,' answered the fox lightly, but never removing her eye from the wolf, who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth: 'I don't want to joke, but to eat!' 'But surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all!' 'In this world the cleverest people are always the hungriest,' replied the wolf", ' \'Ah! how true that is; but--\' \'I can\'t stop to listen to your "buts" and "yets,"\' broke in the wolf rudely; \'let us get to the point, and the point is that I want to eat you and not talk to you', "' 'Have you no pity for a poor mother?' asked the fox, putting her tail to her eyes, but peeping slily out of them all the same", " 'I am dying of hunger,' answered the wolf, doggedly; 'and you know,' he added with a grin, 'that charity begins at home", "' 'Quite so,' replied the fox; 'it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense", ' But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request', "' 'Then be quick and don't waste my time, for I can't wait much longer" ,  ' Once upon a time there was a woman who had three sons  Though they were peasants they were well off, for the soil on which they lived was fruitful, and yielded rich crops  One day they all three told their mother they meant to get married', " To which their mother replied: 'Do as you like, but see that you choose good housewives, who will look carefully after your affairs; and, to make certain of this, take with you these three skeins of flax, and give it to them to spin", ' Whoever spins the best will be my favourite daughter-in-law', "' Now the two eldest sons had already chosen their wives; so they took the flax from their mother, and carried it off with them, to have it spun as she had said", ' But the youngest son was puzzled what to do with his skein, as he knew no girl (never having spoken to any) to whom he could give it to be spun  He wandered hither and thither, asking the girls that he met if they would undertake the task for him, but at the sight of the flax they laughed in his face and mocked at him  Then in despair he left their villages, and went out into the country, and, seating himself on the bank of a pond began to cry bitterly  Suddenly there was a noise close beside him, and a frog jumped out of the water on to the bank and asked him why he was crying  The youth told her of his trouble, and how his brothers would bring home linen spun for them by their promised wives, but that no one would spin his thread', " Then the frog answered: 'Do not weep on that account; give me the thread, and I will spin it for you", "' And, having said this, she took it out of his hand, and flopped back into the water, and the youth went back, not knowing what would happen next", ' In a short time the two elder brothers came home, and their mother asked to see the linen which had been woven out of the skeins of flax she had given them  They all three left the room; and in a few minutes the two eldest returned, bringing with them the linen that had been spun by their chosen wives  But the youngest brother was greatly troubled, for he had nothing to show for the skein of flax that had been given to him  Sadly he betook himself to the pond, and sitting down on the bank, began to weep  Flop! and the frog appeared out of the water close beside him', " 'Take this,' she said; 'here is the linen that I have spun for you", "' You may imagine how delighted the youth was", ' She put the linen into his hands, and he took it straight back to his mother, who was so pleased with it that she declared she had never seen linen so beautifully spun, and that it was far finer and whiter than the webs that the two elder brothers had brought home', " Then she turned to her sons and said: 'But this is not enough, my sons, I must have another proof as to what sort of wives you have chosen", ' In the house there are three puppies  Each of you take one, and give it to the woman whom you mean to bring home as your wife  She must train it and bring it up  Whichever dog turns out the best, its mistress will be my favourite daughter-in-law', "' So the young men set out on their different ways, each taking a puppy with him", ' The youngest, not knowing where to go, returned to the pond, sat down once more on the bank, and began to weep  Flop! and close beside him, he saw the frog', " 'Why are you weeping?' she said" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a king who was always at war with his neighbours, which was very strange, as he was a good and kind man, quite content with his own country, and not wanting to seize land belonging to other people  Perhaps he may have tried too much to please everybody, and that often ends in pleasing nobody; but, at any rate, he found himself, at the end of a hard struggle, defeated in battle, and obliged to fall back behind the walls of his capital city  Once there, he began to make preparations for a long siege, and the first thing he did was to plan how best to send his wife to a place of security  The queen, who loved her husband dearly, would gladly have remained with him to share his dangers, but he would not allow it  So they parted, with many tears, and the queen set out with a strong guard to a fortified castle on the outskirts of a great forest, some two hundred miles distant  She cried nearly all the way, and when she arrived she cried still more, for everything in the castle was dusty and old, and outside there was only a gravelled courtyard, and the king had forbidden her to go beyond the walls without at least two soldiers to take care of her  Now the queen had only been married a few months, and in her own home she had been used to walk and ride all over the hills without any attendants at all; so she felt very dull at her being shut up in this way', " However, she bore it for a long while because it was the king's wish, but when time passed and there were no signs of the war drifting in the direction of the castle, she grew bolder, and sometimes strayed outside the walls, in the direction of the forest", ' Then came a dreadful period, when news from the king ceased entirely', " 'He must surely be ill or dead,' thought the poor girl, who even now was only sixteen", " 'I can bear it no longer, and if I do not get a letter from him soon I shall leave this horrible place and go back to see what is the matter", " Oh! I do wish I had never come away!' So, without telling anyone what she intended to do, she ordered a little low carriage to be built, something like a sledge, only it was on two wheels--just big enough to hold one person", " 'I am tired of being always in the castle,' she said to her attendants; 'and I mean to hunt a little", " Quite close by, of course,' she added, seeing the anxious look on their faces", " 'And there is no reason that you should not hunt too", "' All the faces brightened at that, for, to tell the truth, they were nearly as dull as their mistress; so the queen had her way, and two beautiful horses were brought from the stable to draw the little chariot", ' At first the queen took care to keep near the rest of the hunt, but gradually she stayed away longer and longer, and at last, one morning, she took advantage of the appearance of a wild boar, after which her whole court instantly galloped, to turn into a path in the opposite direction', " Unluckily, it did not happen to lead towards the king's palace, where she intended to go, but she was so afraid her flight would be noticed that she whipped up her horses till they ran away", ' When she understood what was happening the poor young queen was terribly frightened, and, dropping the reins, clung to the side of the chariot  The horses, thus left without any control, dashed blindly against a tree, and the queen was flung out on the ground, where she lay for some minutes unconscious', " A rustling sound near her at length caused her to open her eyes; before her stood a huge woman, almost a giantess, without any clothes save a lion's skin, which was thrown over her shoulders, while a dried snake's skin was plaited into her hair", ' In one hand she held a club on which she leaned, and in the other a quiver full of arrows  At the sight of this strange figure the queen thought she must be dead, and gazing on an inhabitant of another world', " So she murmured softly to herself: 'I am not surprised that people are so loth to die when they know that they will see such horrible creatures", "' But, low as she spoke, the giantess caught the words, and began to laugh", " 'Oh, don't be afraid; you are still alive, and perhaps, after all, you may be sorry for it", ' I am the Lion Fairy, and you are going to spend the rest of your days with me in my palace, which is quite near this  So come along', "' But the queen shrank back in horror", " 'Oh, Madam Lion, take me back, I pray you, to my castle; and fix what ransom you like, for my husband will pay it, whatever it is" ,  ' In the olden time, when wishing was having, there lived a King, whose daughters were all beautiful; but the youngest was so exceedingly beautiful that the Sun himself, although he saw her very, very often, was delighted every time she came out into the sunshine', " Near the castle of this King was a large and gloomy forest, where in the midst stood an old lime-tree, beneath whose branches splashed a little fountain; so, whenever it was very hot, the King's youngest daughter ran off into this wood, and sat down by the side of the fountain; and, when she felt dull, would often divert herself by throwing a golden ball up into the air and catching it again", ' And this was her favorite amusement', " Now, one day it happened that this golden ball, when the King's daughter threw it into the air, did not fall down into her hand, but on to the grass; and then it rolled right into the fountain", " The King's daughter followed the ball with her eyes, but it disappeared beneath the water, which was so deep that she could not see to the bottom", ' Then she began to lament, and to cry more loudly and more loudly; and, as she cried, a voice called out, "Why weepest thou, O King\'s daughter? thy tears would melt even a stone to pity " She looked around to the spot whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching his thick, ugly head out of the water  "Ah! you old water-paddler," said she, "was it you that spoke? I am weeping for my golden ball which bounced away from me into the water " "Be quiet, and do not cry," replied the Frog; "I can give thee good assistance  But what wilt thou give me if I succeed in fetching thy plaything up again?" "What would you like, dear Frog?" said she  "My dresses, my pearls and jewels, or the golden crown which I wear?" The Frog replied, "Dresses, or jewels, or golden crowns, are not for me; but if thou wilt love me, and let me be thy companion and playmate, and sit at thy table, and eat from thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed,--if thou wilt promise me all these things, then I will dive down and fetch up thy golden ball " "Oh, I will promise you all," said she, "if you will only get me my golden ball " But she thought to herself, "What is the silly Frog chattering about? Let him stay in the water with his equals; he cannot enter into society " Then the Frog, as soon as he had received her promise, drew his head under the water and dived down  Presently he swam up again with the golden ball in his mouth, and threw it on to the grass', " The King's daughter was full of joy when she again saw her beautiful plaything; and, taking it up, she ran off immediately", ' "Stop! stop!" cried the Frog; "take me with thee  I cannot run as thou canst " But this croaking was of no avail; although it was loud enough, the King\'s daughter did not hear it, but, hastening home, soon forgot the poor Frog, who was obliged to leap back into the fountain  The next day, when the King\'s daughter was sitting at table with her father and all his courtiers, and was eating from her own little golden plate, something was heard coming up the marble stairs, splish-splash, splish-splash; and when it arrived at the top, it knocked at the door, and a voice said-- "Open the door, thou youngest daughter of the King!" So she arose and went to see who it was that called to her; but when she opened the door and caught sight of the Frog, she shut it again very quickly and with great passion, and sat down at the table, looking exceedingly pale  But the King perceived that her heart was beating violently, and asked her whether it were a giant who had come to fetch her away who stood at the door  "Oh, no!" answered she; "it is no giant, but an ugly Frog " "What does the Frog want with you?" said the King  "Oh, dear father, yesterday when I was playing by the fountain, my golden ball fell into the water, and this Frog fetched it up again because I cried so much: but first, I must tell you, he pressed me so much, that I promised him he should be my companion  I never thought that he could come out of the water, but somehow he has managed to jump out, and now he wants to come in here " At that moment there was another knock, and a voice said--  "King\'s daughter, youngest,   Open the door', "  Hast thou forgotten   Thy promises made  At the fountain so clear   'Neath the lime-tree's shade?  King's daughter, youngest", '   Open the door " Then the King said, "What you have promised, that you must perform; go and let him in " So the King\'s daughter went and opened the door, and the Frog hopped in after her right up to her chair: and as soon as she was seated, he said, "Lift me up;" but she hesitated so long that the King had to order her to obey  Just before the world was drowned all the animals gathered in front of the Ark and Father Noah carefully inspected them  "All ye that lie down shall enter and be saved from the deluge that is about to destroy the world," he said  "Ye that stand cannot enter " Then the various creatures began to march forward into the Ark  Father Noah watched them closely  He seemed troubled  "I wonder," he said to himself, "how I shall obtain a unicorn, and how I shall get it into the Ark " "I can bring thee a unicorn, Father Noah," he heard in a voice of thunder, and turning round he saw the giant, Og  "But thou must agree to save me, too, from the flood " "Begone," cried Noah  "Thou art a demon, not a human being  I can have no dealings with thee " "Pity me," whined the giant  "See how my figure is shrinking  Once I was so tall that I could drink water from the clouds and toast fish at the sun  I fear not that I shall be drowned, but that all the food will be destroyed and that I shall perish of hunger " Noah, however, only smiled; but he grew serious again when Og brought a unicorn  It was as big as a mountain, although the giant said it was the smallest he could find  It lay down in front of the Ark and Noah saw by that action that he must save it  For some time he was puzzled what to do, but at last a bright idea struck him  He attached the huge beast to the Ark by a rope fastened to its horn so that it could swim alongside and be fed  Og seated himself on a mountain near at hand and watched the rain pouring down  Faster and faster it fell in torrents until the rivers overflowed and the waters began to rise rapidly on the land and sweep all things away  Father Noah stood gloomily before the door of the Ark until the water reached his neck  Then it swept him inside  The door closed with a bang, and the Ark rose gallantly on the flood and began to move along  The unicorn swam alongside, and as it passed Og, the giant jumped on to its back  "See, Father Noah," he cried, with a huge chuckle, "you will have to save me after all  I will snatch all the food you put through the window for the unicorn " Noah saw that it was useless to argue with Og, who might, indeed, sink the Ark with his tremendous strength  There was once upon a time a poor boy who had neither father nor mother  In order to gain a living he looked after the sheep of a great Lord  Day and night he spent out in the open fields, and only when it was very wet and stormy did he take refuge in a little hut on the edge of a big forest  Now one night, when he was sitting on the grass beside his flocks, he heard not very far from him the sound as of some one crying  He rose up and followed the direction of the noise', " To his dismay and astonishment he found a Giant lying at the entrance of the wood; he was about to run off as fast as his legs could carry him, when the Giant called out: 'Don't be afraid, I won't harm you", ' On the contrary, I will reward you handsomely if you will bind up my foot  I hurt it when I was trying to root up an oak-tree', "' The Herd-boy took off his shirt, and bound up the Giant's wounded foot with it", " Then the Giant rose up and said, 'Now come and I will reward you", ' We are going to celebrate a marriage to-day, and I promise you we shall have plenty of fun', " Come and enjoy yourself, but in order that my brothers mayn't see you, put this band round your waist and then you'll be invisible", "' With these words he handed the Herd-boy a belt, and walking on in front he led him to a fountain where hundreds of Giants and Giantesses were assembled preparing to hold a wedding", ' They danced and played different games till midnight; then one of the Giants tore up a plant by its roots, and all the Giants and Giantesses made themselves so thin that they disappeared into the earth through the hole made by the uprooting of the plant', " The wounded Giant remained behind to the last and called out, 'Herd-boy, where are you?' 'Here I am, close to you,' was the reply", " 'Touch me,' said the Giant, 'so that you too may come with us under ground", "' The Herd-boy did as he was told, and before he could have believed it possible he found himself in a big hall, where even the walls were made of pure gold", ' Then to his astonishment he saw that the hall was furnished with the tables and chairs that belonged to his master  In a few minutes the company began to eat and drink  The banquet was a very gorgeous one, and the poor youth fell to and ate and drank lustily', " When he had eaten and drunk as much as he could he thought to himself, 'Why shouldn't I put a loaf of bread in my pocket? I shall be glad of it to-morrow", "' So he seized a loaf when no one was looking and stowed it away under his tunic", " No sooner had he done so than the wounded Giant limped up to him and whispered softly, 'Herd-boy, where are you?' 'Here I am,' replied the youth", " 'Then hold on to me,' said the Giant, 'so that I may lead you up above again", "' So the Herd-boy held on to the Giant, and in a few moments he found himself on the earth once more, but the Giant had vanished", ' The Herd-boy returned to his sheep, and took off the invisible belt which he hid carefully in his bag', " The next morning the lad felt hungry, and thought he would cut off a piece of the loaf he had carried away from the Giants' wedding feast, and eat it", " But although he tried with all his might, he couldn't cut off the smallest piece", ' Then in despair he bit the loaf, and what was his astonishment when a piece of gold fell out of his mouth and rolled at his feet  He bit the bread a second and third time, and each time a piece of gold fell out of his mouth; but the bread remained untouched   Now, all the night around their echoing camp  Was heard continuous from the hills a sound as of the tramp  Of giant footsteps; but, so thick the white mist lay around,  None saw the Walker, save the King', " He, starting at the sound,  Called to his foot his fierce red hound; athwart his shoulders cast  A shaggy mantle, grasped his spear, and through the moonlight passed  Alone up dark Ben-Boli's heights, towards which, above the woods,  With sound as when at close of eve the noise of falling floods  Is borne to shepherd's ear remote on stilly upland lawn,  The steps along the mountain-side with hollow fall came on", "  Fast beat the hero's heart; and close down-crouching by his knee  Trembled the hound, while, through the haze, huge as through mists at    sea,  The week-long sleepless mariner descries some mountain cape,  Wreck-infamous, rise on his lee, appeared a monstrous Shape,  Striding impatient, like a man much grieved, who walks alone,  Considering of a cruel wrong; down from his shoulders thrown  A mantle, skirted stiff with soil splashed from the miry ground,  At every stride against his calves struck with as loud rebound  As makes the main-sail of a ship brought up along the blast,  When with the coil of all its ropes it beats the sounding mast", '  So, striding vast, the giant passed; the King held fast his breath--  Motionless, save his throbbing heart; and chill and still as death  Stood listening while, a second time, the giant took the round  Of all the camp; but, when at length, for the third time, the sound  Came up, and through the parting haze a third time huge and dim  Rose out the Shape, the valiant hound sprang forth and challenged him   And forth, disdaining that a dog should put him so to shame,  Sprang Congal, and essayed to speak: "Dread Shadow, stand! Proclaim  What wouldst thou that thou thus all night around my camp shouldst keep  Thy troublous vigil banishing the wholesome gift of sleep  From all our eyes, who, though inured to dreadful sounds and sights  By land and sea, have never yet, in all our perilous nights,  Lain in the ward of such a guard "                 The Shape made answer none,  But with stern wafture of its hand went angrier striding on,  Shaking the earth with heavier steps  Then Congal on his track  Sprang fearless    "Answer me, thou churl!" he cried, "I bid thee back!"  But while he spoke, the giant\'s cloak around his shoulders grew  Like to a black-bulged thunder-cloud, and sudden, out there flew  From all its angry swelling folds, with uproar unconfined,  Direct against the King\'s pursuit, a mighty blast of wind', "  Loud flapped the mantle, tempest-lined, while, fluttering down the gale,  As leaves in autumn, man and hound were swept into the vale;  And, heard o'er all the huge uproar, through startled Dalaray  The giant went, with stamp and clash, departing south away", '    Once upon a time there was an old man who lived in a little hut in the middle of a forest  His wife was dead, and he had only one son, whom he loved dearly', " Near their hut was a group of birch trees, in which some black-game had made their nests, and the youth had often begged his father's permission to shoot the birds, but the old man always strictly forbade him to do anything of the kind", ' One day, however, when the father had gone to a little distance to collect some sticks for the fire, the boy fetched his bow, and shot at a bird that was just flying towards its nest  But he had not taken proper aim, and the bird was only wounded, and fluttered along the ground  The boy ran to catch it, but though he ran very fast, and the bird seemed to flutter along very slowly, he never could quite come up with it; it was always just a little in advance  But so absorbed was he in the chase that he did not notice for some time that he was now deep in the forest, in a place where he had never been before  Then he felt it would be foolish to go any further, and he turned to find his way home  He thought it would be easy enough to follow the path along which he had come, but somehow it was always branching off in unexpected directions  He looked about for a house where he might stop and ask his way, but there was not a sign of one anywhere, and he was afraid to stand still, for it was cold, and there were many stories of wolves being seen in that part of the forest  Night fell, and he was beginning to start at every sound, when suddenly a magician came running towards him, with a pack of wolves snapping at his heels', " Then all the boy's courage returned to him", ' He took his bow, and aiming an arrow at the largest wolf, shot him through the heart, and a few more arrows soon put the rest to flight  The magician was full of gratitude to his deliverer, and promised him a reward for his help if the youth would go back with him to his house', " 'Indeed there is nothing that would be more welcome to me than a night's lodging,' answered the boy; 'I have been wandering all day in the forest, and did not know how to get home again", " 'Come with me, you must be hungry as well as tired,' said the magician, and led the way to his house, where the guest flung himself on a bed, and went fast asleep", ' But his host returned to the forest to get some food, for the larder was empty', " While he was absent the housekeeper went to the boy's room and tried to wake him", ' She stamped on the floor, and shook him and called to him, telling him that he was in great danger, and must take flight at once  But nothing would rouse him, and if he did ever open his eyes he shut them again directly  Soon after, the magician came back from the forest, and told the housekeeper to bring them something to eat  The meal was quickly ready, and the magician called to the boy to come down and eat it, but he could not be wakened, and they had to sit down to supper without him  By-and-by the magician went out into the wood again for some more hunting, and on his return he tried afresh to waken the youth  But finding it quite impossible, he went back for the third time to the forest  While he was absent the boy woke up and dressed himself  Then he came downstairs and began to talk to the housekeeper', " The girl had heard how he had saved her master's life, so she said nothing more about his running away, but instead told him that if the magician offered him the choice of a reward, he was to ask for the horse which stood in the third stall of the stable", ' By-and-by the old man came back and they all sat down to dinner', " When they had finished the magician said: 'Now, my son, tell me what you will have as the reward of your courage?' 'Give me the horse that stands in the third stall of your stable,' answered the youth", " 'For I have a long way to go before I get home, and my feet will not carry me so far" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived, on the bank of a stream, a man and a woman who had a daughter', " As she was an only child, and very pretty besides, they never could make up their minds to punish her for her faults or to teach her nice manners; and as for work-- she laughed in her mother's face if she asked her to help cook the dinner or to wash the plates", ' All the girl would do was to spend her days in dancing and playing with her friends; and for any use she was to her parents they might as well have no daughter at all  However, one morning her mother looked so tired that even the selfish girl could not help seeing it, and asked if there was anything she was able to do, so that her mother might rest a little  The good woman looked so surprised and grateful for this offer that the girl felt rather ashamed, and at that moment would have scrubbed down the house if she had been requested; but her mother only begged her to take the fishing-net out to the bank of the river and mend some holes in it, as her father intended to go fishing that night  The girl took the net and worked so hard that soon there was not a hole to be found  She felt quite pleased with herself, though she had had plenty to amuse her, as everybody who passed by had stopped and had a chat with her  But by this time the sun was high overhead, and she was just folding her net to carry it home again, when she heard a splash behind her, and looking round she saw a big fish jump into the air  Seizing the net with both hands, she flung it into the water where the circles were spreading one behind the other, and, more by luck than skill, drew out the fish', " 'Well, you are a beauty!' she cried to herself; but the fish looked up to her and said: 'You had better not kill me, for, if you do, I will turn you into a fish yourself!' The girl laughed contemptuously, and ran straight in to her mother", " 'Look what I have caught,' she said gaily; 'but it is almost a pity to eat it, for it can talk, and it declares that, if I kill it, it will turn me into a fish too", "' 'Oh, put it back, put it back!' implored the mother", " 'Perhaps it is skilled in magic", ' And I should die, and so would your father, if anything should happen to you', "' 'Oh, nonsense, mother; what power could a creature like that have over me? Besides, I am hungry, and if I don't have my dinner soon, I shall be cross", "' And off she went to gather some flowers to stick in her hair", ' About an hour later the blowing of a horn told her that dinner was ready', " 'Didn't I say that fish would be delicious?' she cried; and plunging her spoon into the dish the girl helped herself to a large piece", ' But the instant it touched her mouth a cold shiver ran through her  Her head seemed to flatten, and her eyes to look oddly round the corners; her legs and her arms were stuck to her sides, and she gasped wildly for breath  With a mighty bound she sprang through the window and fell into the river, where she soon felt better, and was able to swim to the sea, which was close by  No sooner had she arrived there than the sight of her sad face attracted the notice of some of the other fishes, and they pressed round her, begging her to tell them her story', " 'I am not a fish at all,' said the new-comer, swallowing a great deal of salt water as she spoke; for you cannot learn how to be a proper fish all in a moment", " 'I am not a fish at all, but a girl; at least I was a girl a few minutes ago, only--' And she ducked her head under the waves so that they should not see her crying", " 'Only you did not believe that the fish you caught had power to carry out its threat,' said an old tunny", " 'Well, never mind, that has happened to all of us, and it really is not a bad life", ' Cheer up and come with us and see our queen, who lives in a palace that is much more beautiful than any your queens can boast of', "' The new fish felt a little afraid of taking such a journey; but as she was still more afraid of being left alone, she waved her tail in token of consent, and off they all set, hundreds of them together", " The people on the rocks and in the ships that saw them pass said to each other: 'Look what a splendid shoal!' and had no idea that they were hastening to the queen's palace; but, then, dwellers on land have so little notion of what goes on in the bottom of the sea! Certainly the little new fish had none", ' She had watched jelly-fish and nautilus swimming a little way below the surface, and beautiful coloured sea-weeds floating about; but that was all  Mamma had gone down-town to shop  She had asked Nora to look after Jane Gladys, and Nora promised she would  But it was her afternoon for polishing the silver, so she stayed in the pantry and left Jane Gladys to amuse herself alone in the big sitting-room upstairs', " The little girl did not mind being alone, for she was working on her first piece of embroidery--a sofa pillow for papa's birthday present", ' So she crept into the big bay window and curled herself up on the broad sill while she bent her brown head over her work  Soon the door opened and closed again, quietly', " Jane Gladys thought it was Nora, so she didn't look up until she had taken a couple more stitches on a forget-me-not", ' Then she raised her eyes and was astonished to find a strange man in the middle of the room, who regarded her earnestly  He was short and fat, and seemed to be breathing heavily from his climb up the stairs  He held a work silk hat in one hand and underneath his other elbow was tucked a good-sized book  He was dressed in a black suit that looked old and rather shabby, and his head was bald upon the top  "Excuse me," he said, while the child gazed at him in solemn surprise  "Are you Jane Gladys Brown?" "Yes, sir," she answered  "Very good; very good, indeed!" he remarked, with a queer sort of smile  "I\'ve had quite a hunt to find you, but I\'ve succeeded at last " "How did you get in?" inquired Jane Gladys, with a growing distrust of her visitor  "That is a secret," he said, mysteriously  This was enough to put the girl on her guard  She looked at the man and the man looked at her, and both looks were grave and somewhat anxious  "What do you want?" she asked, straightening herself up with a dignified air  "Ah!--now we are coming to business," said the man, briskly  "I\'m going to be quite frank with you  To begin with, your father has abused me in a most ungentlemanly manner " Jane Gladys got off the window sill and pointed her small finger at the door  "Leave this room \'meejitly!" she cried, her voice trembling with indignation  "My papa is the best man in the world  He never \'bused anybody!" "Allow me to explain, please," said the visitor, without paying any attention to her request to go away  "Your father may be very kind to you, for you are his little girl, you know', " But when he's down-town in his office he's inclined to be rather severe, especially on book agents", ' Now, I called on him the other day and asked him to buy the \'Complete Works of Peter Smith,\' and what do you suppose he did?" She said nothing  Once upon a time there lived an emperor who was a great conqueror, and reigned over more countries than anyone in the world', " And whenever he subdued a fresh kingdom, he only granted peace on condition that the king should deliver him one of his sons for ten years' service", ' Now on the borders of his kingdom lay a country whose emperor was as brave as his neighbour, and as long as he was young he was the victor in every war  But as years passed away, his head grew weary of making plans of campaign, and his people wanted to stay at home and till their fields, and at last he too felt that he must do homage to the other emperor  One thing, however, held him back from this step which day by day he saw more clearly was the only one possible  His new overlord would demand the service of one of his sons  And the old emperor had no son; only three daughters  Look on which side he would, nothing but ruin seemed to lie before him, and he became so gloomy, that his daughters were frightened, and did everything they could think of to cheer him up, but all to no purpose', " At length one day when they were at dinner, the eldest of the three summoned up all her courage and said to her father: 'What secret grief is troubling you? Are your subjects discontented? or have we given you cause for displeasure? To smooth away your wrinkles, we would gladly shed our blood, for our lives are bound up in yours; and this you know", "' 'My daughter,' answered the emperor, 'what you say is true", " Never have you given me one moment's pain", ' Yet now you cannot help me', " Ah! why is not one of you a boy!' 'I don't understand,' she answered in surprise", " 'Tell us what is wrong: and though we are not boys, we are not quite useless!' 'But what can you do, my dear children? Spin, sew, and weave--that is all your learning", ' Only a warrior can deliver me now, a young giant who is strong to wield the battle-axe: whose sword deals deadly blows', "' 'But WHY do you need a son so much at present? Tell us all about it! It will not make matters worse if we know!' 'Listen then, my daughters, and learn the reason of my sorrow", ' You have heard that as long as I was young no man ever brought an army against me without it costing him dear  But the years have chilled my blood and drunk my strength  And now the deer can roam the forest, my arrows will never pierce his heart; strange soldiers will set fire to my houses and water their horses at my wells, and my arm cannot hinder them', " No, my day is past, and the time has come when I too must bow my head under the yoke of my foe! But who is to give him the ten years' service that is part of the price which the vanquished must pay?' '_I_ will,' cried the eldest girl, springing to her feet", ' But her father only shook his head sadly', " 'Never will I bring shame upon you,' urged the girl", " 'Let me go", " Am I not a princess, and the daughter of an emperor?' 'Go then!' he said", " The brave girl's heart almost stopped beating from joy, as she set about her preparations", ' She was not still for a single moment, but danced about the house, turning chests and wardrobes upside down  She set aside enough things for a whole year--dresses embroidered with gold and precious stones, and a great store of provisions  And she chose the most spirited horse in the stable, with eyes of flame, and a coat of shining silver  When her father saw her mounted and curvetting about the court, he gave her much wise advice, as to how she was to behave like the young man she appeared to be, and also how to behave as the girl she really was  Then he gave her his blessing, and she touched her horse with the spur  There was once upon a time a King and Queen who had everything they could possibly wish for in this world except a child  At last, after twelve years, the Queen gave birth to a son; but she did not live long to enjoy her happiness, for on the following day she died', " But before her death she called her husband to her and said, 'Never let the child put his feet on the ground, for as soon as he does so he will fall into the power of a wicked Fairy, who will do him much harm", "' And these were the last words the poor Queen spoke", ' The boy throve and grew big, and when he was too heavy for his nurse to carry, a chair was made for him on little wheels, in which he could wander through the palace gardens without help; at other times he was carried about on a litter, and he was always carefully watched and guarded for fear he should at any time put his feet to the ground', " But as this sort of life was bad for his health, the doctors ordered him horse exercise, and he soon became a first-rate rider, and used to go out for long excursions on horseback, accompanied always by his father's stud-groom and a numerous retinue", ' Every day he rode through the neighbouring fields and woods, and always returned home in the evening safe and well', " In this way many years passed, and the Prince grew to manhood, and hardly anyone remembered the Queen's warning, though precautions were still taken, more from use and wont than for any other reason", ' One day the Prince and his suite went out for a ride in a wood where his father sometimes held a hunt  Their way led through a stream whose banks were overgrown with thick brushwood', " Just as the horsemen were about to ford the river, a hare, startled by the sound of the horses' hoofs, started up from the grass and ran towards the thicket", ' The young Prince pursued the little creature, and had almost overtaken it, when the girth of his saddle suddenly broke in two and he fell heavily to the ground  No sooner had his foot touched the earth than he disappeared before the eyes of the horrified courtiers  They sought for him far and near, but all in vain, and they were forced to recognise the power of the evil Fairy, against which the Queen had warned them on her death-bed', " The old King was much grieved when they brought him the news of his son's disappearance, but as he could do nothing to free him from his fate, he gave himself up to an old age of grief and loneliness, cherishing at the same time the hope that some lucky chance might one day deliver the youth out of the hands of his enemy", ' Hardly had the Prince touched the ground than he felt himself violently seized by an unseen power, and hurried away he knew not whither  A whole new world stretched out before him, quite unlike the one he had left  A splendid castle surrounded by a huge lake was the abode of the Fairy, and the only approach to it was over a bridge of clouds  On the other side of the lake high mountains rose up, and dark woods stretched along the banks; over all hung a thick mist, and deep silence reigned everywhere  No sooner had the Fairy reached her own domain than she made herself visible, and turning to the Prince she told him that unless he obeyed all her commands down to the minutest detail he would be severely punished  Then she gave him an axe made of glass, and bade him cross the bridge of clouds and go into the wood beyond and cut down all the trees there before sunset  At the same time she cautioned him with many angry words against speaking to a black girl he would most likely meet in the wood  The Prince listened to her words meekly, and when she had finished took up the glass axe and set out for the forest  At every step he seemed to sink into the clouds, but fear gave wings to his feet, and he crossed the lake in safety and set to work at once  But no sooner had he struck the first blow with his axe than it broke into a thousand pieces against the tree  The poor youth was so terrified he did not know what to do, for he was in mortal dread of the punishment the wicked old Fairy would inflict on him  He wandered to and fro in the wood, not knowing where he was going, and at last, worn out by fatigue and misery, he sank on the ground and fell fast asleep  He did not know how long he had slept when a sudden sound awoke him, and opening his eyes he saw a black girl standing beside him', " Mindful of the Fairy's warning he did not dare to address her, but she on her part greeted him in the most friendly manner, and asked him at once if he were under the power of the wicked Fairy", ' The Prince nodded his head silently in answer  An accomplished wizard once lived on the top floor of a tenement house and passed his time in thoughtful study and studious thought', " What he didn't know about wizardry was hardly worth knowing, for he possessed all the books and recipes of all the wizards who had lived before him; and, moreover, he had invented several wizardments himself", " This admirable person would have been completely happy but for the numerous interruptions to his studies caused by folk who came to consult him about their troubles (in which he was not interested), and by the loud knocks of the iceman, the milkman, the baker's boy, the laundryman and the peanut woman", ' He never dealt with any of these people; but they rapped at his door every day to see him about this or that or to try to sell him their wares  Just when he was most deeply interested in his books or engaged in watching the bubbling of a cauldron there would come a knock at his door  And after sending the intruder away he always found he had lost his train of thought or ruined his compound  At length these interruptions aroused his anger, and he decided he must have a dog to keep people away from his door  He didn\'t know where to find a dog, but in the next room lived a poor glass-blower with whom he had a slight acquaintance; so he went into the man\'s apartment and asked: "Where can I find a dog?" "What sort of a dog?" inquired the glass-blower  "A good dog  One that will bark at people and drive them away', " One that will be no trouble to keep and won't expect to be fed", ' One that has no fleas and is neat in his habits  One that will obey me when I speak to him  In short, a good dog," said the wizard  "Such a dog is hard to find," returned the glass-blower, who was busy making a blue glass flower pot with a pink glass rosebush in it, having green glass leaves and yellow glass roses  The wizard watched him thoughtfully  "Why cannot you blow me a dog out of glass?" he asked, presently  "I can," declared the glass-blower; "but it would not bark at people, you know " "Oh, I\'ll fix that easily enough," replied the other  "If I could not make a glass dog bark I would be a mighty poor wizard " "Very well; if you can use a glass dog I\'ll be pleased to blow one for you  Only, you must pay for my work " "Certainly," agreed the wizard  "But I have none of that horrid stuff you call money  You must take some of my wares in exchange " The glass-blower considered the matter for a moment  "Could you give me something to cure my rheumatism?" he asked  "Oh, yes; easily " "Then it\'s a bargain', " I'll start the dog at once" ,  ' Once upon a time there was a Glass Mountain at the top of which stood a castle made of pure gold, and in front of the castle there grew an apple-tree on which there were golden apples  Anyone who picked an apple gained admittance into the golden castle, and there in a silver room sat an enchanted Princess of surpassing fairness and beauty  She was as rich too as she was beautiful, for the cellars of the castle were full of precious stones, and great chests of the finest gold stood round the walls of all the rooms  Many knights had come from afar to try their luck, but it was in vain they attempted to climb the mountain  In spite of having their horses shod with sharp nails, no one managed to get more than half-way up, and then they all fell back right down to the bottom of the steep slippery hill  Sometimes they broke an arm, sometimes a leg, and many a brave man had broken his neck even  The beautiful Princess sat at her window and watched the bold knights trying to reach her on their splendid horses  The sight of her always gave men fresh courage, and they flocked from the four quarters of the globe to attempt the work of rescuing her  But all in vain, and for seven years the Princess had sat now and waited for some one to scale the Glass Mountain  A heap of corpses both of riders and horses lay round the mountain, and many dying men lay groaning there unable to go any farther with their wounded limbs  The whole neighbourhood had the appearance of a vast churchyard  In three more days the seven years would be at an end, when a knight in golden armour and mounted on a spirited steed was seen making his way towards the fatal hill', " Sticking his spurs into his horse he made a rush at the mountain, and got up half-way, then he calmly turned his horse's head and came down again without a slip or stumble", ' The following day he started in the same way; the horse trod on the glass as if it had been level earth, and sparks of fire flew from its hoofs', " All the other knights gazed in astonishment, for he had almost gained the summit, and in another moment he would have reached the apple-tree; but of a sudden a huge eagle rose up and spread its mighty wings, hitting as it did so the knight's horse in the eye", ' The beast shied, opened its wide nostrils and tossed its mane, then rearing high up in the air, its hind feet slipped and it fell with its rider down the steep mountain side  Nothing was left of either of them except their bones, which rattled in the battered golden armour like dry peas in a pod  And now there was only one more day before the close of the seven years  Then there arrived on the scene a mere schoolboy--a merry, happy-hearted youth, but at the same time strong and well-grown  He saw how many knights had broken their necks in vain, but undaunted he approached the steep mountain on foot and began the ascent  For long he had heard his parents speak of the beautiful Princess who sat in the golden castle at the top of the Glass Mountain  He listened to all he heard, and determined that he too would try his luck', " But first he went to the forest and caught a lynx, and cutting off the creature's sharp claws, he fastened them on to his own hands and feet", ' Armed with these weapons he boldly started up the Glass Mountain  The sun was nearly going down, and the youth had not got more than half-way up  He could hardly draw breath he was so worn out, and his mouth was parched by thirst  A huge black cloud passed over his head, but in vain did he beg and beseech her to let a drop of water fall on him  He opened his mouth, but the black cloud sailed past and not as much as a drop of dew moistened his dry lips  His feet were torn and bleeding, and he could only hold on now with his hands  Evening closed in, and he strained his eyes to see if he could behold the top of the mountain  Once upon a time there lived an emperor whose name was Trojan, and he had ears like a goat', " Every morning, when he was shaved, he asked if the man saw anything odd about him, and as each fresh barber always replied that the emperor had goat's ears, he was at once ordered to be put to death", ' Now after this state of things had lasted a good while, there was hardly a barber left in the town that could shave the emperor, and it came to be the turn of the Master of the Company of Barbers to go up to the palace  But, unluckily, at the very moment that he should have set out, the master fell suddenly ill, and told one of his apprentices that he must go in his stead', " When the youth was taken to the emperor's bedroom, he was asked why he had come and not his master", ' The young man replied that the master was ill, and there was no one but himself who could be trusted with the honour  The emperor was satisfied with the answer, and sat down, and let a sheet of fine linen be put round him', " Directly the young barber began his work, he, like the rest, remarked the goat's ears of the emperor, but when he had finished and the emperor asked his usual question as to whether the youth had noticed anything odd about him, the young man replied calmly, 'No, nothing at all", "' This pleased the emperor so much that he gave him twelve ducats, and said, 'Henceforth you shall come every day to shave me", "' So when the apprentice returned home, and the master inquired how he had got on with the emperor, the young man answered, 'Oh, very well, and he says I am to shave him every day, and he has given me these twelve ducats'; but he said nothing about the goat's ears of the emperor", ' From this time the apprentice went regularly up to the palace, receiving each morning twelve ducats in payment  But after a while, his secret, which he had carefully kept, burnt within him, and he longed to tell it to somebody  His master saw there was something on his mind, and asked what it was  The youth replied that he had been tormenting himself for some months, and should never feel easy until some one shared his secret', " 'Well, trust me,' said the master, 'I will keep it to myself; or, if you do not like to do that, confess it to your pastor, or go into some field outside the town and dig a hole, and, after you have dug it, kneel down and whisper your secret three times into the hole", ' Then put back the earth and come away', "' The apprentice thought that this seemed the best plan, and that very afternoon went to a meadow outside the town, dug a deep hole, then knelt and whispered to it three times over, 'The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears", "' And as he said so a great burden seemed to roll off him, and he shovelled the earth carefully back and ran lightly home", ' Weeks passed away, and there sprang up in the hole an elder tree which had three stems, all as straight as poplars', " Some shepherds, tending their flocks near by, noticed the tree growing there, and one of them cut down a stem to make flutes of; but, directly he began to play, the flute would do nothing but sing: 'The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears", "' Of course, it was not long before the whole town knew of this wonderful flute and what it said; and, at last, the news reached the emperor in his palace", " He instantly sent for the apprentice and said to him: 'What have you been saying about me to all my people?' The culprit tried to defend himself by saying that he had never told anyone what he had noticed; but the emperor, instead of listening, only drew his sword from its sheath, which so frightened the poor fellow that he confessed exactly what he had done, and how he had whispered the truth three times to the earth, and how in that very place an elder tree had sprung up, and flutes had been cut from it, which would only repeat the words he had said", " Then the emperor commanded his coach to be made ready, and he took the youth with him, and they drove to the spot, for he wished to see for himself whether the young man's confession was true; but when they reached the place only one stem was left", ' So the emperor desired his attendants to cut him a flute from the remaining stem, and, when it was ready, he ordered his chamberlain to play on it', " But no tune could the chamberlain play, though he was the best flute player about the court--nothing came but the words, 'The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears", "' Then the emperor knew that even the earth gave up its secrets, and he granted the young man his life, but he never allowed him to be his barber any more", '     That same night several of the servants were having a chat together before going to bed', " 'What can that noise be?' said one of the housemaids, who had been listening for a moment or two", " 'I've heard it the last two nights,' said the cook", " 'If there were any about the place, I should have taken it for rats, but my Tom keeps them far enough", "' 'I've heard, though,' said the scullery-maid, 'that rats move about in great companies sometimes", ' There may be an army of them invading us', " I've heard the noises yesterday and today too", "' 'It'll be grand fun, then, for my Tom and Mrs Housekeeper's Bob,' said the cook", " 'They'll be friends for once in their lives, and fight on the same side", " I'll engage Tom and Bob together will put to flight any number of rats", "' 'It seems to me,' said the nurse, 'that the noises are much too loud for that", ' I have heard them all day, and my princess has asked me several times what they could be  Sometimes they sound like distant thunder, and sometimes like the noises you hear in the mountain from those horrid miners underneath', "' 'I shouldn't wonder,' said the cook, 'if it was the miners after all", ' They may have come on some hole in the mountain through which the noises reach to us  They are always boring and blasting and breaking, you know', "' As he spoke, there came a great rolling rumble beneath them, and the house quivered", ' They all started up in affright, and rushing to the hall found the gentlemen-at-arms in consternation also  They had sent to wake their captain, who said from their description that it must have been an earthquake, an occurrence which, although very rare in that country, had taken place almost within the century; and then went to bed again, strange to say, and fell fast asleep without once thinking of Curdie, or associating the noises they had heard with what he had told them  He had not believed Curdie  If he had, he would at once have thought of what he had said, and would have taken precautions  As they heard nothing more, they concluded that Sir Walter was right, and that the danger was over for perhaps another hundred years  The fact, as discovered afterwards, was that the goblins had, in working up a second sloping face of stone, arrived at a huge block which lay under the cellars of the house, within the line of the foundations  It was so round that when they succeeded, after hard work, in dislodging it without blasting, it rolled thundering down the slope with a bounding, jarring roll, which shook the foundations of the house', " The goblins were themselves dismayed at the noise, for they knew, by careful spying and measuring, that they must now be very near, if not under the king's house, and they feared giving an alarm", ' They, therefore, remained quiet for a while, and when they began to work again, they no doubt thought themselves very fortunate in coming upon a vein of sand which filled a winding fissure in the rock on which the house was built', " By scooping this away they came out in the king's wine cellar", ' No sooner did they find where they were, than they scurried back again, like rats into their holes, and running at full speed to the goblin palace, announced their success to the king and queen with shouts of triumph', " In a moment the goblin royal family and the whole goblin people were on their way in hot haste to the king's house, each eager to have a share in the glory of carrying off that same night the Princess Irene", ' The queen went stumping along in one shoe of stone and one of skin  There was once a hard-working student who lived in an attic, and he had nothing in the world of his own  There was also a hard-working grocer who lived on the first floor, and he had the whole house for his own', " The Goblin belonged to him, for every Christmas Eve there was waiting for him at the grocer's a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the middle", " The grocer could afford this, so the Goblin stayed in the grocer's shop; and this teaches us a good deal", ' One evening the student came in by the back door to buy a candle and some cheese; he had no one to send, so he came himself  He got what he wanted, paid for it, and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife (she was a woman who could do more than nod; she could talk)  When the student had said good night he suddenly stood still, reading the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped', " It was a leaf torn out of an old book--a book of poetry 'There's more of that over there!' said the grocer 'I gave an old woman some coffee for the book", ' If you like to give me twopence you can have the rest', "' 'Yes,' said the student, 'give me the book instead of the cheese", ' I can eat my bread without cheese  It would be a shame to leave the book to be torn up', " You are a clever and practical man, but about poetry you understand as much as that old tub over there!' And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned, but the grocer laughed, and so did the student", ' It was only said in fun  But the Goblin was angry that anyone should dare to say such a thing to a grocer who owned the house and sold the best butter', " When it was night and the shop was shut, and everyone was in bed except the student, the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocer's wife's tongue", ' She did not use it when she was asleep, and on whatever object in the room he put it that thing began to speak, and spoke out its thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged  But only one thing at a time could use it, and that was a good thing, or they would have all spoken together  The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers', " 'Is it true,' he asked, ' that you know nothing about poetry?' 'Certainly not!' answered the tub", " 'Poetry is something that is in the papers, and that is frequently cut out", " I have a great deal more in me than the student has, and yet I am only a small tub in the grocer's shop", "' And the Goblin put the tongue on the coffee-mill, and how it began to grind! He put it on the butter-cask, and on the till, and all were of the same opinion as the waste-paper tub", ' and one must believe the majority', " 'Now I will tell the student!' and with these words he crept softly up the stairs to the attic where the student lived", ' There was a light burning, and the Goblin peeped through the key-hole and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the shop  But how bright it was! Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student', " Every leaf was alive, and every flower was a beautiful girl's head, some with dark and shining eyes, others with wonderful blue ones", " Every fruit was a glittering star, and there was a marvellous music in the student's room", ' The little Goblin had never even dreamt of such a splendid sight, much less seen it  Long, long ago there was a large plain called Adachigahara, in the province of Mutsu in Japan  This place was said to be haunted by a cannibal goblin who took the form of an old woman', " From time to time many travelers disappeared and were never heard of more, and the old women round the charcoal braziers in the evenings, and the girls washing the household rice at the wells in the mornings, whispered dreadful stories of how the missing folk had been lured to the goblin's cottage and devoured, for the goblin lived only on human flesh", ' No one dared to venture near the haunted spot after sunset, and all those who could, avoided it in the daytime, and travelers were warned of the dreaded place  One day as the sun was setting, a priest came to the plain  He was a belated traveler, and his robe showed that he was a Buddhist pilgrim walking from shrine to shrine to pray for some blessing or to crave for forgiveness of sins  He had apparently lost his way, and as it was late he met no one who could show him the road or warn him of the haunted spot', " He had walked the whole day and was now tired and hungry, and the evenings were chilly, for it was late autumn, and he began to be very anxious to find some house where he could obtain a night's lodging", ' He found himself lost in the midst of the large plain, and looked about in vain for some sign of human habitation  At last, after wandering about for some hours, he saw a clump of trees in the distance, and through the trees he caught sight of the glimmer of a single ray of light  He exclaimed with joy: "Oh  surely that is some cottage where I can get a night\'s lodging!" Keeping the light before his eyes he dragged his weary, aching feet as quickly as he could towards the spot, and soon came to a miserable-looking little cottage  As he drew near he saw that it was in a tumble-down condition, the bamboo fence was broken and weeds and grass pushed their way through the gaps  The paper screens which serve as windows and doors in Japan were full of holes, and the posts of the house were bent with age and seemed scarcely able to support the old thatched roof  The hut was open, and by the light of an old lantern an old woman sat industriously spinning  The pilgrim called to her across the bamboo fence and said: "O Baa San (old woman), good evening! I am a traveler! Please excuse me, but I have lost my way and do not know what to do, for I have nowhere to rest to-night  I beg you to be good enough to let me spend the night under your roof " The old woman as soon as she heard herself spoken to stopped spinning, rose from her seat and approached the intruder  "I am very sorry for you  You must indeed be distressed to have lost your way in such a lonely spot so late at night  Unfortunately I cannot put you up, for I have no bed to offer you, and no accommodation whatsoever for a guest in this poor place!" "Oh, that does not matter," said the priest; "all I want is a shelter under some roof for the night, and if you will be good enough just to let me lie on the kitchen floor I shall be grateful  I am too tired to walk further to-night, so I hope you will not refuse me, otherwise I shall have to sleep out on the cold plain " And in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay  She seemed very reluctant, but at last she said: "Very well, I will let you stay here  I can offer you a very poor welcome only, but come in now and I will make a fire, for the night is cold " The pilgrim was only too glad to do as he was told  He took off his sandals and entered the hut  The old woman then brought some sticks of wood and lit the fire, and bade her guest draw near and warm himself  "You must be hungry after your long tramp," said the old woman  "I will go and cook some supper for you  For some time Curdie worked away briskly, throwing all the ore he had disengaged on one side behind him, to be ready for carrying out in the morning  He heard a good deal of goblin-tapping, but it all sounded far away in the hill, and he paid it little heed  Towards midnight he began to feel rather hungry; so he dropped his pickaxe, got out a lump of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock, sat down on a heap of ore, and ate his supper', " Then he leaned back for five minutes' rest before beginning his work again, and laid his head against the rock", ' He had not kept the position for one minute before he heard something which made him sharpen his ears  It sounded like a voice inside the rock  After a while he heard it again  It was a goblin voice--there could be no doubt about that--and this time he could make out the words', " 'Hadn't we better be moving?'it said", " A rougher and deeper voice replied: 'There's no hurry", " That wretched little mole won't be through tonight, if he work ever so hard", " He's not by any means at the thinnest place", "' 'But you still think the lode does come through into our house?' said the first voice", " 'Yes, but a good bit farther on than he has got to yet", " If he had struck a stroke more to the side just here,' said the goblin, tapping the very stone, as it seemed to Curdie, against which his head lay, 'he would have been through; but he's a couple of yards past it now, and if he follow the lode it will be a week before it leads him in", ' You see it back there--a long way  Still, perhaps, in case of accident it would be as well to be getting out of this', " Helfer, you'll take the great chest", " That's your business, you know", "' 'Yes, dad,' said a third voice", " 'But you must help me to get it on my back", " It's awfully heavy, you know", "' 'Well, it isn't just a bag of smoke, I admit", " But you're as strong as a mountain, Helfer", "' 'You say so, dad", " I think myself I'm all right", " But I could carry ten times as much if it wasn't for my feet", "' 'That is your weak point, I confess, my boy", "' 'Ain't it yours too, father?' 'Well, to be honest, it's a goblin weakness", " Why they come so soft, I declare I haven't an idea" ,  ' When Curdie fell asleep he began at once to dream', " He thought he was ascending the Mountainside from the mouth of the mine, whistling and singing 'Ring, dod, bang!' when he came upon a woman and child who had lost their way; and from that point he went on dreaming everything that had happened to him since he thus met the princess and Lootie; how he had watched the goblins, how he had been taken by them, how he had been rescued by the princess; everything, indeed, until he was wounded, captured, and imprisoned by the men-at-arms", ' And now he thought he was lying wide awake where they had laid him, when suddenly he heard a great thundering sound', " 'The cobs are coming!' he said", " 'They didn't believe a word I told them! The cobs'll be carrying off the princess from under their stupid noses! But they shan't! that they shan't!' He jumped up, as he thought, and began to dress, but, to his dismay, found that he was still lying in bed", " 'Now then, I will!' he said", " 'Here goes! I am up now!' But yet again he found himself snug in bed", ' Twenty times he tried, and twenty times he failed; for in fact he was not awake, only dreaming that he was  At length in an agony of despair, fancying he heard the goblins all over the house, he gave a great cry  Then there came, as he thought, a hand upon the lock of his door  It opened, and, looking up, he saw a lady with white hair, carrying a silver box in her hand, enter the room  She came to his bed, he thought, stroked his head and face with cool, soft hands, took the dressing from his leg, rubbed it with something that smelt like roses, and then waved her hands over him three times  At the last wave of her hands everything vanished, he felt himself sinking into the profoundest slumber, and remembered nothing more until he awoke in earnest  The setting moon was throwing a feeble light through the casement, and the house was full of uproar  There was soft heavy multitudinous stamping, a clashing and clanging of weapons, the voices of men and the cries of women, mixed with a hideous bellowing, which sounded victorious  The cobs were in the house! He sprang from his bed, hurried on some of his clothes, not forgetting his shoes, which were armed with nails; then spying an old hunting-knife, or short sword, hanging on the wall, he caught it, and rushed down the stairs, guided by the sounds of strife, which grew louder and louder  When he reached the ground floor he found the whole place swarming  All the goblins of the mountain seemed gathered there', " He rushed amongst them, shouting:  'One, two,  Hit and hew!  Three, four,  Blast and bore!' and with every rhyme he came down a great stamp upon a foot, cutting at the same time their faces--executing, indeed, a sword dance of the wildest description", ' Away scattered the goblins in every direction--into closets, up stairs, into chimneys, up on rafters, and down to the cellars  Curdie went on stamping and slashing and singing, but saw nothing of the people of the house until he came to the great hall, in which, the moment he entered it, arose a great goblin shout  The last of the men-at-arms, the captain himself, was on the floor, buried beneath a wallowing crowd of goblins  For, while each knight was busy defending himself as well as he could, by stabs in the thick bodies of the goblins, for he had soon found their heads all but invulnerable, the queen had attacked his legs and feet with her horrible granite shoe, and he was soon down; but the captain had got his back to the wall and stood out longer  The goblins would have torn them all to pieces, but the king had given orders to carry them away alive, and over each of them, in twelve groups, was standing a knot of goblins, while as many as could find room were sitting upon their prostrate bodies  Curdie burst in dancing and gyrating and stamping and singing like a small incarnate whirlwind', "  'Where 'tis all a hole, sir,  Never can be holes:  Why should their shoes have soles, sir,  When they've got no souls?  'But she upon her foot, sir,  Has a granite shoe:  The strongest leather boot, sir,  Six would soon be through", "' The queen gave a howl of rage and dismay; and before she recovered her presence of mind, Curdie, having begun with the group nearest him, had eleven of the knights on their legs again", " 'Stamp on their feet!' he cried as each man rose, and in a few minutes the hall was nearly empty, the goblins running from it as fast as they could, howling and shrieking and limping, and cowering every now and then as they ran to cuddle their wounded feet in their hard hands, or to protect them from the frightful stamp-stamp of the armed men", ' And now Curdie approached the group which, in trusting in the queen and her shoe, kept their guard over the prostrate captain', " The king sat on the captain's head, but the queen stood in front, like an infuriated cat, with her perpendicular eyes gleaming green, and her hair standing half up from her horrid head" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a great king who had a wife and one son whom he loved very much', " The boy was still young when, one day, the king said to his wife: 'I feel that the hour of my death draws near, and I want you to promise that you will never take another husband but will give up your life to the care of our son", "' The queen burst into tears at these words, and sobbed out that she would never, never marry again, and that her son's welfare should be her first thought as long as she lived", ' Her promise comforted the troubled heart of the king, and a few days after he died, at peace with himself and with the world', " But no sooner was the breath out of his body, than the queen said to herself, 'To promise is one thing, and to keep is quite another", "' And hardly was the last spadeful of earth flung over the coffin than she married a noble from a neighbouring country, and got him made king instead of the young prince", ' Her new husband was a cruel, wicked man, who treated his stepson very badly, and gave him scarcely anything to eat, and only rags to wear; and he would certainly have killed the boy but for fear of the people  Now by the palace grounds there ran a brook, but instead of being a water-brook it was a milk-brook, and both rich and poor flocked to it daily and drew as much milk as they chose  The first thing the new king did when he was seated on the throne, was to forbid anyone to go near the brook, on pain of being seized by the watchmen  And this was purely spite, for there was plenty of milk for everybody  For some days no one dared venture near the banks of the stream, but at length some of the watchmen noticed that early in the mornings, just at dawn, a man with a gold beard came down to the brook with a pail, which he filled up to the brim with milk, and then vanished like smoke before they could get near enough to see who he was  So they went and told the king what they had seen  At first the king would not believe their story, but as they persisted it was quite true, he said that he would go and watch the stream that night himself  With the earliest streaks of dawn the gold-bearded man appeared, and filled his pail as before  Then in an instant he had vanished, as if the earth had swallowed him up  The king stood staring with eyes and mouth open at the place where the man had disappeared  He had never seen him before, that was certain; but what mattered much more was how to catch him, and what should be done with him when he was caught? He would have a cage built as a prison for him, and everyone would talk of it, for in other countries thieves were put in prison, and it was long indeed since any king had used a cage  It was all very well to plan, and even to station a watchman behind every bush, but it was of no use, for the man was never caught  They would creep up to him softly on the grass, as he was stooping to fill his pail, and just as they stretched out their hands to seize him, he vanished before their eyes  Time after time this happened, till the king grew mad with rage, and offered a large reward to anyone who could tell him how to capture his enemy  The first person that came with a scheme was an old soldier who promised the king that if he would only put some bread and bacon and a flask of wine on the bank of the stream, the gold-bearded man would be sure to eat and drink, and they could shake some powder into the wine, which would send him to sleep at once  After that there was nothing to do but to shut him in the cage  This idea pleased the king, and he ordered bread and bacon and a flask of drugged wine to be placed on the bank of the stream, and the watchers to be redoubled  Then, full of hope, he awaited the result  Everything turned out just as the soldier had said  Early next morning the gold-bearded man came down to the brook, ate, drank, and fell sound asleep, so that the watchers easily bound him, and carried him off to the palace  In a moment the king had him fast in the golden cage, and showed him, with ferocious joy, to the strangers who were visiting his court  The poor captive, when he awoke from his drunken sleep, tried to talk to them, but no one would listen to him, so he shut himself up altogether, and the people who came to stare took him for a dumb man of the woods  He wept and moaned to himself all day, and would hardly touch food, though, in dread that he should die and escape his tormentors, the king ordered his head cook to send him dishes from the royal table  The gold-bearded man had been in captivity about a month, when the king was forced to make war upon a neighbouring country, and left the palace, to take command of his army  Now in a certain place there lived a Brahman named Haridatta  He was a farmer, but poor was the return his labour brought him  One day, at the end of the hot hours, the Brahman, overcome by the heat, lay down under the shadow of a tree to have a doze  Suddenly he saw a great hooded snake creeping out of an ant-hill near at hand  So he thought to himself, "Sure this is the guardian deity of the field, and I have not ever worshipped it', " That's why my farming is in vain", ' I will at once go and pay my respects to it " When he had made up his mind, he got some milk, poured it into a bowl, and went to the ant-hill, and said aloud: "O Guardian of this Field! all this while I did not know that you dwelt here  That is why I have not yet paid my respects to you; pray forgive me " And he laid the milk down and went to his house  Next morning he came and looked, and he saw a gold denar in the bowl, and from that time onward every day the same thing occurred: he gave milk to the serpent and found a gold denar  One day the Brahman had to go to the village, and so he ordered his son to take the milk to the ant-hill  The son brought the milk, put it down, and went back home  Next day he went again and found a denar, so he thought to himself: "This ant-hill is surely full of golden denars; I\'ll kill the serpent, and take them all for myself " So next day, while he was giving the milk to the serpent, the Brahman\'s son struck it on the head with a cudgel', " But the serpent escaped death by the will of fate, and in a rage bit the Brahman's son with its sharp fangs, and he fell down dead at once", ' His people raised him a funeral pyre not far from the field and burnt him to ashes', " Two days afterwards his father came back, and when he learnt his son's fate he grieved and mourned", ' But after a time, he took the bowl of milk, went to the ant-hill, and praised the serpent with a loud voice  After a long, long time the serpent appeared, but only with its head out of the opening of the ant-hill, and spoke to the Brahman: "\'Tis greed that brings you here, and makes you even forget the loss of your son  From this time forward friendship between us is impossible  Your son struck me in youthful ignorance, and I have bitten him to death  How can I forget the blow with the cudgel? And how can you forget the pain and grief at the loss of your son?" So speaking, it gave the Brahman a costly pearl and disappeared  But before it went away it said: "Come back no more " The Brahman took the pearl, and went back home, cursing the folly of his son      ONCE upon a time there was a King who was so morose and disagreeable that he was feared by all his subjects, and with good reason, as for the most trifling offences he would have their heads cut off  This King Grumpy, as he was called, had one son, who was as different from his father as he could possibly be  No prince equalled him in cleverness and kindness of heart, but unfortunately he was most terribly ugly  He had crooked legs and squinting eyes, a large mouth all on one side, and a hunchback  Never was there a beautiful soul in such a frightful little body, but in spite of his appearance everybody loved him  The Queen, his mother, called him Curlicue, because it was a name she rather liked, and it seemed to suit him', " King Grumpy, who cared a great deal more for his own grandeur than for his son's happiness, wished to betroth the Prince to the daughter of a neighbouring King, whose great estates joined his own, for he thought that this alliance would make him more powerful than ever, and as for the Princess she would do very well for Prince Curlicue, for she was as ugly as himself", ' Indeed, though she was the most amiable creature in the world, there was no concealing the fact that she was frightful, and so lame that she always went about with a crutch, and people called her Princess Cabbage-Stalk  The King, having asked for and received a portrait of this Princess, had it placed in his great hall under a canopy, and sent for Prince Curlicue, to whom he said that as this was the portrait of his future bride, he hoped the Prince found it charming  The Prince after one glance at it turned away with a disdainful air, which greatly offended his father', " 'Am I to understand that you are not pleased?' he said very sharply", " 'No, sire,' replied the Prince", " 'How could I be pleased to marry an ugly, lame Princess?' 'Certainly it is becoming in YOU to object to that,' said King Grumpy, 'since you are ugly enough to frighten anyone yourself", "' 'That is the very reason,' said the Prince, 'that I wish to marry someone who is not ugly", ' I am quite tired enough of seeing myself', "' 'I tell you that you shall marry her,' cried King Grumpy angrily", ' And the Prince, seeing that it was of no use to remonstrate, bowed and retired  As King Grumpy was not used to being contradicted in anything, he was very much displeased with his son, and ordered that he should be imprisoned in the tower that was kept on purpose for rebellious Princes, but had not been used for about two hundred years, because there had not been any  The Prince thought all the rooms looked strangely old-fashioned, with their antique furniture, but as there was a good library he was pleased, for he was very fond of reading, and he soon got permission to have as many books as he liked  But when he looked at them he found that they were written in a forgotten language, and he could not understand a single word, though he amused himself with trying  King Grumpy was so convinced that Prince Curlicue would soon get tired of being in prison, and so consent to marry the Princess Cabbage-Stalk, that he sent ambassadors to her father proposing that she should come and be married to his son, who would make her perfectly happy', " The King was delighted to receive so good an offer for his unlucky daughter, though, to tell the truth, he found it impossible to admire the Prince's portrait which had been sent to him", ' However, he had it placed in as favourable a light as possible, and sent for the Princess, but the moment she caught sight of it she looked the other way and began to cry', " The King, who was very much annoyed to see how greatly she disliked it, took a mirror, and holding it up before the unhappy Princess, said: 'I see you do not think the Prince handsome, but look at yourself, and see if you have any right to complain about that", "' 'Sire,' she answered, 'I do not wish to complain, only I beg of you do not make me marry at all", ' I had rather be the unhappy Princess Cabbage-Stalk all my life than inflict the sight of my ugliness on anyone else', "' But the King would not listen to her, and sent her away with the ambassadors", ' In the meantime the Prince was kept safely locked up in his tower, and, that he might be as dull as possible, King Grumpy ordered that no one should speak to him, and that they should give him next to nothing to eat  But all the Princess guards were so fond of him that they did everything they dared, in spite of the King, to make the time pass pleasantly  One day, as the Prince was walking up and down the great gallery, thinking how miserable it was to be so ugly, and to be forced to marry an equally frightful Princess, he looked up suddenly and noticed that the painted windows were particularly bright and beautiful, and for the sake of doing something that would change his sad thoughts he began to examine them attentively  Once upon a time there was a fisherman who had a wife and three children  Every morning he used to go out fishing, and whatever fish he caught he sold to the King  One day, among the other fishes, he caught a golden crab  When he came home he put all the fishes together into a great dish, but he kept the Crab separate because it shone so beautifully, and placed it upon a high shelf in the cupboard', " Now while the old woman, his wife, was cleaning the fish, and had tucked up her gown so that her feet were visible, she suddenly heard a voice, which said:      'Let down, let down thy petticoat      That lets thy feet be seen", "' She turned round in surprise, and then she saw the little creature, the Golden Crab", " 'What! You can speak, can you, you ridiculous crab?' she said, for she was not quite pleased at the Crab's remarks", ' Then she took him up and placed him on a dish', " When her husband came home and they sat down to dinner, they presently heard the Crab's little voice saying, 'Give me some too", "' They were all very much surprised, but they gave him something to eat", " When the old man came to take away the plate which had contained the Crab's dinner, he found it full of gold, and as the same thing happened every day he soon became very fond of the Crab", " One day the Crab said to the fisherman's wife, 'Go to the King and tell him I wish to marry his younger daughter", "' The old woman went accordingly, and laid the matter before the King, who laughed a little at the notion of his daughter marrying a crab, but did not decline the proposal altogether, because he was a prudent monarch, and knew that the Crab was likely to be a prince in disguise", " He said, therefore, to the fisherman's wife, 'Go, old woman, and tell the Crab I will give him my daughter if by to-morrow morning he can build a wall in front of my castle much higher than my tower, upon which all the flowers of the world must grow and bloom", "' The fisherman's wife went home and gave this message", " Then the Crab gave her a golden rod, and said, 'Go and strike with this rod three times upon the ground on the place which the King showed you, and to-morrow morning the wall will be there", "' The old woman did so and went away again", " The next morning, when the King awoke, what do you think he saw? The wall stood there before his eyes, exactly as he had bespoken it! Then the old woman went back to the King and said to him, 'Your Majesty's orders have been fulfilled", "' 'That is all very well,' said the King, 'but I cannot give away my daughter until there stands in front of my palace a garden in which there are three fountains, of which the first must play gold, the second diamonds, and the third brilliants", "' So the old woman had to strike again three times upon the ground with the rod, and the next morning the garden was there", ' The King now gave his consent, and the wedding was fixed for the very next day', " Then the Crab said to the old fisherman, 'Now take this rod; go and knock with it on a certain mountain; then a black man(6) will come out and ask you what you wish for", " Answer him thus: ''Your master, the King, has sent me to tell you that you must send him his golden garment that is like the sun", "'' Make him give you, besides, the queenly robes of gold and precious stones which are like the flowery meadows, and bring them both to me", ' And bring me also the golden cushion', "' (6) Ein Mohr", ' The old man went and did his errand  When he had brought the precious robes, the Crab put on the golden garment and then crept upon the golden cushion, and in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle, where the Crab presented the other garment to his bride  Now the ceremony took place, and when the married pair were alone together the Crab made himself known to his young wife, and told her how he was the son of the greatest king in the world, and how he was enchanted, so that he became a crab by day and was a man only at night; and he could also change himself into an eagle as often as he wished  No sooner had he said this than he shook himself, and immediately became a handsome youth, but the next morning he was forced to creep back again into his crab-shell  "This," said old Peter, "is a story against wanting more than enough " Long ago, near the shore of the blue sea, an old man lived with his old woman in a little old hut made of earth and moss and logs  They never had a rouble to spend  A rouble! they never had a kopeck  They just lived there in the little hut, and the old man caught fish out of the sea in his old net, and the old woman cooked the fish; and so they lived, poorly enough in summer and worse in winter  Sometimes they had a few fish to sell, but not often  In the summer evenings they sat outside their hut on a broken old bench, and the old man mended the holes in his ragged old net  There were holes in it a hare could jump through with his ears standing, let alone one of those little fishes that live in the sea  The old woman sat on the bench beside him, and patched his trousers and complained  Well, one day the old man went fishing, as he always did  All day long he fished, and caught nothing  And then in the evening, when he was thinking he might as well give up and go home, he threw his net for the last time, and when he came to pull it in he began to think he had caught an island instead of a haul of fish, and a strong and lively island at that--the net was so heavy and pulled so hard against his feeble old arms  "This time," says he, "I have caught a hundred fish at least " Not a bit of it  The net came in as heavy as if it were full of fighting fish, but empty ----  "Empty?" said Maroosia  "Well, not quite empty," said old Peter, and went on with his tale  Not quite empty, for when the last of the net came ashore there was something glittering in it--a golden fish, not very big and not very little, caught in the meshes  And it was this single golden fish which had made the net so heavy  The old fisherman took the golden fish in his hands  "At least it will be enough for supper," said he  But the golden fish lay still in his hands, and looked at him with wise eyes, and spoke--yes, my dears, it spoke, just as if it were you or I  "Old man," says the fish, "do not kill me  I beg you throw me back into the blue waters  Some day I may be able to be of use to you " "What?" says the old fisherman; "and do you talk with a human voice?" "I do," says the fish  "And my fish\'s heart feels pain like yours  It would be as bitter to me to die as it would be to yourself " "And is that so?" says the old fisherman  "Well, you shall not die this time  THERE was once a man who had three sons  The youngest of them was called Dullhead, and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity  One day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood, and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine, so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst', " When he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him 'Good-morning,' and said: 'Do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine--I am so hungry and thirsty", "' But this clever son replied: 'If I give you my cake and wine I shall have none left for myself; you just go your own way;' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest", ' There he began to cut down a tree, but before long he made a false stroke with his axe, and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up  Then the second son went to the forest, and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother  He too met the little old grey man, who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine', " But the second son spoke most sensibly too, and said: 'Whatever I give to you I deprive myself of", " Just go your own way, will you?' Not long after his punishment overtook him, for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe, than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home", " So then Dullhead said: 'Father, let me go out and cut wood", "' But his father answered: 'Both your brothers have injured themselves", ' You had better leave it alone; you know nothing about it', "' But Dullhead begged so hard to be allowed to go that at last his father said: 'Very well, then--go", ' Perhaps when you have hurt yourself, you may learn to know better', "' His mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and a bottle of sour beer", " When he got to the forest, he too met the little grey old man, who greeted him and said: 'Give me a piece of your cake and a draught from your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty", "' And Dullhead replied: 'I've only got a cinder-cake and some sour beer, but if you care to have that, let us sit down and eat", "' So they sat down, and when Dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake, and the sour beer into excellent wine", " Then they ate and drank, and when they had finished the little man said: 'Now I will bring you luck, because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others", " There stands an old tree; cut it down, and amongst its roots you'll find something", "' With that the little man took leave", ' Then Dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree, and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose, whose feathers were all of pure gold  He lifted it out, carried it off, and took it with him to an inn where he meant to spend the night  Now the landlord of the inn had three daughters, and when they saw the goose they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be, and each longed to have one of its golden feathers', " The eldest thought to herself: 'No doubt I shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers,' and the first time Dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing", ' But, lo and behold! her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose, and she could not take her hand away  Soon after the second daughter came in, and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too; but hardly had she touched her sister than she stuck fast as well', " At last the third sister came with the same intentions, but the other two cried out: 'Keep off! for Heaven's sake, keep off!' The younger sister could not imagine why she was to keep off, and thought to herself: 'If they are both there, why should not I be there too?' So she sprang to them; but no sooner had she touched one of them than she stuck fast to her", ' So they all three had to spend the night with the goose' ,  " There was once a rich merchant who had three sons, and when they were grown up the eldest said to him, 'Father, I wish to travel and see the world", ' I pray you let me', "' So the father ordered a beautiful ship to be fitted up, and the young man sailed away in it", " After some weeks the vessel cast anchor before a large town, and the merchant's son went on shore", " The first thing he saw was a large notice written on a board saying that if any man could find the king's daughter within eight days he should have her to wife, but that if he tried and failed his head must be the forfeit", " 'Well,' thought the youth as he read this proclamation, 'that ought not to be a very difficult matter;' and he asked an audience of the king, and told him that he wished to seek for the princess", " 'Certainly,' replied the king", " 'You have the whole palace to search in; but remember, if you fail it will cost you your head", "' So saying, he commanded the doors to be thrown open, and food and drink to be set before the young man, who, after he had eaten, began to look for the princess", ' But though he visited every corner and chest and cupboard, she was not in any of them, and after eight days he gave it up and his head was cut off  All this time his father and brothers had had no news of him, and were very anxious', " At last the second son could bear it no longer, and said, 'Dear father, give me, I pray you, a large ship and some money, and let me go and seek for my brother", "' So another ship was fitted out, and the young man sailed away, and was blown by the wind into the same harbour where his brother had landed", " Now when he saw the first ship lying at anchor his heart beat high, and he said to himself, 'My brother cannot surely be far off,' and he ordered a boat and was put on shore", " As he jumped on to the pier his eye caught the notice about the princess, and he thought, 'He has undertaken to find her, and has certainly lost his head", ' I must try myself, and seek him as well as her  It cannot be such a very difficult matter', "' But he fared no better than his brother, and in eight days his head was cut off", ' So now there was only the youngest at home, and when the other two never came he also begged for a ship that he might go in search of his lost brothers  And when the vessel started a high wind arose, and blew him straight to the harbour where the notice was set', " 'Oho!' said he, as he read, 'whoever can find the king's daughter shall have her to wife", ' It is quite clear now what has befallen my brothers', " But in spite of that I think I must try my luck,' and he took the road to the castle", ' On the way he met an old woman, who stopped and begged', " 'Leave me in peace, old woman,' replied he", " 'Oh, do not send me away empty,' she said", " 'You are such a handsome young man you will surely not refuse an old woman a few pence", "' 'I tell you, old woman, leave me alone", "' 'You are in some trouble?' she asked", " 'Tell me what it is, and perhaps I can help you" ,  ' Once upon a time there was a goldsmith who lived in a certain village where the people were as bad and greedy, and covetous, as they could possibly be; however, in spite of his surroundings, he was fat and prosperous  He had only one friend whom he liked, and that was a cowherd, who looked after cattle for one of the farmers in the village', " Every evening the goldsmith would walk across to the cowherd's house and say: 'Come, let's go out for a walk!' Now the cowherd didn't like walking in the evening, because, he said, he had been out grazing the cattle all day, and was glad to sit down when night came; but the goldsmith always worried him so that the poor man had to go against his will", ' This at last so annoyed him that he tried to think how he could pick a quarrel with the goldsmith, so that he should not beg him to walk with him any more', " He asked another cowherd for advice, and he said the best thing he could do was to go across and kill the goldsmith's wife, for then the goldsmith would be sure to regard him as an enemy; so, being a foolish person, and there being no laws in that country by which a man would be certainly punished for such a crime, the cowherd one evening took a big stick and went across to the goldsmith's house when only Mrs", ' Goldsmith was at home, and banged her on the head so hard that she died then and there  When the goldsmith came back and found his wife dead he said nothing, but just took her outside into the dark lane and propped her up against the wall of his house, and then went into the courtyard and waited', " Presently a rich stranger came along the lane, and seeing someone there, as he supposed, he said: 'Good-evening, friend! a fine night to- night!' But the goldsmith's wife said nothing", ' The man then repeated his words louder; but still there was no reply', " A third time he shouted: 'Good-evening, friend! are you deaf?' but the figure never replied", ' Then the stranger, being angry at what he thought very rude behaviour, picked up a big stone and threw it at Mrs', " Goldsmith, crying: 'Let that teach you manners!' Instantly poor Mrs", " Goldsmith tumbled over; and the stranger, horrified at seeing what he had done, was immediately seized by the goldsmith, who ran out screaming: 'Wretch! you have killed my wife! Oh, miserable one; we will have justice done to thee!' With many protestations and reproaches they wrangled together, the stranger entreating the goldsmith to say nothing and he would pay him handsomely to atone for the sad accident", ' At last the goldsmith quieted down, and agreed to accept one thousand gold pieces from the stranger, who immediately helped him to bury his poor wife, and then rushed off to the guest house, packed up his things and was off by daylight, lest the goldsmith should repent and accuse him as the murderer of his wife  Now it very soon appeared that the goldsmith had a lot of extra money, so that people began to ask questions, and finally demanded of him the reason for his sudden wealth', " 'Oh,' said he, 'my wife died, and I sold her", "' 'You sold your dead wife?' cried the people", " 'Yes,' said the goldsmith", " 'For how much?' 'A thousand gold pieces,' replied the goldsmith", ' Instantly the villagers went away and each caught hold of his own wife and throttled her, and the next day they all went off to sell their dead wives  Many a weary mile did they tramp, but got nothing but hard words or laughter, or directions to the nearest cemetery, from people to whom they offered dead wives for sale  At last they perceived that they had been cheated somehow by that goldsmith  So off they rushed home, seized the unhappy man, and, without listening to his cries and entreaties, hurried him down to the river bank and flung him--plop!--into the deepest, weediest, and nastiest place they could find', " 'That will teach him to play tricks on us,' said they", " 'For as he can't swim he'll drown, and we sha'n't have any more trouble with him!' Now the goldsmith really could not swim, and as soon as he was thrown into the deep river he sank below the surface; so his enemies went away believing that they had seen the last of him", " But, in reality, he was carried down, half drowned, below the next bend in the river, where he fortunately came across a 'snag' floating in the water (a snag is, you know, a part of a tree or bush which floats very nearly under the surface of the water); and he held on to this snag, and by great good luck eventually came ashore some two or three miles down the river", ' At the place where he landed he came across a fine fat cow buffalo, and immediately he jumped on her back and rode home', " When the village people saw him, they ran out in surprise, and said: 'Where on earth do you come from, and where did you get that buffalo?' 'Ah!' said the goldsmith, 'you little know what delightful adventures I have had! Why, down in that place in the river where you threw me in I found meadows, and trees, and fine pastures, and buffaloes, and all kinds of cattle", ' In fact, I could hardly tear myself away; but I thought that I must really let you all know about it', "' 'Oh, oh!' thought the greedy village people; 'if there are buffaloes to be had for the taking we'll go after some too" ,  ' An old queen, whose husband had been dead some years, had a beautiful daughter  When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country', " Then the queen, her mother, packed up a great many costly things--jewels, and gold, and silver, trinkets, fine dresses, and in short, everything that became a royal bride; for she loved her child very dearly; and she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom's hands; and each had a horse for the journey", " Now the princess' horse was called Falada, and could speak", ' When the time came for them to set out, the old queen went into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to her daughter, saying, "Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road " Then they took a sorrowful leave of each other, and the princess put the lock of her mother\'s hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom\'s kingdom  One day, as they were riding along by the side of a brook, the princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to her maid, "Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink " "Nay," said the maid, "if you are thirsty, get down yourself, and lie down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer " The princess was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the little brook and drank, for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and then she wept, and said, "Alas! what will become of me?" And the lock of hair answered her, and said--  "Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,  Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it " But the princess was very humble and meek, so she said nothing to her maid\'s ill behavior, but got upon her horse again  Then all rode further on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid\'s rude speech, and said, "Pray get down and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup " But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before, "Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid " Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried, and said, "What will become of me?" And the lock of hair answered her again--  "Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,  Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it " And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom and floated away with the water, without her seeing it, she was so much frightened  But her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm, and saw that the poor bride would be in her power now that she had lost the hair  So when the bride had finished drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, "I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse instead;" so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes, and put on her maid\'s shabby ones  At last, as they drew near the end of the journey, this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had happened  But Falada saw it all, and marked it well  Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride was set upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court  There was great joy at their coming, and the prince hurried to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber, but the true princess was told to stay in the court below  However, the old king happened to be looking out of the window, and saw her in the yard below; and as she looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went into the royal chamber to ask the bride whom it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the court below  "I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road," said she  "Pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle " The old king could not for some time think of any work for her, but at last he said, "I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him " Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king\'s geese, was Curdken  Soon after, the false bride said to the prince, "Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness " "That I will," said the prince  "Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road " But the truth was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should speak, and tell all she had done to the princess', " She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada's head against a large dark gate in the city through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes" ,  ' There was once upon a time a man and woman who had three fine-looking sons, but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for themselves, let alone their children  So the sons determined to set out into the world and to try their luck  Before starting their mother gave them each a loaf of bread and her blessing, and having taken a tender farewell of her and their father the three set forth on their travels  The youngest of the three brothers, whose name was Ferko, was a beautiful youth, with a splendid figure, blue eyes, fair hair, and a complexion like milk and roses  His two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be, for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be  One day all the three were sitting resting under a tree, for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking', " Ferko fell fast asleep, but the other two remained awake, and the eldest said to the second brother, 'What do you say to doing our brother Ferko some harm? He is so beautiful that everyone takes a fancy to him, which is more than they do to us", ' If we could only get him out of the way we might succeed better', "' 'I quite agree with you,' answered the second brother, 'and my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread, and then to refuse to give him a bit of ours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs", "' His eldest brother was delighted with this proposal, and the two wicked wretches seized Ferko's loaf and ate it all up, while the poor boy was still asleep", " When he did awake he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread, but his brothers cried out, 'You ate your loaf in your sleep, you glutton, and you may starve as long as you like, but you won't get a scrap of ours", "' Ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep, but he said nothing, and fasted all that day and the next night", ' But on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears, and implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread', " Then the cruel creatures laughed, and repeated what they had said the day before; but when Ferko continued to beg and beseech them, the eldest said at last, 'If you will let us put out one of your eyes and break one of your legs, then we will give you a bit of our bread", "' At these words poor Ferko wept more bitterly than before, and bore the torments of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens; then he could stand it no longer, and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out and his left leg to be broken", ' When this was done he stretched out his hand eagerly for the piece of bread, but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment and besought them for a second bit  But the more Ferko wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger, the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed  So he endured the pangs of starvation all that day, but when night came his endurance gave way, and he let his right eye be put out and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread  After his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for life, they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey without him  Poor Ferko ate up the scrap of bread they had left him and wept bitterly, but no one heard him or came to his help  Night came on, and the poor blind youth had no eyes to close, and could only crawl along the ground, not knowing in the least where he was going  But when the sun was once more high in the heavens, Ferko felt the blazing heat scorch him, and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs  He climbed to the top of a hill and lay down in the grass, and as he thought under the shadow of a big tree  But it was no tree he leant against, but a gallows on which two ravens were seated', " The one was saying to the other as the weary youth lay down, 'Is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighbourhood?' 'I should just think there was,' replied the other; 'many things that don't exist anywhere else in the world", " There is a lake down there below us, and anyone who bathes in it, though he were at death's door, becomes sound and well on the spot, and those who wash their eyes with the dew on this hill become as sharp-sighted as the eagle, even if they have been blind from their youth", "' 'Well,' answered the first raven, 'my eyes are in no want of this healing bath, for, Heaven be praised, they are as good as ever they were; but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many years ago, so let us fly at once to the lake that I may be restored to health and strength again", "' And so they flew away", " Their words rejoiced Ferko's heart, and he waited impatiently till evening should come and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes", ' At last it began to grow dusk, and the sun sank behind the mountains; gradually it became cooler on the hill, and the grass grew wet with dew  Once upon a time the king of the Goldland lost himself in a forest, and try as he would he could not find the way out  As he was wandering down one path which had looked at first more hopeful than the rest he saw a man coming towards him', " 'What are you doing here, friend?' asked the stranger; 'darkness is falling fast, and soon the wild beasts will come from their lairs to seek for food", "' 'I have lost myself,' answered the king, 'and am trying to get home", "' 'Then promise me that you will give me the first thing that comes out of your house, and I will show you the way,' said the stranger", " The king did not answer directly, but after awhile he spoke: 'Why should I give away my BEST sporting dog", ' I can surely find my way out of the forest as well as this man', "' So the stranger left him, but the king followed path after path for three whole days, with no better success than before", ' He was almost in despair, when the stranger suddenly appeared, blocking up his way', " 'Promise you will give me the first thing that comes out of your house to meet you?' But still the king was stiff-necked and would promise nothing", ' For some days longer he wandered up and down the forest, trying first one path, then another, but his courage at last gave way, and he sank wearily on the ground under a tree, feeling sure his last hour had come', " Then for the third time the stranger stood before the king, and said: 'Why are you such a fool? What can a dog be to you, that you should give your life for him like this? Just promise me the reward I want, and I will guide you out of the forest", "' 'Well, my life is worth more than a thousand dogs,' answered the king, 'the welfare of my kingdom depends on me", ' I accept your terms, so take me to my palace', "' Scarcely had he uttered the words than he found himself at the edge of the wood, with the palace in the dim distance", ' He made all the haste he could, and just as he reached the great gates out came the nurse with the royal baby, who stretched out his arms to his father  The king shrank back, and ordered the nurse to take the baby away at once  Then his great boarhound bounded up to him, but his caresses were only answered by a violent push', " When the king's anger was spent, and he was able to think what was best to be done, he exchanged his baby, a beautiful boy, for the daughter of a peasant, and the prince lived roughly as the son of poor people, while the little girl slept in a golden cradle, under silken sheets", ' At the end of a year, the stranger arrived to claim his property, and took away the little girl, believing her to be the true child of the king  The king was so delighted with the success of his plan that he ordered a great feast to be got ready, and gave splendid presents to the foster parents of his son, so that he might lack nothing  But he did not dare to bring back the baby, lest the trick should be found out  The peasants were quite contented with this arrangement, which gave them food and money in abundance  By-and-by the boy grew big and tall, and seemed to lead a happy life in the house of his foster parents', " But a shadow hung over him which really poisoned most of his pleasure, and that was the thought of the poor innocent girl who had suffered in his stead, for his foster father had told him in secret, that he was the king's son", ' And the prince determined that when he grew old enough he would travel all over the world, and never rest till he had set her free', " To become king at the cost of a maiden's life was too heavy a price to pay", ' So one day he put on the dress of a farm servant, threw a sack of peas on his back, and marched straight into the forest where eighteen years before his father had lost himself', " After he had walked some way he began to cry loudly: 'Oh, how unlucky I am! Where can I be? Is there no one to show me the way out of the wood?' Then appeared a strange man with a long grey beard, with a leather bag hanging from his girdle", " He nodded cheerfully to the prince, and said: 'I know this place well, and can lead you out of it, if you will promise me a good reward" ,  ' In old times, when all kinds of wonderful things happened in Brittany, there lived in the village of Lanillis, a young man named Houarn Pogamm and a girl called Bellah Postik', " They were cousins, and as their mothers were great friends, and constantly in and out of each other's houses, they had often been laid in the same cradle, and had played and fought over their games", " 'When they are grown up they will marry,' said the mothers; but just as every one was beginning to think of wedding bells, the two mothers died, and the cousins, who had no money, went as servants in the same house", ' This was better than being parted, of course, but not so good as having a little cottage of their own, where they could do as they liked, and soon they might have been heard bewailing to each other the hardness of their lots', " 'If we could only manage to buy a cow and get a pig to fatten,' grumbled Houarn, 'I would rent a bit of ground from the master, and then we could be married", "' 'Yes,' answered Bellah, with a deep sigh; 'but we live in such hard times, and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again", "' 'We shall have long to wait, that is quite clear,' replied Houarn, turning away to his work", " Whenever they met they repeated their grievances, and at length Houarn's patience was exhausted, and one morning he came to Bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune", ' The girl was very unhappy as she listened to this, and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things  She implored Houarn not to leave her, but he would listen to nothing', " 'The birds,' he said, 'continue flying until they reach a field of corn, and the bees do not stop unless they find the honey-giving flowers, and why should a man have less sense than they? Like them, I shall seek till I get what I want--that is, money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten", " And if you love me, Bellah, you won't attempt to hinder a plan which will hasten our marriage", "' The girl saw it was useless to say more, so she answered sadly: 'Well, go then, since you must", " But first I will divide with you all that my parents left me,' and going to her room, she opened a small chest, and took from it a bell, a knife, and a little stick", " 'This bell,' she said, 'can be heard at any distance, however far, but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger", ' The knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them; while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go  I will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards, and the bell to tell me of your perils  The stick I shall keep for myself, so that I can fly to you if ever you have need of me', "' Then they cried for a little on each other's necks, and Houarn started for the mountains", ' But in those days, as in these, beggars abounded, and through every village he passed they followed Houarn in crowds, mistaking him for a gentleman, because there were no holes in his clothes', " 'There is no fortune to be made here,' he thought to himself; 'it is a place for spending, and not earning", " I see I must go further,' and he walked on to Pont-aven, a pretty little town built on the bank of a river", " He was sitting on a bench outside an inn, when he heard two men who were loading their mules talking about the Groac'h of the island of Lok", " 'What is a Groac'h?' asked he", " 'I have never come across one", "' And the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake, and that she was rich--oh! richer than all the kings in the world put together", ' Many had gone to the island to try and get possession of her treasures, but no one had ever come back', " As he listened Houarn's mind was made up", " 'I will go, and return too,' he said to the muleteers", ' They stared at him in astonishment, and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his life in such a foolish manner; but he only laughed, and answered that if they could tell him of any other way in which to procure a cow and a pig to fatten, he would think no more about it' ,  " Somewhere or other, but I don't know where, there lived a king who owned two remarkably fine fields of rape, but every night two of the rape heaps were burnt down in one of the fields", ' The king was extremely angry at this, and sent out soldiers to catch whoever had set fire to the ricks; but it was all of no use--not a soul could they see  Then he offered nine hundred crowns to anyone who caught the evil-doer, and at the same time ordered that whoever did not keep proper watch over the fields should be killed; but though there were a great many people, none seemed able to protect the fields', " The king had already put ninety-nine people to death, when a little swineherd came to him who had two dogs; one was called 'Psst,' and the other 'Hush'; and the boy told the king that he would watch over the ricks", ' When it grew dark he climbed up on the top of the fourth rick, from where he could see the whole field', " About eleven o'clock he thought he saw someone going to a rick and putting a light to it", " 'Just you wait,' thought he, and called out to his dogs: 'Hi! Psst, Hush, catch him!' But Psst and Hush had not waited for orders, and in five minutes the man was caught", ' Next morning he was brought bound before the king, who was so pleased with the boy that he gave him a thousand crowns at once  The prisoner was all covered with hair, almost like an animal; and altogether he was so curious to look at that the king locked him up in a strong room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come and see this wonder  That was all very well; but the king had a little boy of ten years old who went to look at the hairy man also, and the man begged so hard to be set free that the boy took pity on him  He stole the key of the strong room from his mother and opened the door  Then he took the key back, but the hairy man escaped and went off into the world  Then the kings and princes began to arrive one after another, and all were most anxious to see the hairy man; but he was gone! The king nearly burst with rage and with the shame he felt  He questioned his wife sharply, and told her that if she could not find and bring back the hairy man he would put her in a hut made of rushes and burn her there  The queen declared she had had nothing to do with the matter; if her son had happened to take the key it had not been with her knowledge  So they fetched the little prince and asked him all sorts of questions, and at last he owned that he had let the hairy man out  The king ordered his servants to take the boy into the forest and to kill him there, and to bring back part of his liver and lungs', " There was grief all over the palace when the king's command was known, for he was a great favourite", ' But there was no help for it, and they took the boy out into the forest  But the man was sorry for him, and shot a dog and carried pieces of his lungs and liver to the king, who was satisfied, and did not trouble himself any more  The prince wandered about in the forest and lived as best he could for five years  One day he came upon a poor little cottage in which was an old man  They began to talk, and the prince told his story and sad fate  Then they recognised each other, for the old fellow was no other than the hairy man whom the prince had set free, and who had lived ever since in the forest  The prince stayed here for two years; then he wished to go further  The old man begged him hard to stay, but he would not, so his hairy friend gave him a golden apple out of which came a horse with a golden mane, and a golden staff with which to guide the horse  The old man also gave him a silver apple out of which came the most beautiful hussars and a silver staff; and a copper apple from which he could draw as many foot soldiers as ever he wished, and a copper staff  He made the prince swear solemnly to take the greatest care of these presents, and then he let him go  The boy wandered on and on till he came to a large town', " Here he took service in the king's palace, and as no one troubled themselves about him he lived quietly on" ,  ' A sound of many soft feet followed, but soon ceased  Then Curdie flew at the hole like a tiger, and tore and pulled  The sides gave way, and it was soon large enough for him to crawl through  He would not betray himself by rekindling his lamp, but the torches of the retreating company, which he found departing in a straight line up a long avenue from the door of their cave, threw back light enough to afford him a glance round the deserted home of the goblins  To his surprise, he could discover nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary natural cave in the rock, upon many of which he had come with the rest of the miners in the progress of their excavations  The goblins had talked of coming back for the rest of their household gear: he saw nothing that would have made him suspect a family had taken shelter there for a single night  The floor was rough and stony; the walls full of projecting corners; the roof in one place twenty feet high, in another endangering his forehead; while on one side a stream, no thicker than a needle, it is true, but still sufficient to spread a wide dampness over the wall, flowed down the face of the rock  But the troop in front of him was toiling under heavy burdens  He could distinguish Helfer now and then, in the flickering light and shade, with his heavy chest on his bending shoulders; while the second brother was almost buried in what looked like a great feather bed', " 'Where do they get the feathers?' thought Curdie; but in a moment the troop disappeared at a turn of the way, and it was now both safe and necessary for Curdie to follow them, lest they should be round the next turning before he saw them again, for so he might lose them altogether", ' He darted after them like a greyhound  When he reached the corner and looked cautiously round, he saw them again at some distance down another long passage  None of the galleries he saw that night bore signs of the work of man--or of goblin either  Stalactites, far older than the mines, hung from their roofs; and their floors were rough with boulders and large round stones, showing that there water must have once run  He waited again at this corner till they had disappeared round the next, and so followed them a long way through one passage after another  The passages grew more and more lofty, and were more and more covered in the roof with shining stalactites  It was a strange enough procession which he followed  But the strangest part of it was the household animals which crowded amongst the feet of the goblins  It was true they had no wild animals down there--at least they did not know of any; but they had a wonderful number of tame ones  I must, however, reserve any contributions towards the natural history of these for a later position in my story  At length, turning a corner too abruptly, he had almost rushed into the middle of the goblin family; for there they had already set down all their burdens on the floor of a cave considerably larger than that which they had left  They were as yet too breathless to speak, else he would have had warning of their arrest  He started back, however, before anyone saw him, and retreating a good way, stood watching till the father should come out to go to the palace  Before very long, both he and his son Helfer appeared and kept on in the same direction as before, while Curdie followed them again with renewed precaution  For a long time he heard no sound except something like the rush of a river inside the rock; but at length what seemed the far-off noise of a great shouting reached his ears, which, however, presently ceased  After advancing a good way farther, he thought he heard a single voice  It sounded clearer and clearer as he went on, until at last he could almost distinguish the words  In a moment or two, keeping after the goblins round another corner, he once more started back--this time in amazement  He was at the entrance of a magnificent cavern, of an oval shape, once probably a huge natural reservoir of water, now the great palace hall of the goblins  It rose to a tremendous height, but the roof was composed of such shining materials, and the multitude of torches carried by the goblins who crowded the floor lighted up the place so brilliantly, that Curdie could see to the top quite well' ,  " Really, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over one's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for it is so immensely large", " The burdock never grows alone, but where there grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this delightfulness is snails' food", ' The great white snails which persons of quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, "Hem, hem! how delicious!" for they thought it tasted so delicate--lived on dock-leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown  Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and grew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery over them--it was a whole forest of burdocks  Here and there stood an apple and a plum-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was a garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old snails  They themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember very well that there had been many more; that they were of a family from foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was planted  They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was still something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and that there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then placed on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in fact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could not possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly genteel  Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they asked about it could give them any information--none of them had been boiled or laid on a silver dish  The old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the world, that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the manor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver dish', " Now they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no children themselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up as their own; but the little one would not grow, for he was of a common family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother Snail, thought they could observe how he increased in size, and she begged father, if he could not see it, that he would at least feel the little snail's shell; and then he felt it, and found the good dame was right", ' One day there was a heavy storm of rain  "Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves!" said Father Snail  "There are also rain-drops!" said Mother Snail  "And now the rain pours right down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I am very happy to think that we have our good house, and the little one has his also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures, sure enough; but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world? We are provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock forest is planted for our sakes! I should like to know how far it extends, and what there is outside!" "There is nothing at all," said Father Snail  "No place can be better than ours, and I have nothing to wish for!" "Yes," said the dame  "I would willingly go to the manorhouse, be boiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated so; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!" "The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!" said Father Snail  "Or the burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out  There need not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always in such a tremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the same  Has he not been creeping up that stalk these three days? It gives me a headache when I look up to him!" "You must not scold him," said Mother Snail  "He creeps so carefully; he will afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for! But have you not thought of it? Where shall we get a wife for him? Do you not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in the interior of the burdock forest?" "Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of," said the old one  "Black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so conceited  But we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run to and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a wife for our little snail!" "I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!" said one of the ants  "But I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!" "That is nothing!" said the old folks  "Has she a house?" "She has a palace!" said the ant  "The finest ant\'s palace, with seven hundred passages!" "I thank you!" said Mother Snail  "Our son shall not go into an ant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the commission to the white gnats  They fly far and wide, in rain and sunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without " "We have a wife for him," said the gnats  "At a hundred human paces from here there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she is quite lonely, and old enough to be married  It is only a hundred human paces!" "Well, then, let her come to him!" said the old ones  Long, long ago Japan was governed by Hohodemi, the fourth Mikoto (or Augustness) in descent from the illustrious Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess  He was not only as handsome as his ancestress was beautiful, but he was also very strong and brave, and was famous for being the greatest hunter in the land  Because of his matchless skill as a hunter, he was called "Yama-sachi-hiko" or "The Happy Hunter of the Mountains " His elder brother was a very skillful fisher, and as he far surpassed all rivals in fishing, he was named "Umi-sachi-hiko" or the "Skillful Fisher of the Sea " The brothers thus led happy lives, thoroughly enjoying their respective occupations, and the days passed quickly and pleasantly while each pursued his own way, the one hunting and the other fishing  One day the Happy Hunter came to his brother, the Skillful Fisher, and said: "Well, my brother, I see you go to the sea every day with your fishing rod in your hand, and when you return you come laden with fish  And as for me, it is my pleasure to take my bow and arrow and to hunt the wild animals up the mountains and down in the valleys  For a long time we have each followed our favorite occupation, so that now we must both be tired, you of your fishing and I of my hunting  Would it not be wise for us to make a change? Will you try hunting in the mountains and I will go and fish in the sea?" The Skillful Fisher listened in silence to his brother, and for a moment was thoughtful, but at last he answered: "O yes, why not? Your idea is not a bad one at all  Give me your bow and arrow and I will set out at once for the mountains and hunt for game " So the matter was settled by this talk, and the two brothers each started out to try the other\'s occupation, little dreaming of all that would happen  It was very unwise of them, for the Happy Hunter knew nothing of fishing, and the Skillful Fisher, who was bad tempered, knew as much about hunting', " The Happy Hunter took his brother's much-prized fishing hook and rod and went down to the seashore and sat down on the rocks", ' He baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily  He sat and gazed at the little float bobbing up and down in the water, and longed for a good fish to come and be caught  Every time the buoy moved a little he pulled up his rod, but there was never a fish at the end of it, only the hook and the bait  If he had known how to fish properly, he would have been able to catch plenty of fish, but although he was the greatest hunter in the land he could not help being the most bungling fisher  The whole day passed in this way, while he sat on the rocks holding the fishing rod and waiting in vain for his luck to turn  At last the day began to darken, and the evening came; still he had caught not a single fish  Drawing up his line for the last time before going home, he found that he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it  He now began to feel extremely anxious, for he knew that his brother would be angry at his having lost his hook, for, it being his only one, he valued it above all other things  The Happy Hunter now set to work to look among the rocks and on the sand for the lost hook, and while he was searching to and fro, his brother, the Skillful Fisher, arrived on the scene  He had failed to find any game while hunting that day, and was not only in a bad temper, but looked fearfully cross  When he saw the Happy Hunter searching about on the shore he knew that something must have gone wrong, so he said at once: "What are you doing, my brother?" The Happy Hunter went forward timidly, for he feared his brother\'s anger, and said: "Oh, my brother, I have indeed done badly " "What is the matter?--what have you done?" asked the elder brother impatiently  "I have lost your precious fishing hook--" While he was still speaking his brother stopped him, and cried out fiercely: "Lost my hook! It is just what I expected  For this reason, when you first proposed your plan of changing over our occupations I was really against it, but you seemed to wish it so much that I gave in and allowed you to do as you wished  The mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen! And you have done badly  I will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook  Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly  HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt  He was very much admired indeed  "He is as beautiful as a weathercock," remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; "only not quite so useful," he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not  "Why can\'t you be like the Happy Prince?" asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon  "The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything " "I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy," muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue  "He looks just like an angel," said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores  "How do you know?" said the Mathematical Master, "you have never seen one " "Ah! but we have, in our dreams," answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming  One night there flew over the city a little Swallow  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her  "Shall I love you?" said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer  "It is a ridiculous attachment," twittered the other Swallows; "she has no money, and far too many relations"; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away  After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love  "She has no conversation," he said, "and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind " And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys  "I admit that she is domestic," he continued, "but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also " "Will you come away with me?" he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home  "You have been trifling with me," he cried  "I am off to the Pyramids  Good-bye!" and he flew away  All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city  "Where shall I put up?" he said; "I hope the town has made preparations " Then he saw the statue on the tall column  "I will put up there," he cried; "it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air  There was once upon a time a couple who had no children, and they prayed Heaven every day to send them a child, though it were no bigger than a hazel-nut  At last Heaven heard their prayer and sent them a child exactly the size of a hazel-nut, and it never grew an inch  The parents were very devoted to the little creature, and nursed and tended it carefully  Their tiny son too was as clever as he could be, and so sharp and sensible that all the neighbours marvelled over the wise things he said and did', " When the Hazel-nut child was fifteen years old, and was sitting one day in an egg-shell on the table beside his mother, she turned to him and said, 'You are now fifteen years old, and nothing can be done with you", " What do you intend to be?' 'A messenger,' answered the Hazel-nut child", " Then his mother burst out laughing and said, 'What an idea! You a messenger! Why, your little feet would take an hour to go the distance an ordinary person could do in a minute!' But the Hazel-nut child replied, 'Nevertheless I mean to be a messenger! Just send me a message and you'll see that I shall be back in next to no time", "' So his mother said, 'Very well, go to your aunt in the neighbouring village, and fetch me a comb", "' The Hazel-nut child jumped quickly out of the egg-shell and ran out into the street", ' Here he found a man on horseback who was just setting out for the neighbouring village', " He crept up the horse's leg, sat down under the saddle, and then began to pinch the horse and to prick it with a pin", " The horse plunged and reared and then set off at a hard gallop, which it continued in spite of its rider's efforts to stop it", " When they reached the village, the Hazel-nut child left off pricking the horse, and the poor tired creature pursued its way at a snail's pace", " The Hazel-nut child took advantage of this, and crept down the horse's leg; then he ran to his aunt and asked her for a comb", ' On the way home he met another rider, and did the return journey in exactly the same way', " When he handed his mother the comb that his aunt had given him, she was much amazed and asked him, 'But how did you manage to get back so quickly?' 'Ah! mother,' he replied, 'you see I was quite right when I said I knew a messenger was the profession for me", "' His father too possessed a horse which he often used to take out into the fields to graze", ' One day he took the Hazel-nut child with him', " At midday the father turned to his small son and said, 'Stay here and look after the horse", ' I must go home and give your mother a message, but I shall be back soon', "' When his father had gone, a robber passed by and saw the horse grazing without any one watching it, for of course he could not see the Hazel-nut child hidden in the grass", ' So he mounted the horse and rode away', " But the Hazel-nut child, who was the most active little creature, climbed up the horse's tail and began to bite it on the back, enraging the creature to such an extent that it paid no attention to the direction the robber tried to make it go in, but galloped straight home", ' The father was much astonished when he saw a stranger riding his horse, but the Hazel-nut child climbed down quickly and told him all that had happened, and his father had the robber arrested at once and put into prison', " One autumn when the Hazel-nut child was twenty years old he said to his parents: 'Farewell, my dear father and mother", ' I am going to set out into the world, and as soon as I have become rich I will return home to you', "' The parents laughed at the little man's words, but did not believe him for a moment", ' In the evening the Hazel-nut child crept on to the roof, where some storks had built their nest  The storks were fast asleep, and he climbed on to the back of the father-stork and bound a silk cord round the joint of one of its wings, then he crept among its soft downy feathers and fell asleep  The next morning the storks flew towards the south, for winter was approaching  There was once a minister who spent his whole time in trying to find a servant who would undertake to ring the church bells at midnight, in addition to all his other duties  Of course it was not everyone who cared to get up in the middle of the night, when he had been working hard all day; still, a good many had agreed to do it  But the strange thing was that no sooner had the servant set forth to perform his task than he disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed him up  No bells were rung, and no ringer ever came back  The minister did his best to keep the matter secret, but it leaked out for all that, and the end of it was that no one would enter his service  Indeed, there were even those who whispered that the minister himself had murdered the missing men! It was to no purpose that Sunday after Sunday the minister gave out from his pulpit that double wages would be paid to anyone that would fulfil the sacred duty of ringing the bells of the church  No one took the slightest notice of any offer he might make, and the poor man was in despair, when one day, as he was standing at his house door, a youth known in the village as Clever Hans came up to him', " 'I am tired of living with a miser who will not give me enough to eat and drink,' said he, 'and I am ready to do all you want", "' 'Very good, my son,' replied the minister, 'you shall have the chance of proving your courage this very night", ' To-morrow we will settle what your wages are to be', "' Hans was quite content with this proposal, and went straight into the kitchen to begin his work, not knowing that his new master was quite as stingy as his old one", " In the hope that his presence might be a restraint upon them, the minister used to sit at the table during his servants' meals, and would exhort them to drink much and often, thinking that they would not be able to eat as well, and beef was dearer than beer", ' But in Hans he had met his match, and the minister soon found to his cost that in his case at any rate a full cup did not mean an empty plate  About an hour before midnight, Hans entered the church and locked the door behind him, but what was his surprise when, in place of the darkness and silence he expected, he found the church brilliantly lighted, and a crowd of people sitting round a table playing cards  Hans felt no fear at this strange sight, or was prudent enough to hide it if he did, and, going up to the table, sat down amongst the players', " One of them looked up and asked, 'My friend, what are you doing here?' and Hans gazed at him for a moment, then laughed and answered, 'Well, if anybody has a right to put that question, it is I! And if _I_ do not put it, it will certainly be wiser for you not to do so!' Then he picked up some cards, and played with the unknown men as if he had known them all his life", ' The luck was on his side, and soon the money of the other gamblers found its way from their pockets into his  On the stroke of midnight the cock crew, and in an instant lights, table, cards, and people all had vanished, and Hans was left alone  He groped about for some time, till he found the staircase in the tower, and then began to feel his way up the steps  On the first landing a glimmer of light came through a slit in the wall, and he saw a tiny man sitting there, without a head', " 'Ho! ho! my little fellow, what are you doing there?' asked Hans, and, without waiting for an answer, gave him a kick which sent him flying down the stairs", ' Then he climbed higher still, and finding as he went dumb watchers sitting on every landing, treated them as he had done the first  At last he reached the top, and as he paused for a moment to look round him he saw another headless man cowering in the very bell itself, waiting till Hans should seize the bell-pull in order to strike him a blow with the clapper, which would soon have made an end of him', " 'Stop, my little friend!' cried Hans", " 'That is not part of the bargain! Perhaps you saw how your comrades walked down stairs, and you are going after them", " But as you are in the highest place you shall make a more dignified exit, and follow them through the window!' With these words he began to climb the ladder, in order to take the little man from the bell and carry out his threat", " At this the dwarf cried out imploringly, 'Oh, brother! spare my life, and I promise that neither I nor my comrades will ever trouble you any more", ' I am small and weak, but who knows whether some day I shall not be able to reward you', "' 'You wretched little shrimp,' replied Hans, 'a great deal of good your gratitude is likely to do me! But as I happen to be feeling in a cheerful mood to-night I will let you have your life", " But take care how you come across me again, or you may not escape so easily!' The headless man thanked him humbly, slid hastily down the bell rope, and ran down the steps of the tower as if he had left a fire behind him" ,  ' A long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood in a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff  Of course the people had taken great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide which might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the town there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over the huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water  The branches of the tree itself were laden with fruit, and every day at sunrise a big grey monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost branches having his breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight  After he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the monkey swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the water  While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might perch comfortably he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy eyes', " 'Can I do anything for you, my friend?' asked the monkey politely", " 'Oh! if you only would thrown me down some of those delicious things, I should be so grateful,' answered the shark", " 'After you have lived on fish for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change", ' And I am so very, very tired of the taste of salt', "' 'Well, I don't like salt myself,' said the monkey; 'so if you will open your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it,' and, as he spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head", " But it was not so easy to hit the shark's mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and rolled into the water", ' However, the second time the monkey had better luck, and the fruit fell right in', " 'Ah, how good!' cried the shark", " 'Send me another, please", "' And the monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating them", " 'It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children,' he said, at length, 'but if you are here at the same time to-morrow I will give you another treat", "' 'Thank you, thank you,' said the shark, showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight; 'you can't guess how happy you have made me,' and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till the monkey came again", ' For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them  They became fast friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how to teach them all they ought to know  By and bye the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town, and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark  The shark perceived this very clearly, and described greater marvels, and the monkey as he listened grew more and more gloomy', " Matters were in this state when one day the shark said: 'I really hardly know how to thank you for all your kindness to me during these weeks", ' Here I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent to come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might happen to take your fancy', "' 'I should like nothing better,' cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as they always did when he was pleased", " 'But how could I get there? Not by water", " Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!' 'Oh! don't let that trouble you,' replied the shark, 'you have only to sit on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch you", "' So it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark swam close up under the tree and the monkey dropped neatly on his back, without even a splash", ' After a few minutes--for at first he felt a little frightened at his strange position--the monkey began to enjoy himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish and the sea-weeds and the oddly-shaped things that floated past them, and as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to himself', " The sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, 'My friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I should tell you something", "' 'What is it?' asked the monkey" ,  ' Sarah, the wife of the patriarch Abraham, and the great mother of the Jewish people, was the most beautiful woman who ever lived  Everybody who saw her marveled at the dazzling radiance of her countenance; they stood spellbound before the glorious light that shone in her eyes and the wondrous clearness of her complexion  This greatly troubled Abraham when he fled from Canaan to Egypt  It was disconcerting to have crowds of travelers gazing at his wife as if she were something more than human', " Besides, he feared that the Egyptians would seize Sarah for the king's harem", ' So, after much meditation, he concealed his wife in a big box  When he arrived at the Egyptian frontier, the customs officials asked him what it contained  "Barley," he replied  "You say that because the duty on barley is the lowest," they said  "The box must surely be packed with wheat " "I will pay the duty on wheat," said Abraham, who was most anxious they should not open the box  The officials were surprised, for, as a rule, people endeavored to avoid paying the duties  "If you are so ready to pay the higher tax," they said, "the box must contain something of greater value  Perhaps it contains spices " Abraham intimated his readiness to pay the duty on spices  "Oh, Oh!" laughed the officers  "Here is a strange person ready to pay heavy dues  He must be anxious to conceal something--gold, perchance " "I will pay the duty on gold," said Abraham, quietly  The officers were now completely bewildered  "Our highest duty," said their chief, "is on precious stones, and since you decline to open the box, we must demand the tax on the costliest gems " "I will pay it," said Abraham, simply  The officers could not understand this at all, and after consulting among themselves, they decided that the box must be opened  "It may contain something highly dangerous," they argued  Abraham protested, but he was arrested by the guards and the box forced open  When Sarah was revealed, the officials stepped back in amazement and admiration  "Indeed, a rare jewel," said the chief  It was immediately decided to send Sarah to the king  When Pharaoh beheld her, he was enraptured  She was simply dressed in the garments of a peasant woman, with no adornment and no jewels, and yet the king thought he had never seen a woman so entrancingly beautiful  It is well known that the good people cannot stand mean ways  Now, there once lived a house-wife who had a sharp eye to her own good in this world, and gave alms of what she had no use, for the good of her soul  One day a hill-man knocked at her door  "Can you lend us a saucepan, good mother?" said he  "There\'s a wedding in the hill, and all the pots are in use " "Is he to have one?" asked the servant girl who opened the door  "Ay, to be sure," said the house-wife  But when the maid was taking a saucepan from the shelf, she pinched her arm and whispered sharply, "Not that, you stupid; get the old one out of the cupboard  It leaks, and the hill-men are so neat and such nimble workers that they are sure to mend it before they send it home  So one does a good turn to the good people and saves sixpence from the tinker " The maid fetched the saucepan, which had been laid by till the tinker\'s next visit, and gave it to the dwarf, who thanked her and went away  The saucepan was soon returned neatly mended and ready for use', " At supper time the maid filled the pan with milk and set it on the fire for the children's supper, but in a few minutes the milk was so burnt and smoked that no one could touch it, and even the pigs would not drink the wash into which it was thrown", ' "Ah, you good-for-nothing slut!" cried the house-wife, as she this time filled the pan herself  "You would ruin the richest, with your careless ways; there\'s a whole quart of good milk spoilt at once " "And that\'s twopence," cried a voice from the chimney, a queer whining voice like some old body who was always grumbling over something  The house-wife had not left the saucepan for two minutes when the milk boiled over, and it was all burnt and smoked as before  "The pan must be dirty," cried the house-wife in a rage; "and there are two full quarts of milk as good as thrown to the dogs " "_And that\'s fourpence_," said the voice in the chimney  After a long scrubbing the saucepan was once more filled and set on the fire, but it was not the least use, the milk was burnt and smoked again, and the house-wife burst into tears at the waste, crying out, "Never before did such a thing happen to me since I kept house! Three quarts of milk burnt for one meal!" "_And that\'s sixpence,_" cried the voice from the chimney  "You didn\'t save the tinker after all," with which the hill-man himself came tumbling down the chimney, and went off laughing through the door  But from that time the saucepan was as good as any other     It is a great mistake to think that fairies, witches, magicians, and such people lived only in Eastern countries and in such times as those of the Caliph Haroun Al-Raschid  Fairies and their like belong to every country and every age, and no doubt we should see plenty of them now--if we only knew how  In a large town in Germany there lived, some couple of hundred years ago, a cobbler and his wife  They were poor and hard-working  The man sat all day in a little stall at the street corner and mended any shoes that were brought him  His wife sold the fruit and vegetables they grew in their garden in the Market Place, and as she was always neat and clean and her goods were temptingly spread out she had plenty of customers  The couple had one boy called Jem  A handsome, pleasant-faced boy of twelve, and tall for his age  He used to sit by his mother in the market and would carry home what people bought from her, for which they often gave him a pretty flower, or a slice of cake, or even some small coin  One day Jem and his mother sat as usual in the Market Place with plenty of nice herbs and vegetables spread out on the board, and in some smaller baskets early pears, apples, and apricots', " Jem cried his wares at the top of his voice: 'This way, gentlemen! See these lovely cabbages and these fresh herbs! Early apples, ladies; early pears and apricots, and all cheap", " Come, buy, buy!' As he cried an old woman came across the Market Place", ' She looked very torn and ragged, and had a small sharp face, all wrinkled, with red eyes, and a thin hooked nose which nearly met her chin  She leant on a tall stick and limped and shuffled and stumbled along as if she were going to fall on her nose at any moment  In this fashion she came along till she got to the stall where Jem and his mother were, and there she stopped', " 'Are you Hannah the herb seller?' she asked in a croaky voice as her head shook to and fro", " 'Yes, I am,' was the answer", " 'Can I serve you?' 'We'll see; we'll see! Let me look at those herbs", " I wonder if you've got what I want,' said the old woman as she thrust a pair of hideous brown hands into the herb basket, and began turning over all the neatly packed herbs with her skinny fingers, often holding them up to her nose and sniffing at them", " The cobbler's wife felt much disgusted at seeing her wares treated like this, but she dared not speak", " When the old hag had turned over the whole basket she muttered, 'Bad stuff, bad stuff; much better fifty years ago--all bad", "' This made Jem very angry 'You are a very rude old woman,' he cried out", " 'First you mess all our nice herbs about with your horrid brown fingers and sniff at them with your long nose till no one else will care to buy them, and then you say it's all bad stuff, though the duke's cook himself buys all his herbs from us", "' The old woman looked sharply at the saucy boy, laughed unpleasantly, and said: 'So you don't like my long nose, sonny? Well, you shall have one yourself, right down to your chin", "' As she spoke she shuffled towards the hamper of cabbages, took up one after another, squeezed them hard, and threw them back, muttering again, 'Bad stuff, bad stuff", "' 'Don't waggle your head in that horrid way,' begged Jem anxiously", " 'Your neck is as thin as a cabbage-stalk, and it might easily break and your head fall into the basket, and then who would buy anything?' 'Don't you like thin necks?' laughed the old woman", " 'Then you sha'n't have any, but a head stuck close between your shoulders so that it may be quite sure not to fall off", "' 'Don't talk such nonsense to the child,' said the mother at last", " 'If you wish to buy, please make haste, as you are keeping other customers away" ,  " In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper, and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies; and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur's Round Table", ' In those days there lived on St', " Michael's Mount, off Cornwall, a huge giant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round; his fierce and savage looks were the terror of all who beheld him", ' He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain, and used to wade over to the mainland in search of prey; when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist, and march back to his own abode  The giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy him', " Jack took a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern, and one winter's evening he went to the mount", ' There he dug a pit twenty-two feet deep and twenty broad  He covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground  He then blew his horn so loudly that the giant awoke and came out of his den crying out: "You saucy villain! you shall pay for this I\'ll broil you for my breakfast!" He had just finished, when, taking one step further, he tumbled headlong into the pit, and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him  Jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news  Another giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever he should have him in his power  This giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood; and some time after the death of Cormoran Jack was passing through a wood, and being weary, sat down and went to sleep  The giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, where he locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered with the bodies, skulls and bones of men and women  Soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant, to take a meal off his flesh; and Jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching  Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage, and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, and tied it to the window-bars; he then pulled till he had choked them  When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart  Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore, and went into the castle again  He made a strict search through all the rooms, and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads, and almost starved to death  They told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants, who had then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands  "Ladies," said Jack, "I have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother; and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains, to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt " He then very politely gave them the keys of the castle, and went further on his journey to Wales  As Jack had but little money, he went on as fast as possible  At length he came to a handsome house  Jack knocked at the door, when there came forth a Welsh giant  Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way, on which the giant made him welcome, and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in  Jack took off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could not go to sleep  Soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room, and saying to himself:  "Though here you lodge with me this night,  You shall not see the morning light;  My club shall dash your brains out quite " "Say you so?" thought Jack  "Are these your tricks upon travelers? But I hope to prove as cunning as you are " Then, getting out of bed, he groped about the room, and at last found a large thick billet of wood  Once there lived a farmer who had three daughters, and good useful girls they were, up with the sun, and doing all the work of the house  One morning they all ran down to the river to wash their clothes, when a hoodie came round and sat on a tree close by', " 'Wilt thou wed me, thou farmer's daughter?' he said to the eldest", " 'Indeed I won't wed thee,' she answered, 'an ugly brute is the hoodie", "' And the bird, much offended, spread his wings and flew away", " But the following day he came back again, and said to the second girl: 'Wilt thou wed me, farmer's daughter?' 'Indeed I will not,' answered she, 'an ugly brute is the hoodie", "' And the hoodie was more angry than before, and went away in a rage", " However, after a night's rest he was in a better temper, and thought that he might be more lucky the third time, so back he went to the old place", " 'Wilt thou wed me, farmer's daughter?' he said to the youngest", " 'Indeed I will wed thee; a pretty creature is the hoodie,' answered she, and on the morrow they were married", " 'I have something to ask thee,' said the hoodie when they were far away in his own house", " 'Wouldst thou rather I should be a hoodie by day and a man by night, or a man by day and a hoodie by night?' The girl was surprised at his words, for she did not know that he could be anything but a hoodie at all times", " Still she said nothing of this, and only replied, 'I would rather thou wert a man by day and a hoodie by night,' And so he was; and a handsomer man or a more beautiful hoodie never was seen", ' The girl loved them both, and never wished for things to be different  By and bye they had a son, and very pleased they both were  But in the night soft music was heard stealing close towards the house, and every man slept, and the mother slept also  When they woke again it was morning, and the baby was gone  High and low they looked for it, but nowhere could they find it, and the farmer, who had come to see his daughter, was greatly grieved, as he feared it might be thought that he had stolen it, because he did not want the hoodie for a son-in-law', " The next year the hoodie's wife had another son, and this time a watch was set at every door", ' But it was no use  In vain they determined that, come what might, they would not close their eyes; at the first note of music they all fell asleep, and when the farmer arrived in the morning to see his grandson, he found them all weeping, for while they had slept the baby had vanished', " Well, the next year it all happened again, and the hoodie's wife was so unhappy that her husband resolved to take her away to another house he had, and her sisters with her for company", " So they set out in a coach which was big enough to hold them, and had not gone very far when the hoodie suddenly said: 'You are sure you have not forgotten anything?' 'I have forgotten my coarse comb,' answered the wife, feeling in her pocket, and as she spoke the coach changed into a withered faggot, and the man became a hoodie again, and flew away", ' The two sisters returned home, but the wife followed the hoodie  Sometimes she would see him on a hill-top, and then would hasten after him, hoping to catch him  But by the time she had got to the top of the hill, he would be in the valley on the other side  When night came, and she was tired, she looked about for some place to rest, and glad she was to see a little house full of light straight in front of her, and she hurried towards it as fast as she could  At the door stood a little boy, and the sight of him filled her heart with pleasure, she did not know why  A woman came out, and bade her welcome, and set before her food, and gave her a soft bed to lie on', " And the hoodie's wife lay down, and so tired was she, that it seemed to her but a moment before the sun rose, and she awoke again" ,  ' A rich woman sat up late one night carding and preparing wool while all the family and servants were asleep  Suddenly a knock was given at the door, and a voice called out, "Open! Open!" "Who is there?" said the woman of the house  "I am the Witch of the One Horn," was answered  The mistress, supposing that one of her neighbours had called and required assistance, opened the door, and a woman entered, having in her hand a pair of wool carders, and bearing a horn on her forehead, as if growing there  She sat down by the fire in silence, and began to card the wool with violent haste  Suddenly she paused, and said aloud, "Where are the women; they delay too long?" Then a second knock came to the door, and a voice called as before, "Open! Open!" The mistress felt herself constrained to rise and open to the call, and immediately a second witch entered, having two horns on her forehead, and in her hand a wheel for spinning wool  "Give me place," she said; "I am the Witch of the Two Horns"; and she began to spin as quick as lightning  And so the knocks went on, and the call was heard and the witches entered, until at last twelve women sat round the fire--the first with one horn, the last with twelve horns  And they carded the thread and turned their spinning-wheels, and wound and wove  All singing together an ancient rhyme, but no word did they speak to the mistress of the house  Strange to hear and frightful to look upon were these twelve women, with their horns and their wheels; and the mistress felt near to death, and she tried to rise that she might call for help, but she could not move, nor could she utter a word or a cry, for the spell of the witches was upon her  Then one of them called to her in Irish, and said, "Rise, woman, and make us a cake " Then the mistress searched for a vessel to bring water from the well that she might mix the meal and make the cake, but she could find none  And they said to her, "Take a sieve, and bring water in it " And she took the sieve, and went to the well; but the water poured from it, and she could fetch none for the cake, and she sat down by the well and wept  Then came a voice by her, and said, "Take yellow clay and moss and bind them together, and plaster the sieve so that it will hold " This she did, and the sieve held the water for the cake; and the voice said again: "Return, and when thou comest to the north angle of the house cry aloud three times, and say, \'The mountain of the Fenian women and the sky over it is all on fire \'" And she did so  When the witches inside heard the call, a great and terrible cry broke from their lips, and they rushed forth with wild lamentations and shrieks, and fled away to Slievenamon, where was their chief abode  But the Spirit of the Well bade the mistress of the house to enter and prepare her home against the enchantments of the witches, if they returned again', " And first, to break their spells, she sprinkled the water in which she had washed her child's feet (the feet-water) outside the door on the threshold; secondly, she took the cake which the witches had made in her absence, of meal mixed with the blood drawn from the sleeping family, and she broke the cake in bits, and placed a bit in the mouth of each sleeper, and they were restored; and she took the cloth they had woven, and placed it half in and half out of the chest with the padlock; and, lastly, she secured the door with a great crossbeam fastened in the jambs, so that they could not enter, and having done these things she waited", ' Not long were the witches in coming, and they raged and called for vengeance  "Open! Open!" they screamed  "Open, feet-water!" "I cannot," said the feet-water; "I am scattered on the ground, and my path is down to the Lough " "Open, open, wood and trees and beam!" they cried to the door  "I cannot," said the door, "for the beam is fixed in the jambs, and I have no power to move " "Open, open, cake that we have made and mingled with blood!" they cried again  "I cannot," said the cake, "for I am broken and bruised, and my blood is on the lips of the sleeping children " Then the witches rushed through the air with great cries, and fled back to Slievenamon, uttering strange curses on the Spirit of the Well, who had wished their ruin', " But the woman and the house were left in peace, and a mantle dropped by one of the witches was kept hung up by the mistress as a sign of the night's awful contest; and this mantle was in possession of the same family from generation to generation for five hundred years after" ,  ' Many many years ago there lived a king and queen who had one only son, called Sigurd', " When the little boy was only ten years old the queen, his mother, fell ill and died, and the king, who loved her dearly, built a splendid monument to his wife's memory, and day after day he sat by it and bewailed his sad loss", ' One morning, as he sat by the grave, he noticed a richly dressed lady close to him  He asked her name and she answered that it was Ingiborg, and seemed surprised to see the king there all alone  Then he told her how he had lost his queen, and how he came daily to weep at her grave  In return, the lady informed him that she had lately lost her husband, and suggested that they might both find it a comfort if they made friends  This pleased the king so much that he invited her to his palace, where they saw each other often; and after a time he married her  After the wedding was over he soon regained his good spirits, and used to ride out hunting as in old days; but Sigurd, who was very fond of his stepmother, always stayed at home with her', " One evening Ingiborg said to Sigurd: 'To-morrow your father is going out hunting, and you must go with him", "' But Sigurd said he would much rather stay at home, and the next day when the king rode off Sigurd refused to accompany him", ' The stepmother was very angry, but he would not listen, and at last she assured him that he would be sorry for his disobedience, and that in future he had better do as he was told  After the hunting party had started she hid Sigurd under her bed, and bade him be sure to lie there till she called him  Sigurd lay very still for a long while, and was just thinking it was no good staying there any more, when he felt the floor shake under him as if there were an earthquake, and peeping out he saw a great giantess wading along ankle deep through the ground and ploughing it up as she walked', " 'Good morning, Sister Ingiborg,' cried she as she entered the room, 'is Prince Sigurd at home?' 'No,' said Ingiborg; 'he rode off to the forest with his father this morning", "' And she laid the table for her sister and set food before her", " After they had both done eating the giantess said: 'Thank you, sister, for your good dinner--the best lamb, the best can of beer and the best drink I have ever had; but--is not Prince Sigurd at home?' Ingiborg again said 'No'; and the giantess took leave of her and went away", ' When she was quite out of sight Ingiborg told Sigurd to come out of his hiding-place  The king returned home at night, but his wife told him nothing of what had happened, and the next morning she again begged the prince to go out hunting with his father  Sigurd, however, replied as before, that he would much rather stay at home  So once more the king rode off alone  This time Ingiborg hid Sigurd under the table, and scolded him well for not doing as she bade him  For some time he lay quite still, and then suddenly the floor began to shake, and a giantess came along wading half way to her knees through the ground', " As she entered the house she asked, as the first one had done: 'Well, Sister Ingiborg, is Prince Sigurd at home?' 'No,' answered Ingiborg,' he rode off hunting with his father this morning'; and going to the cupboard she laid the table for her sister", " When they had finished their meal the giantess rose and said: 'Thank you for all these nice dishes, and for the best lamb, the best can of beer and the nicest drink I have ever had; but--is Prince Sigurd really not at home?' 'No, certainly not!' replied Ingiborg; and with that they took leave of each other", ' When she was well out of sight Sigurd crept from under the table, and his stepmother declared that it was most important that he should not stay at home next day; but he said he did not see what harm could come of it, and he did not mean to go out hunting, and the next morning, when the king prepared to start, Ingiborg implored Sigurd to accompany his father  But it was all no use, he was quite obstinate and would not listen to a word she said', " 'You will have to hide me again,' said he, so no sooner had the king gone than Ingiborg hid Sigurd between the wall and the panelling, and by-and-by there was heard once more a sound like an earthquake, as a great giantess, wading knee deep through the ground, came in at the door", " 'Good day, Sister Ingiborg!' she cried, in a voice like thunder; 'is Prince Sigurd at home?' 'Oh, no,' answered Ingiborg, 'he is enjoying himself out there in the forest", ' I expect it will be quite dark before he comes back again', "' 'That's a lie!' shouted the giantess" ,  ' A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest', " One morning as he was going to his work, he said to his wife, 'Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood; and so that she shall not lose her way, I will take a bag of millet with me, and sprinkle the seed on the path", "' When the sun had risen high over the forest, the girl set out with a basin of soup", ' But the field and wood sparrows, the larks and finches, blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago, and the girl could not find her way  She went on and on, till the sun set and night came on  The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and she began to be very much frightened  Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees', " 'There must be people living yonder,' she thought, 'who will take me in for the night,' and she began walking towards it", ' Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows', " She knocked at the door, and a gruff voice called, 'Come in!' The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and tapped at the door of the room", " 'Just walk in,' cried the voice, and when she opened the door there sat an old gray-haired man at the table", ' His face was resting on his hands, and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground  By the stove lay three beasts, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow', " The girl told the old man her story, and asked for a night's lodging", " The man said:   Pretty cock,   Pretty hen,   And you, pretty brindled cow,   What do you say now? 'Duks,' answered the beasts; and that must have meant, 'We are quite willing,' for the old man went on, 'Here is abundance; go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper", "' The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen, and cooked a good meal, but she did not think of the beasts", ' She placed the full dishes on the table, sat down opposite the gray-haired man, and ate till her hunger was appeased', " When she was satisfied, she said, 'But now I am so tired, where is a bed in which I can sleep? ' The beasts answered:   You have eaten with him,   You have drunk with him,   Of us you have not thought,   Sleep then as you ought! Then the old man said, 'Go upstairs, and there you will find a bedroom; shake the bed, and put clean sheets on, and go to sleep", "' The maiden went upstairs, and when she had made the bed, she lay down", ' After some time the gray-haired man came, looked at her by the light of his candle, and shook his head  And when he saw that she was sound asleep, he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar  The woodcutter came home late in the evening, and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food', " 'No, I did not,' she answered; 'the girl went off with your dinner", ' She must have lost her way, but will no doubt come back to-morrow', "' But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the wood, and this time asked his second daughter to bring his food", " 'I will take a bag of lentils,' said he; 'they are larger than millet, and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way", "' At midday the maiden took the food, but the lentils had all gone; as on the previous day, the wood birds had eaten them all", " The maiden wandered about the wood till nightfall, when she came in the same way to the old man's house, and asked for food and a night's lodging", " The man with the white hair again asked the beasts:   Pretty cock,   Pretty hen,   And you, pretty brindled cow,   What do you say now? The beasts answered, 'Duks,' and everything happened as on the former day", ' The girl cooked a good meal, ate and drank with the old man, and did not trouble herself about the animals  Once upon a time there lived in Japan a rat and his wife who came of an old and noble race, and had one daughter, the loveliest girl in all the rat world  Her parents were very proud of her, and spared no pains to teach her all she ought to know  There was not another young lady in the whole town who was as clever as she was in gnawing through the hardest wood, or who could drop from such a height on to a bed, or run away so fast if anyone was heard coming  Great attention, too, was paid to her personal appearance, and her skin shone like satin, while her teeth were as white as pearls, and beautifully pointed  Of course, with all these advantages, her parents expected her to make a brilliant marriage, and, as she grew up, they began to look round for a suitable husband  But here a difficulty arose  The father was a rat from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail, outside as well as in, and desired that his daughter should wed among her own people', " She had no lack of lovers, but her father's secret hopes rested on a fine young rat, with moustaches which almost swept the ground, whose family was still nobler and more ancient than his own", ' Unluckily, the mother had other views for her precious child  She was one of those people who always despise their own family and surroundings, and take pleasure in thinking that they themselves are made of finer material than the rest of the world', " 'HER daughter should never marry a mere rat,' she declared, holding her head high", " 'With her beauty and talents she had a right to look for someone a little better than THAT", "' So she talked, as mothers will, to anyone that would listen to her", ' What the girl thought about the matter nobody knew or cared--it was not the fashion in the rat world  Many were the quarrels which the old rat and his wife had upon the subject, and sometimes they bore on their faces certain marks which looked as if they had not kept to words only', " 'Reach up to the stars is MY motto,' cried the lady one day, when she was in a greater passion than usual", " 'My daughter's beauty places her higher than anything upon earth,' she cried; 'and I am certainly not going to accept a son-in-law who is beneath her", "' 'Better offer her in marriage to the sun,' answered her husband impatiently", " 'As far as I know there is nothing greater than he", "' 'Well, I WAS thinking of it,' replied the wife, 'and as you are of the same mind, we will pay him a visit to-morrow", "' So the next morning, the two rats, having spent hours in making themselves smart, set out to see the sun, leading their daughter between them", ' The journey took some time, but at length they came to the golden palace where the sun lived', " 'Noble king,' began the mother, 'behold our daughter! She is so beautiful that she is above everything in the whole world", ' Naturally, we wish for a son-in-law who, on his side, is greater than all  Therefore we have come to you', "' 'I feel very much flattered,' replied the sun, who was so busy that he had not the least wish to marry anybody", " 'You do me great honour by your proposal", ' Only, in one point you are mistaken, and it would be wrong of me to take advantage of your ignorance  There is something greater than I am, and that is the cloud', " Look!' And as he spoke a cloud spread itself over the sun's face, blotting out his rays" ,  ' Outside in the forest there was deep snow  The white snow had crusted the branches of the pine trees, and piled itself up them till they bent under its weight  Now and then a snow-laden branch would bend too far, and huge lumps of snow fell crashing to the ground under the trees  Then the branch would swing up, and the snow covered it again with a cold white burden  Sitting in the hut you could hear the crashing again and again out in the forest, as the tired branches flung down their loads of snow  Yes, and now and then there was the howling of wolves far away  Little Maroosia heard them, and thought of them out there in the dark as they galloped over the snow  She sat closer to Vanya, her brother, and they were both as near as they could get to the door of the stove, where they could see the red fire burning busily, keeping the whole hut warm  The stove filled a quarter of the hut, but that was because it was a bed as well  There were blankets on it, and in those blankets Vanya and Maroosia rolled up and went to sleep at night, as warm as little baking cakes  The hut was made of pine logs cut from the forest  You could see the marks of the axe  Old Peter was the grandfather of Maroosia and Vanya  He lived alone with them in the hut in the forest, because their father and mother were both dead  Maroosia and Vanya could hardly remember them, and they were very happy with old Peter, who was very kind to them and did all he could to keep them warm and well fed  He let them help him in everything, even in stuffing the windows with moss to keep the cold out when winter began  The moss kept the light out too, but that did not matter  It would be all the jollier in the spring when the sun came pouring in  Besides old Peter and Maroosia and Vanya there were Vladimir and Bayan', " Vladimir was a cat, a big black cat, as stately as an emperor, and just now he was lying in Vanya's arms fast asleep", ' Bayan was a dog, a tall gray wolf-dog  He could jump over the table with a single bound  When he was in the hut he usually lay underneath the table, because that was the only place where he could lie without being in the way  And, of course at meal times he was in the way even there  Just now he was out with old Peter  "I wonder what story it will be to-night?" said Maroosia  "So do I," said Vanya  "I wish they\'d be quick and come back " Vladimir stirred suddenly in Vanya\'s lap, and a minute later they heard the scrunch of boots in the snow, and the stamping of old Peter\'s feet trying to get the snow off his boots  Then the door opened, and Bayan pushed his way in and shook himself, and licked Maroosia and Vanya and startled Vladimir, and lay down under the table and came out again, because he was so pleased to be home  Cat and Fox and Marionette walked and walked and walked  At last, toward evening, dead tired, they came to the Inn of the Red Lobster  "Let us stop here a while," said the Fox, "to eat a bite and rest for a few hours', " At midnight we'll start out again, for at dawn tomorrow we must be at the Field of Wonders", '" They went into the Inn and all three sat down at the same table  However, not one of them was very hungry  The poor Cat felt very weak, and he was able to eat only thirty-five mullets with tomato sauce and four portions of tripe with cheese  Moreover, as he was so in need of strength, he had to have four more helpings of butter and cheese  The Fox, after a great deal of coaxing, tried his best to eat a little  The doctor had put him on a diet, and he had to be satisfied with a small hare dressed with a dozen young and tender spring chickens  After the hare, he ordered some partridges, a few pheasants, a couple of rabbits, and a dozen frogs and lizards  That was all  He felt ill, he said, and could not eat another bite  Pinocchio ate least of all  He asked for a bite of bread and a few nuts and then hardly touched them  The poor fellow, with his mind on the Field of Wonders, was suffering from a gold-piece indigestion  Supper over, the Fox said to the Innkeeper: "Give us two good rooms, one for Mr  Pinocchio and the other for me and my friend', " Before starting out, we'll take a little nap", ' Remember to call us at midnight sharp, for we must continue on our journey " "Yes, sir," answered the Innkeeper, winking in a knowing way at the Fox and the Cat, as if to say, "I understand " As soon as Pinocchio was in bed, he fell fast asleep and began to dream  He dreamed he was in the middle of a field  The field was full of vines heavy with grapes  The grapes were no other than gold coins which tinkled merrily as they swayed in the wind  They seemed to say, "Let him who wants us take us!" Just as Pinocchio stretched out his hand to take a handful of them, he was awakened by three loud knocks at the door  It was the Innkeeper who had come to tell him that midnight had struck  "Are my friends ready?" the Marionette asked him  "Indeed, yes! They went two hours ago " "Why in such a hurry?" "Unfortunately the Cat received a telegram which said that his first-born was suffering from chilblains and was on the point of death  Once upon a time there lived a Fairy who had power over the earth, the sea, fire, and the air; and this Fairy had four sons  The eldest, who was quick and lively, with a vivid imagination, she made Lord of Fire, which was in her opinion the noblest of all the elements  To the second son, whose wisdom and prudence made amends for his being rather dull, she gave the government of the earth  The third was wild and savage, and of monstrous stature; and the Fairy, his mother, who was ashamed of his defects, hoped to hide them by creating him King of the Seas  The youngest, who was the slave of his passions and of a very uncertain temper, became Prince of the Air', " Being the youngest, he was naturally his mother's favourite; but this did not blind her to his weaknesses, and she foresaw that some day he would suffer much pain through falling in love", ' So she thought the best thing she could do was to bring him up with a horror of women; and, to her great delight, she saw this dislike only increased as he grew older  From his earliest childhood he heard nothing but stories of princes who had fallen into all sorts of troubles through love; and she drew such terrible pictures of poor little Cupid that the young man had no difficulty in believing that he was the root of all evil  All the time that this wise mother could spare from filling her son with hatred for all womenkind she passed in giving him a love of the pleasures of the chase, which henceforth became his chief joy  For his amusement she had made a new forest, planted with the most splendid trees, and turned loose in it every animal that could be found in any of the four quarters of the globe  In the midst of this forest she built a palace which had not its equal for beauty in the whole world, and then she considered that she had done enough to make any prince happy  Now it is all very well to abuse the God of Love, but a man cannot struggle against his fate', " In his secret heart the Prince got tired of his mother's constant talk on this subject; and when one day she quitted the palace to attend to some business, begging him never to go beyond the grounds, he at once jumped at the chance of disobeying her", ' Left to himself the Prince soon forgot the wise counsels of his mother, and feeling very much bored with his own company, he ordered some of the spirits of the air to carry him to the court of a neighbouring sovereign  This kingdom was situated in the Island of Roses, where the climate is so delicious that the grass is always green and the flowers always sweet  The waves, instead of beating on the rocks, seemed to die gently on the shore; clusters of golden bushes covered the land, and the vines were bent low with grapes  The King of this island had a daughter named Rosalie, who was more lovely than any girl in the whole world  No sooner had the eyes of the Prince of the Air rested on her than he forgot all the terrible woes which had been prophesied to him ever since he was born, for in one single moment the plans of years are often upset  He instantly began to think how best to make himself happy, and the shortest way that occurred to him was to have Rosalie carried off by his attendant spirits  It is easy to imagine the feelings of the King when he found that his daughter had vanished  He wept her loss night and day, and his only comfort was to talk over it with a young and unknown prince, who had just arrived at the Court  Alas! he did not know what a deep interest the stranger had in Rosalie, for he too had seen her, and had fallen a victim to her charms  One day the King, more sorrowful than usual, was walking sadly along the sea-shore, when after a long silence the unknown Prince, who was his only companion, suddenly spoke', " 'There is no evil without a remedy,' he said to the unhappy father; 'and if you will promise me your daughter in marriage, I will undertake to bring her back to you", "' 'You are trying to soothe me by vain promises,' answered the King", " 'Did I not see her caught up into the air, in spite of cries which would have softened the heart of any one but the barbarian who has robbed me of her? The unfortunate girl is pining away in some unknown land, where perhaps no foot of man has ever trod, and I shall see her no more", ' But go, generous stranger; bring back Rosalie if you can, and live happy with her ever after in this country, of which I now declare you heir', "' Although the stranger's name and rank were unknown to Rosalie's father, he was really the son of the King of the Golden Isle, which had for capital a city that extended from one sea to another", ' The walls, washed by the quiet waters, were covered with gold, which made one think of the yellow sands  Above them was a rampart of orange and lemon trees, and all the streets were paved with gold' ,  " Once upon a time when wishes came true there was a king's son who was enchanted by an old witch, so that he was obliged to sit in a large iron stove in a wood", ' There he lived for many years, and no one could free him', " At last a king's daughter came into the wood; she had lost her way, and could not find her father's kingdom again", ' She had been wandering round and round for nine days, and she came at last to the iron case', " A voice came from within and asked her, 'Where do you come from, and where do you want to go?' She answered, 'I have lost my way to my father's kingdom, and I shall never get home again", "' Then the voice from the iron stove said, 'I will help you to find your home again, and that in a very short time, if you will promise to do what I ask you", ' I am a greater prince than you are a princess, and I will marry you', "' Then she grew frightened, and thought, 'What can a young lassie do with an iron stove?' But as she wanted very much to go home to her father, she promised to do what he wished", " He said, 'You must come again, and bring a knife with you to scrape a hole in the iron", "' Then he gave her someone for a guide, who walked near her and said nothing, but he brought her in two hours to her house", ' There was great joy in the castle when the Princess came back, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her', " But she was very much troubled, and said, 'Dear father, listen to what has befallen me! I should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if I had not come to an iron stove, to whom I have had to promise that I will go back to free him and marry him!' The old King was so frightened that he nearly fainted, for she was his only daughter", " So they consulted together, and determined that the miller's daughter, who was very beautiful, should take her place", ' They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she must scrape at the iron stove  She scraped for twenty-four hours, but did not make the least impression', " When the day broke, a voice called from the iron stove, 'It seems to me that it is day outside", "' Then she answered, 'It seems so to me; I think I hear my father's mill rattling", "' 'So you are a miller's daughter! Then go away at once, and tell the King's daughter to come", "' Then she went away, and told the old King that the thing inside the iron stove would not have her, but wanted the Princess", ' The old King was frightened, and his daughter wept', " But they had a swineherd's daughter who was even more beautiful than the miller's daughter, and they gave her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the Princess", ' Then she was taken out, and had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours, but she could make no impression', " As soon as the day broke the voice from the stove called out, 'It seems to be daylight outside", "' Then she answered, 'It seems so to me too; I think I hear my father blowing his horn", "' 'So you are a swineherd's daughter! Go away at once, and let the King's daughter come", ' And say to her that what I foretell shall come to pass, and if she does not come everything in the kingdom shall fall into ruin, and not one stone shall be left upon another', "' When the Princess heard this she began to cry, but it was no good; she had to keep her word", ' She took leave of her father, put a knife in her belt, and went to the iron stove in the wood  As soon as she reached it she began to scrape, and the iron gave way and before two hours had passed she had made a little hole  Then she peeped in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot' ,  " One day a young prince was out practising archery with the son of his father's chief vizier, when one of the arrows accidentally struck the wife of a merchant, who was walking about in an upper room of a house close by", ' The prince aimed at a bird that was perched on the window-sill of that room, and had not the slightest idea that anybody was at hand, or he would not have shot in that direction', " Consequently, not knowing what had happened, he and the vizier's son walked away, the vizier's son chaffing him because he had missed the bird", ' Presently the merchant went to ask his wife about something, and found her lying, to all appearance, dead in the middle of the room, and an arrow fixed in the ground within half a yard of her head  Supposing that she was dead, he rushed to the window and shrieked, "Thieves thieves! They have killed my wife " The neighbours quickly gathered, and the servants came running upstairs to see what was the matter  It happened that the woman had fainted, and that there was only a very slight wound in her breast where the arrow had grazed  As soon as the woman recovered her senses she told them that two young men had passed by the place with their bows and arrows, and that one of them had most deliberately aimed at her as she stood by the window  On hearing this the merchant went to the king, and told him what had taken place  His Majesty was much enraged at such audacious wickedness, and swore that most terrible punishment should be visited on the offender if he could be discovered  He ordered the merchant to go back and ascertain whether his wife could recognise the young men if she saw them again  "Oh yes," replied the woman, "I should know them again among all the people in the city " "Then," said the king, when the merchant brought back this reply, "to-morrow I will cause all the male inhabitants of this city to pass before your house, and your wife will stand at the window and watch for the man who did this wanton deed " A royal proclamation was issued to this effect  So the next day all the men and boys of the city, from the age of ten years upwards, assembled and marched by the house of the merchant', " By chance (for they both had been excused from obeying this order) the king's son and the vizier's son were also in the company, and passed by in the crowd", ' They came to see the tamasha', " As soon as these two appeared in front of the merchant's window they were recognised by the merchant's wife, and at once reported to the king", ' "My own son and the son of my chief vizier!" exclaimed the king, who had been present from the commencement  "What examples for the people! Let them both be executed " "Not so, your Majesty," said the vizier, "I beseech you  Let the facts of the case be thoroughly investigated  How is it?" he continued, turning to the two young men  "Why have you done this cruel thing?" "I shot an arrow at a bird that was sitting on the sill of an open window in yonder house, and missed," answered the prince  "I suppose the arrow struck the merchant\'s wife  Had I known that she or anybody had been near I should not have shot in that direction " "We will speak of this later on," said the king, on hearing this answer  "Dismiss the people  Their presence is no longer needed " In the evening his Majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk about their two sons  There was once a dove who built a nice soft nest as a home for her three little ones  She was very proud of their beauty, and perhaps talked about them to her neighbours more than she need have done, till at last everybody for miles round knew where the three prettiest baby doves in the whole country-side were to be found', " One day a jackal who was prowling about in search of a dinner came by chance to the foot of the rock where the dove's nest was hidden away, and he suddenly bethought himself that if he could get nothing better he might manage to make a mouthful of one of the young doves", " So he shouted as loud as he could, 'Ohe, ohe, mother dove", "' And the dove replied, trembling with fear, 'What do you want, sir?' 'One of your children,' said he; 'and if you don't throw it to me I will eat up you and the others as well", "' Now, the dove was nearly driven distracted at the jackal's words; but, in order to save the lives of the other two, she did at last throw the little one out of the nest", ' The jackal ate it up, and went home to sleep', " Meanwhile the mother dove sat on the edge of her nest, crying bitterly, when a heron, who was flying slowly past the rock, was filled with pity for her, and stopped to ask, 'What is the matter, you poor dove?' And the dove answered, 'A jackal came by, and asked me to give him one of my little ones, and said that if I refused he would jump on my nest and eat us all up", "' But the heron replied, 'You should not have believed him", ' He could never have jumped so high  He only deceived you because he wanted something for supper', "' And with these words the heron flew off", ' He had hardly got out of sight when again the jackal came creeping slowly round the foot of the rock', " And when he saw the dove he cried out a second time, 'Ohe, ohe, mother dove! give me one of your little ones, or I will jump on your nest and eat you all up", "' This time the dove knew better, and she answered boldly, 'Indeed, I shall do nothing of the sort,' though her heart beat wildly with fear when she saw the jackal preparing for a spring", " However, he only cut himself against the rock, and thought he had better stick to threats, so he started again with his old cry, 'Mother dove, mother dove! be quick and give me one of your little ones, or I will eat you all up", "' But the mother dove only answered as before, 'Indeed, I shall do nothing of the sort, for I know we are safely out of your reach", "' The jackal felt it was quite hopeless to get what he wanted, and asked, 'Tell me, mother dove, how have you suddenly become so wise?' 'It was the heron who told me,' replied she", " 'And which way did he go?' said the jackal", " 'Down there among the reeds", " You can see him if you look,' said the dove", ' Then the jackal nodded good-bye, and went quickly after the heron  He soon came up to the great bird, who was standing on a stone on the edge of the river watching for a nice fat fish', " 'Tell me, heron,' said he, 'when the wind blows from that quarter, to which side do you turn?' 'And which side do you turn to?' asked the heron", " The jackal answered, 'I always turn to this side", "' 'Then that is the side I turn to,' remarked the heron", " 'And when the rain comes from that quarter, which side do you turn to?' And the heron replied, 'And which side do you turn to?' 'Oh, I always turn to this side,' said the jackal", " 'Then that is the side I turn to,' said the heron", " 'And when the rain comes straight down, what do you do?' 'What do you do yourself?' asked the heron", " 'I do this,' answered the jackal" ,  ' Long, long ago, in old Japan, the Kingdom of the Sea was governed by a wonderful King  He was called Rin Jin, or the Dragon King of the Sea  His power was immense, for he was the ruler of all sea creatures both great and small, and in his keeping were the Jewels of the Ebb and Flow of the Tide  The Jewel of the Ebbing Tide when thrown into the ocean caused the sea to recede from the land, and the Jewel of the Flowing Tide made the waves to rise mountains high and to flow in upon the shore like a tidal wave  The Palace of Rin Jin was at the bottom of the sea, and was so beautiful that no one has ever seen anything like it even in dreams  The walls were of coral, the roof of jadestone and chrysoprase, and the floors were of the finest mother-of-pearl  But the Dragon King, in spite of his wide-spreading Kingdom, his beautiful Palace and all its wonders, and his power which none disputed throughout the whole sea, was not at all happy, for he reigned alone  At last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier, but also more powerful  So he decided to take a wife  Calling all his fish retainers together, he chose several of them as ambassadors to go through the sea and seek for a young Dragon Princess who would be his bride  At last they returned to the Palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon  Her scales were of glittering green like the wings of summer beetles, her eyes threw out glances of fire, and she was dressed in gorgeous robes  All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them  The King fell in love with her at once, and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendor  Every living thing in the sea, from the great whales down to the little shrimps, came in shoals to offer their congratulations to the bride and bridegroom and to wish them a long and prosperous life  Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the Fish-World before', " The train of bearers who carried the bride's possessions to her new home seemed to reach across the waves from one end of the sea to the other", ' Each fish carried a phosphorescent lantern and was dressed in ceremonial robes, gleaming blue and pink and silver; and the waves as they rose and fell and broke that night seemed to be rolling masses of white and green fire, for the phosphorus shone with double brilliancy in honor of the event  Now for a time the Dragon King and his bride lived very happily  They loved each other dearly, and the bridegroom day after day took delight in showing his bride all the wonders and treasures of his coral Palace, and she was never tired of wandering with him through its vast halls and gardens', " Life seemed to them both like a long summer's day", ' Two months passed in this happy way, and then the Dragon Queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed  The King was sorely troubled when he saw his precious bride so ill, and at once sent for the fish doctor to come and give her some medicine', " He gave special orders to the servants to nurse her carefully and to wait upon her with diligence, but in spite of all the nurses' assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed, the young Queen showed no signs of recovery, but grew daily worse", ' Then the Dragon King interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the Queen', " The doctor was alarmed at Rin Jin's evident displeasure, and excused his want of skill by saying that although he knew the right kind of medicine to give the invalid, it was impossible to find it in the sea", ' "Do you mean to tell me that you can\'t get the medicine here?" asked the Dragon King  "It is just as you say!" said the doctor  "Tell me what it is you want for the Queen?" demanded Rin Jin  "I want the liver of a live monkey!" answered the doctor  In a charity school, among the children, sat a little Jewish girl  She was a good, intelligent child, and very quick at her lessons; but the Scripture-lesson class she was not allowed to join, for this was a Christian school  During the hour of this lesson, the Jewish girl was allowed to learn her geography, or to work her sum for the next day; and when her geography lesson was perfect, the book remained open before her, but she read not another word, for she sat silently listening to the words of the Christian teacher  He soon became aware that the little one was paying more attention to what he said than most of the other children  "Read your book, Sarah," he said to her gently  But again and again he saw her dark, beaming eyes fixed upon him; and once, when he asked her a question, she could answer him even better than the other children  She had not only heard, but understood his words, and pondered them in her heart  Her father, a poor but honest man, had placed his daughter at the school on the conditions that she should not be instructed in the Christian faith  But it might have caused confusion, or raised discontent in the minds of the other children if she had been sent out of the room, so she remained; and now it was evident this could not go on  The teacher went to her father, and advised him to remove his daughter from the school, or to allow her to become a Christian  "I cannot any longer be an idle spectator of those beaming eyes, which express such a deep and earnest longing for the words of the gospel," said he  Then the father burst into tears  "I know very little of the law of my fathers," said he; "but Sarah\'s mother was firm in her belief as a daughter of Israel, and I vowed to her on her deathbed that our child should never be baptized  I must keep my vow: it is to me even as a covenant with God Himself " And so the little Jewish girl left the Christian school  Years rolled by  In one of the smallest provincial towns, in a humble household, lived a poor maiden of the Jewish faith, as a servant  Her hair was black as ebony, her eye dark as night, yet full of light and brilliancy so peculiar to the daughters of the east  It was Sarah  The expression in the face of the grown-up maiden was still the same as when, a child, she sat on the schoolroom form listening with thoughtful eyes to the words of the Christian teacher  Every Sunday there sounded forth from a church close by the tones of an organ and the singing of the congregation  The Jewish girl heard them in the house where, industrious and faithful in all things, she performed her household duties  "Thou shalt keep the Sabbath holy," said the voice of the law in her heart; but her Sabbath was a working day among the Christians, which was a great trouble to her  And then as the thought arose in her mind, "Does God reckon by days and hours?" her conscience felt satisfied on this question, and she found it a comfort to her, that on the Christian Sabbath she could have an hour for her own prayers undisturbed  The music and singing of the congregation sounded in her ears while at work in her kitchen, till the place itself became sacred to her  Then she would read in the Old Testament, that treasure and comfort to her people, and it was indeed the only Scriptures she could read  Faithfully in her inmost thoughts had she kept the words of her father to her teacher when she left the school, and the vow he had made to her dying mother that she should never receive Christian baptism  The New Testament must remain to her a sealed book, and yet she knew a great deal of its teaching, and the sound of the gospel truths still lingered among the recollections of her childhood  One evening she was sitting in a corner of the dining-room, while her master read aloud  It was not the gospel he read, but an old story-book; therefore she might stay and listen to him  Once upon a time there came to the ancient city of Rahmatabad a jogi of holy appearance, who took up his abode under a tree outside the city, where he would sit for days at a time fasting from food and drink, motionless except for the fingers that turned restlessly his string of beads  The fame of such holiness as this soon spread, and daily the citizens would flock to see him, eager to get his blessing, to watch his devotions, or to hear his teaching, if he were in the mood to speak  Very soon the rajah himself heard of the jogi, and began regularly to visit him to seek his counsel and to ask his prayers that a son might be vouchsafed to him  Days passed by, and at last the rajah became so possessed with the thought of the holy man that he determined if possible to get him all to himself  So he built in the neighbourhood a little shrine, with a room or two added to it, and a small courtyard closely walled up; and, when all was ready, besought the jogi to occupy it, and to receive no other visitors except himself and his queen and such pupils as the jogi might choose, who would hand down his teaching', " To this the jogi consented; and thus he lived for some time upon the king's bounty, whilst the fame of his godliness grew day by day", ' Now, although the rajah of Rahmatabad had no son, he possessed a daughter, who as she grew up became the most beautiful creature that eye ever rested upon  Her father had long before betrothed her to the son of the neighbouring rajah of Dilaram, but as yet she had not been married to him, and lived the quiet life proper to a maiden of her beauty and position  The princess had of course heard of the holy man and of his miracles and his fasting, and she was filled with curiosity to see and to speak to him; but this was difficult, since she was not allowed to go out except into the palace grounds, and then was always closely guarded', " However, at length she found an opportunity, and made her way one evening alone to the hermit's shrine", ' Unhappily, the hermit was not really as holy as he seemed; for no sooner did he see the princess than he fell in love with her wonderful beauty, and began to plot in his heart how he could win her for his wife  But the maiden was not only beautiful, she was also shrewd; and as soon as she read in the glance of the jogi the love that filled his soul, she sprang to her feet, and, gathering her veil about her, ran from the place as fast as she could  The jogi tried to follow, but he was no match for her; so, beside himself with rage at finding that he could not overtake her, he flung at her a lance, which wounded her in the leg  The brave princess stooped for a second to pluck the lance out of the wound, and then ran on until she found herself safe at home again  There she bathed and bound up the wound secretly, and told no one how naughty she had been, for she knew that her father would punish her severely  Next day, when the king went to visit the jogi, the holy man would neither speak to nor look at him', " 'What is the matter?' asked the king", " 'Won't you speak to me to-day?' 'I have nothing to say that you would care to hear,' answered the jogi", " 'Why?' said the king", " 'Surely you know that I value all that you say, whatever it may be", "' But still the jogi sat with his face turned away, and the more the king pressed him the more silent and mysterious he became", " At last, after much persuasion, he said: 'Let me tell you, then, that there is in this city a creature which, if you do not put an end to it, will kill every single person in the place", "' The king, who was easily frightened, grew pale", " 'What?' he gasped--'what is this dreadful thing? How am I to know it and to catch it? Only counsel me and help me, and I will do all that you advise", "' 'Ah!' replied the jogi, 'it is indeed dreadful", ' It is in the shape of a beautiful girl, but it is really an evil spirit  Last evening it came to visit me, and when I looked upon it its beauty faded into hideousness, its teeth became horrible fangs, its eyes glared like coals of fire, great claws sprang from its slender fingers, and were I not what I am it might have consumed me', "' The king could hardly speak from alarm, but at last he said: 'How am I to distinguish this awful thing when I see it?' 'Search,' said the jogi, 'for a lovely girl with a lance wound in her leg, and when she is found secure her safely and come and tell me, and I will advise you what to do next", "' Away hurried the king, and soon set all his soldiers scouring the country for a girl with a lance wound in her left", ' For two days the search went on, and then it was somehow discovered that the only person with a lance wound in the leg was the princess herself  The Flea, the Grasshopper, and the Skipjack once wanted to see which of them could jump highest; and they invited the whole world, and whoever else would come, to see the grand sight  And there the three famous jumpers were met together in the room  "Yes, I\'ll give my daughter to him who jumps highest," said the King, "for it would be mean to let these people jump for nothing " The Flea stepped out first', " He had very pretty manners, and bowed in all directions, for he had young ladies' blood in his veins, and was accustomed to consort only with human beings; and that was of great consequence", ' Then came the Grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier, but he had a good figure, and wore the green uniform that was born with him  This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly esteemed there  He had just come from the field, he said, and had been put into a card house three stories high, and all made of picture cards with the figures turned inwards  There were doors and windows in the house, cut in the body of the Queen of Hearts  "I sing so," he said, "that sixteen native crickets who have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card house of their own, would become thinner than they are with envy if they were to hear me " Both of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care to announce who they were, and that they considered themselves entitled to marry a Princess  The Skipjack said nothing, but it was said of him that he thought all the more; and directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him he was ready to assert that the Skipjack was of good family, and formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose', " The old councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue, declared that the Skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one; and that's more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac", ' "I shall not say anything more," said the old King  "I only go on quietly, and always think the best " Now they were to take their jump  The Flea sprang so high that no one could see him; and then they asserted that he had not jumped at all  That was very mean', " The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King's face, and the King declared that was horribly rude", ' The Skipjack stood a long time considering; at last people thought that he could not jump at all  "I only hope he\'s not become unwell," said the Yard Dog, and then he smelt at him again  "Tap!" he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the lap of the Princess, who sat on a low golden stool  Then the King said, "The highest leap was taken by him who jumped up to my daughter; for therein lies the point; but it requires head to achieve that, and the Skipjack has shown that he has a head " And so he had the Princess  "I jumped highest, after all," said the Flea  "But it\'s all the same  Let her have the goose-bone with its lump of wax and bit of stick  I jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is required if one wishes to be seen " And the Flea went into foreign military service, where it is said he was killed  The Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought and considered how things happened in the world  Mr  H---- R----, when he was alive, used to live a good deal in Dublin, and he was once a great while out of the country on account of the "ninety-eight" business  But the servants kept on in the big house at Rath---- all the same as if the family was at home  Well, they used to be frightened out of their lives, after going to their beds, with the banging of the kitchen door and the clattering of fire-irons and the pots and plates and dishes  One evening they sat up ever so long keeping one another in heart with stories about ghosts and that, when--what would you have of it?--the little scullery boy that used to be sleeping over the horses, and could not get room at the fire, crept into the hot hearth, and when he got tired listening to the stories, sorra fear him, but he fell dead asleep  Well and good  After they were all gone, and the kitchen raked up, he was woke with the noise of the kitchen door opening, and the trampling of an ass on the kitchen floor  He peeped out, and what should he see but a big ass, sure enough, sitting on his curabingo and yawning before the fire  After a little he looked about him, and began scratching his ears as if he was quite tired, and says he, "I may as well begin first as last " The poor boy\'s teeth began to chatter in his head, for, says he, "Now he\'s going to ate me"; but the fellow with the long ears and tail on him had something else to do  He stirred the fire, and then he brought in a pail of water from the pump, and filled a big pot that he put on the fire before he went out  He then put in his hand--foot, I mean--into the hot hearth, and pulled out the little boy  He let a roar out of him with the fright; but the pooka only looked at him, and thrust out his lower lip to show how little he valued him, and then he pitched him into his pew again', " Well, he then lay down before the fire till he heard the boil coming on the water, and maybe there wasn't a plate, or a dish, or a spoon on the dresser that he didn't fetch and put in the pot, and wash and dry the whole bilin' of 'em as well as e'er a kitchen maid from that to Dublin town", " He then put all of them up on their places on the shelves; and if he didn't give a good sweepin' to the kitchen, leave it till again", ' Then he comes and sits fornent the boy, let down one of his ears, and cocked up the other, and gave a grin', " The poor fellow strove to roar out, but not a dheeg 'ud come out of his throat", " The last thing the pooka done was to rake up the fire and walk out, giving such a slap o' the door that the boy thought the house couldn't help tumbling down", " Well, to be sure, if there wasn't a hullabuloo next morning when the poor fellow told his story! They could talk of nothing else the whole day", ' One said one thing, another said another, but a fat, lazy scullery girl said the wittiest thing of all  "Musha!" says she, "if the pooka does be cleaning up everything that way when we are asleep, what should we be slaving ourselves for doing his work?" "_Sha gu dheine_," says another, "them\'s the wisest words you ever said, Kauth; it\'s meeself won\'t contradict you " So said, so done  Not a bit of a plate or dish saw a drop of water that evening, and not a besom was laid on the floor, and everyone went to bed soon after sundown  Next morning everything was as fine as fine in the kitchen, and the lord mayor might eat his dinner off the flags  It was great ease to the lazy servants, you may depend, and everything went on well till a foolhardy gag of a boy said he would stay up one night and have a chat with the pooka  He was a little daunted when the door was thrown open and the ass marched up to the fire  "And then, sir," says he at last, picking up courage, "if it isn\'t taking a liberty, might I ax who you are, and why you are so kind as to do half of the day\'s work for the girls every night?" "No liberty at all," says the pooka, says he: "I\'ll tell you, and welcome', " I was a servant in the time of Squire R----'s father, and was the laziest rogue that ever was clothed and fed, and done nothing for it", ' When my time came for the other world, this is the punishment was laid on me to come here and do all this labour every night, and then go out in the cold', " It isn't so bad in the fine weather; but if you only knew what it is to stand with your head between your legs, facing the storm from midnight to sunrise, on a bleak winter night" ,  ' The next morning the sun rose so bright that Irene said the rain had washed his face and let the light out clean  The torrents were still roaring down the side of the mountain, but they were so much smaller as not to be dangerous in the daylight  After an early breakfast, Peter went to his work and Curdie and his mother set out to take the princess home', " They had difficulty in getting her dry across the streams, and Curdie had again and again to carry her, but at last they got safe on the broader part of the road, and walked gently down towards the king's house", " And what should they see as they turned the last corner but the last of the king's troop riding through the gate! 'Oh, Curdie!' cried Irene, clapping her hands right joyfully,'my king-papa is come", "' The moment Curdie heard that, he caught her up in his arms, and set off at full speed, crying: 'Come on, mother dear! The king may break his heart before he knows that she is safe", "' Irene clung round his neck and he ran with her like a deer", ' When he entered the gate into the court, there sat the king on his horse, with all the people of the house about him, weeping and hanging their heads', " The king was not weeping, but his face was white as a dead man's, and he looked as if the life had gone out of him", ' The men-at-arms he had brought with him sat with horror-stricken faces, but eyes flashing with rage, waiting only for the word of the king to do something--they did not know what, and nobody knew what  The day before, the men-at-arms belonging to the house, as soon as they were satisfied the princess had been carried away, rushed after the goblins into the hole, but found that they had already so skilfully blockaded the narrowest part, not many feet below the cellar, that without miners and their tools they could do nothing  Not one of them knew where the mouth of the mine lay, and some of those who had set out to find it had been overtaken by the storm and had not even yet returned  Poor Sir Walter was especially filled with shame, and almost hoped the king would order his head to be cut off, for to think of that sweet little face down amongst the goblins was unendurable', " When Curdie ran in at the gate with the princess in his arms, they were all so absorbed in their own misery and awed by the king's presence and grief, that no one observed his arrival", ' He went straight up to the king, where he sat on his horse', " 'Papa! papa!' the princess cried, stretching out her arms to him; 'here I am!' The king started", ' The colour rushed to his face  He gave an inarticulate cry  Curdie held up the princess, and the king bent down and took her from his arms  As he clasped her to his bosom, the big tears went dropping down his cheeks and his beard  And such a shout arose from all the bystanders that the startled horses pranced and capered, and the armour rang and clattered, and the rocks of the mountain echoed back the noises', " The princess greeted them all as she nestled in her father's bosom, and the king did not set her down until she had told them all the story", " But she had more to tell about Curdie than about herself, and what she did tell about herself none of them could understand--except the king and Curdie, who stood by the king's knee stroking the neck of the great white horse", ' And still as she told what Curdie had done, Sir Walter and others added to what she told, even Lootie joining in the praises of his courage and energy', " Curdie held his peace, looking quietly up in the king's face", " And his mother stood on the outskirts of the crowd listening with delight, for her son's deeds were pleasant in her ears, until the princess caught sight of her", " 'And there is his mother, king-papa!' she said", " 'See--there", " She is such a nice mother, and has been so kind to me!' They all parted asunder as the king made a sign to her to come forward", ' She obeyed, and he gave her his hand, but could not speak' ,  " When O'Conor was King over Ireland he was living in Rathcroghan, of Connacht", ' He had one son, but he, when he grew up, was wild, and the King could not control him, because he would have his own will in everything  One morning he went out--  His hound at his foot,  And his hawk on his hand,  And his fine black horse to bear him-- and he went forward, singing a verse of a song to himself, until he came as far as a big bush that was growing on the brink of a glen  There was a grey old man sitting at the foot of the bush, and he said, "King\'s son, if you are able to play as well as you are able to sing songs, I would like to play a game with you " The King\'s son thought that it was a silly old man that was in it, and he alighted, threw bridle over branch, and sat down by the side of the grey old man  The old man drew out a pack of cards and asked, "Can you play these?" "I can," said the King\'s son  "What shall we play for?" said the grey old man  "Anything you wish," says the King\'s son  "All right; if I win you must do for me anything I shall ask of you, and if you win I must do for you anything you ask of me," says the grey old man  "I\'m satisfied," says the King\'s son', " They played the game, and the King's son beat the grey old man", ' Then he said, "What would you like me to do for you, King\'s son?" "I won\'t ask you to do anything for me," says the King\'s son  "I think that you are not able to do much " "Don\'t mind that," said the old man  "You must ask me to do something', " I never lost a bet yet that I wasn't able to pay it", '" As I said, the King\'s son thought that it was a silly old man that was in it, and to satisfy him he said to him, "Take the head off my stepmother and put a goat\'s head on her for a week " "I\'ll do that for you," said the grey old man', " The King's son went a-riding on his horse--  His hound at his foot,  His hawk on his hand-- and he faced for another place, and never thought more about the grey old man until he came home", ' He found a cry and great grief in the castle', " The servants told him that an enchanter had come into the room where the Queen was, and had put a goat's head on her in place of her own head", ' "By my hand, but that\'s a wonderful thing," says the King\'s son  "If I had been at home I\'d have whipt the head off him with my sword " There was great grief on the King, and he sent for a wise councillor, and asked him did he know how the thing happened to the Queen  "Indeed, I cannot tell you that," said he; "it\'s a work of enchantment " The King\'s son did not let on that he had any knowledge of the matter, but on the morrow morning he went out--  His hound at his foot,  His hawk on his hand,  And his fine black horse to bear him-- and he never drew rein until he came as far as the big bush on the brink of the glen  The grey old man was sitting there under the bush, and said, "King\'s son, will you have a game to-day?" The King\'s son got down and said, "I will " With that he threw bridle over branch and sat down by the side of the old man', " He drew out the cards and asked the King's son did he get the thing he had won yesterday", ' "That\'s all right," said the King\'s son  The King of the Polar Bears lived among the icebergs in the far north country  He was old and monstrous big; he was wise and friendly to all who knew him  His body was thickly covered with long, white hair that glistened like silver under the rays of the midnight sun  His claws were strong and sharp, that he might walk safely over the smooth ice or grasp and tear the fishes and seals upon which he fed  The seals were afraid when he drew near, and tried to avoid him; but the gulls, both white and gray, loved him because he left the remnants of his feasts for them to devour  Often his subjects, the polar bears, came to him for advice when ill or in trouble; but they wisely kept away from his hunting grounds, lest they might interfere with his sport and arouse his anger  The wolves, who sometimes came as far north as the icebergs, whispered among themselves that the King of the Polar Bears was either a magician or under the protection of a powerful fairy  For no earthly thing seemed able to harm him; he never failed to secure plenty of food, and he grew bigger and stronger day by day and year by year  Yet the time came when this monarch of the north met man, and his wisdom failed him  He came out of his cave among the icebergs one day and saw a boat moving through the strip of water which had been uncovered by the shifting of the summer ice  In the boat were men  The great bear had never seen such creatures before, and therefore advanced toward the boat, sniffing the strange scent with aroused curiosity and wondering whether he might take them for friends or foes, food or carrion  When the king came near the water\'s edge a man stood up in the boat and with a queer instrument made a loud "bang!" The polar bear felt a shock; his brain became numb; his thoughts deserted him; his great limbs shook and gave way beneath him and his body fell heavily upon the hard ice  That was all he remembered for a time  When he awoke he was smarting with pain on every inch of his huge bulk, for the men had cut away his hide with its glorious white hair and carried it with them to a distant ship  Above him circled thousands of his friends the gulls, wondering if their benefactor were really dead and it was proper to eat him  But when they saw him raise his head and groan and tremble they knew he still lived, and one of them said to his comrades: "The wolves were right  The king is a great magician, for even men cannot kill him  But he suffers for lack of covering  Let us repay his kindness to us by each giving him as many feathers as we can spare " This idea pleased the gulls  One after another they plucked with their beaks the softest feathers from under their wings, and, flying down, dropped then gently upon the body of the King of the Polar Bears  Then they called to him in a chorus: "Courage, friend! Our feathers are as soft and beautiful as your own shaggy hair  They will guard you from the cold winds and warm you while you sleep  Have courage, then, and live!" And the King of the Polar Bears had courage to bear his pain and lived and was strong again  The feathers grew as they had grown upon the bodies of the birds and covered him as his own hair had done  Mostly they were pure white in color, but some from the gray gulls gave his majesty a slight mottled appearance  The rest of that summer and all through the six months of night the king left his icy cavern only to fish or catch seals for food  He felt no shame at his feathery covering, but it was still strange to him, and he avoided meeting any of his brother bears  During this period of retirement he thought much of the men who had harmed him, and remembered the way they had made the great "bang!" And he decided it was best to keep away from such fierce creatures  When the young king of Easaidh Ruadh came into his kingdom, the first thing he thought of was how he could amuse himself best  The sports that all his life had pleased him best suddenly seemed to have grown dull, and he wanted to do something he had never done before  At last his face brightened', " 'I know!' he said", " 'I will go and play a game with the Gruagach", "' Now the Gruagach was a kind of wicked fairy, with long curly brown hair, and his house was not very far from the king's house", " But though the king was young and eager, he was also prudent, and his father had told him on his deathbed to be very careful in his dealings with the 'good people,' as the fairies were called", ' Therefore before going to the Gruagach the king sought out a wise man of the countryside', " 'I am wanting to play a game with the curly-haired Gruagach,' said he", " 'Are you, indeed?' replied the wizard", " 'If you will take my counsel, you will play with someone else", "' 'No; I will play with the Gruagach,' persisted the king", " 'Well, if you must, you must, I suppose,' answered the wizard; 'but if you win that game, ask as a prize the ugly crop-headed girl that stands behind the door", "' 'I will,' said the king", ' So before the sun rose he got up and went to the house of the Gruagach, who was sitting outside', " 'O king, what has brought you here to-day?' asked the Gruagach", " 'But right welcome you are, and more welcome will you be still if you will play a game with me", "' 'That is just what I want,' said the king, and they played; and sometimes it seemed as if one would win, and sometimes the other, but in the end it was the king who was the winner", " 'And what is the prize that you will choose?' inquired the Gruagach", " 'The ugly crop-headed girl that stands behind the door,' replied the king", " 'Why, there are twenty others in the house, and each fairer than she!' exclaimed the Gruagach", " 'Fairer they may be, but it is she whom I wish for my wife, and none other,' and the Gruagach saw that the king's mind was set upon her, so he entered his house, and bade all the maidens in it come out one by one, and pass before the king", " One by one they came; tall and short, dark and fair, plump and thin, and each said 'I am she whom you want", ' You will be foolish indeed if you do not take me', "' But he took none of them, neither short nor tall, dark nor fair, plump nor thin, till at the last the crop-headed girl came out", " 'This is mine,' said the king, though she was so ugly that most men would have turned from her", " 'We will be married at once, and I will carry you home", "' And married they were, and they set forth across a meadow to the king's house", " As they went, the bride stooped and picked a sprig of shamrock, which grew amongst the grass, and when she stood upright again her ugliness had all gone, and the most beautiful woman that ever was seen stood by the king's side", ' The next day, before the sun rose, the king sprang from his bed, and told his wife he must have another game with the Gruagach  Fifty years ago there lived a king who was very anxious to get married; but, as he was quite determined that his wife should be as beautiful as the sun, the thing was not so easy as it seemed, for no maiden came up to his standard  Then he commanded a trusty servant to search through the length and breadth of the land till he found a girl fair enough to be queen, and if he had the good luck to discover one he was to bring her back with him  The servant set out at once on his journey, and sought high and low-in castles and cottages; but though pretty maidens were plentiful as blackberries, he felt sure that none of them would please the king  One day he had wandered far and wide, and was feeling very tired and thirsty  By the roadside stood a tiny little house, and here he knocked and asked for a cup of water  Now in this house dwelt two sisters, and one was eighty and the other ninety years old  They were very poor, and earned their living by spinning', " This had kept their hands very soft and white, like the hands of a girl, and when the water was passed through the lattice, and the servant saw the small, delicate fingers, he said to himself: 'A maiden must indeed be lovely if she has a hand like that", "' And he made haste back, and told the king", " 'Go back at once,' said his majesty, 'and try to get a sight of her", "' The faithful servant departed on his errand without losing any time, and again he knocked at the door of the little house and begged for some water", ' As before, the old woman did not open the door, but passed the water through the lattice', " 'Do you live here alone?' asked the man", " 'No,' replied she, 'my sister lives with me", ' We are poor girls, and have to work for our bread', "' 'How old are you?' 'I am fifteen, and she is twenty", "' Then the servant went back to the king, and told him all he knew", " And his majesty answered: 'I will have the fifteen-year-old one", ' Go and bring her here', "' The servant returned a third time to the little house and knocked at the door", ' In reply to his knock the lattice window was pushed open, and a voice inquired what it was he wanted', " 'The king has desired me to bring back the youngest of you to become his queen,' he replied", " 'Tell his majesty I am ready to do his bidding, but since my birth no ray of light has fallen upon my face", ' If it should ever do so I shall instantly grow black  Therefore beg, I pray you, his most gracious majesty to send this evening a shut carriage, and I will return in it to the castle  When the king heard this he ordered his great golden carriage to be prepared, and in it to be placed some magnificent robes; and the old woman wrapped herself in a thick veil, and was driven to the castle  The king was eagerly awaiting her, and when she arrived he begged her politely to raise her veil and let him see her face', " But she answered: 'Here the tapers are too bright and the light too strong", " Would you have me turn black under your very eyes?' And the king believed her words, and the marriage took place without the veil being once lifted", ' Afterwards, when they were alone, he raised the corner, and knew for the first time that he had wedded a wrinkled old woman  Long ago, a poor widow woman lived down near the iron forge, by Enniscorth, and she was so poor she had no clothes to put on her son; so she used to fix him in the ash-hole, near the fire, and pile the warm ashes about him; and according as he grew up, she sunk the pit deeper  At last, by hook or by crook, she got a goat-skin, and fastened it round his waist, and he felt quite grand, and took a walk down the street  So says she to him next morning, "Tom, you thief, you never done any good yet, and you six foot high, and past nineteen;--take that rope and bring me a faggot from the wood " "Never say\'t twice, mother," says Tom--"here goes " When he had it gathered and tied, what should come up but a big giant, nine foot high, and made a lick of a club at him  Well become Tom, he jumped a-one side, and picked up a ram-pike; and the first crack he gave the big fellow, he made him kiss the clod  "If you have e\'er a prayer," says Tom, "now\'s the time to say it, before I make fragments of you " "I have no prayers," says the giant; "but if you spare my life I\'ll give you that club; and as long as you keep from sin, you\'ll win every battle you ever fight with it " Tom made no bones about letting him off; and as soon as he got the club in his hands, he sat down on the bresna, and gave it a tap with the kippeen, and says, "Faggot, I had great trouble gathering you, and run the risk of my life for you, the least you can do is to carry me home " And sure enough, the wind o\' the word was all it wanted', " It went off through the wood, groaning and crackling, till it came to the widow's door", ' Well, when the sticks were all burned, Tom was sent off again to pick more; and this time he had to fight with a giant that had two heads on him', " Tom had a little more trouble with him--that's all; and the prayers he said, was to give Tom a fife; that nobody could help dancing when he was playing it", ' Begonies, he made the big faggot dance home, with himself sitting on it  The next giant was a beautiful boy with three heads on him', " He had neither prayers nor catechism no more nor the others; and so he gave Tom a bottle of green ointment, that wouldn't let you be burned, nor scalded, nor wounded", ' "And now," says he, "there\'s no more of us  You may come and gather sticks here till little Lunacy Day in Harvest, without giant or fairy-man to disturb you " Well, now, Tom was prouder nor ten paycocks, and used to take a walk down street in the heel of the evening; but some o\' the little boys had no more manners than if they were Dublin jackeens, and put out their tongues at Tom\'s club and Tom\'s goat-skin', " He didn't like that at all, and it would be mean to give one of them a clout", " At last, what should come through the town but a kind of a bellman, only it's a big bugle he had, and a huntsman's cap on his head, and a kind of a painted shirt", " So this--he wasn't a bellman, and I don't know what to call him--bugleman, maybe, proclaimed that the King of Dublin's daughter was so melancholy that she didn't give a laugh for seven years, and that her father would grant her in marriage to whoever could make her laugh three times", ' "That\'s the very thing for me to try," says Tom; and so, without burning any more daylight, he kissed his mother, curled his club at the little boys, and off he set along the yalla highroad to the town of Dublin  At last Tom came to one of the city gates, and the guards laughed and cursed at him instead of letting him in  Tom stood it all for a little time, but at last one of them--out of fun, as he said--drove his bayonet half an inch or so into his side', " Tom done nothing but take the fellow by the scruff o' the neck and the waistband of his corduroys, and fling him into the canal", ' Some run to pull the fellow out, and others to let manners into the vulgarian with their swords and daggers; but a tap from his club sent them headlong into the moat or down on the stones, and they were soon begging him to stay his hands  So at last one of them was glad enough to show Tom the way to the palace-yard; and there was the king, and the queen, and the princess, in a gallery, looking at all sorts of wrestling, and sword-playing, and long-dances, and mumming, all to please the princess; but not a smile came over her handsome face', " Well, they all stopped when they seen the young giant, with his boy's face, and long black hair, and his short curly beard--for his poor mother couldn't afford to buy razors--and his great strong arms, and bare legs, and no covering but the goat-skin that reached from his waist to his knees", " But an envious wizened bit of a fellow, with a red head, that wished to be married to the princess, and didn't like how she opened her eyes at Tom, came forward, and asked his business very snappishly" ,  ' In the centre of the great hall in the castle of Caerleon upon Usk, king Arthur sat on a seat of green rushes, over which was thrown a covering of flame-coloured silk, and a cushion of red satin lay under his elbow  With him were his knights Owen and Kynon and Kai, while at the far end, close to the window, were Guenevere the queen and her maidens embroidering white garments with strange devices of gold', " 'I am weary,' said Arthur, 'and till my food is prepared I would fain sleep", ' You yourselves can tell each other tales, and Kai will fetch you from the kitchen a flagon of mean and some meat', "' And when they had eaten and drunk, Kynon, the oldest among them, began his story", " 'I was the only son of my father and mother, and much store they set by me, but I was not content to stay with them at home, for I thought no deed in all the world was too mighty for me", ' None could hold me back, and after I had won many adventures in my own land, I bade farewell to my parents and set out to see the world  Over mountains, through deserts, across rivers I went, till I reached a fair valley full of trees, with a path running by the side of a stream', " I walked along that path all the day, and in the evening I came to a castle in front of which stood two youths clothed in yellow, each grasping an ivory bow, with arrows made of the bones of the whale, and winged with peacock's feathers", ' By their sides hung golden daggers with hilts of the bones of the whale', " 'Near these young men was a man richly dressed, who turned and went with me towards the castle, where all the dwellers were gathered in the hall", ' In one window I beheld four and twenty damsels, and the least fair of them was fairer than Guenevere at her fairest  Some took my horse, and others unbuckled my armour, and washed it, with my sword and spear, till it all shone like silver  Then I washed myself and put on a vest and doublet which they brought me, and I and the man that entered with me sat down before a table of silver, and a goodlier feast I never had', " 'All this time neither the man nor the damsels had spoken one word, but when our dinner was half over, and my hunger was stilled, the man began to ask who I was", " Then I told him my name and my father's name, and why I came there, for indeed I had grown weary of gaining the mastery over all men at home, and sought if perchance there was one who could gain the mastery over me", ' And at this the man smiled and answered: \'"If I did not fear to distress thee too much, I would show thee what thou seekest " His words made me sorrowful and fearful of myself, which the man perceived, and added, "If thou meanest truly what thou sayest, and desirest earnestly to prove thy valour, and not to boast vainly that none can overcome thee, I have somewhat to show thee  But to-night thou must sleep in the this castle, and in the morning see that thou rise early and follow the road upwards through the valley, until thou reachest a wood  In the wood is a path branching to the right; go along this path until thou comest to a space of grass with a mound in the middle of it  On the top of the mound stands a black man, larger than any two white men; his eye is in the centre of his forehead and he has only one foot  He carries a club of iron, and two white men could hardly lift it  Around him graze a thousand beasts, all of different kinds, for he is the guardian of that wood, and it is he who will tell thee which way to go in order to find the adventure thou art in quest of " \'So spake the man, and long did that night seem to me, and before dawn I rose and put on my armour, and mounted my horse and rode on till I reached the grassy space of which he had told me  There was the black man on top of the mound, as he had said, and in truth he was mightier in all ways than I had thought him to be  As for the club, Kai, it would have been a burden for four of our warriors  He waited for me to speak, and I asked him what power he held over the beasts that thronged so close about him  \'"I will show thee, little man," he answered, and with his club he struck a stag on the head till he brayed loudly  And at his braying the animals came running, numerous as the stars in the sky, so that scarce was I able to stand among them  Serpents were there also, and dragons, and beasts of strange shapes, with horns in places where never saw I horns before  Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly  Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: "Lambikin! Lambikin! I\'ll EAT YOU!" But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:   "To Granny\'s house I go,   Where I shall fatter grow,   Then you can eat me so " The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass  By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: "Lambikin! Lambikin! I\'ll EAT YOU!" But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:   "To Granny\'s house I go,   Where I shall fatter grow,   Then you can eat me so " The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass  And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said: "Lambikin! Lambikin! I\'ll EAT YOU!" But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:   "To Granny\'s house I go,   Where I shall fatter grow,   Then you can eat me so " At last he reached his Granny\'s house, and said, all in a great hurry, "Granny, dear, I\'ve promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin _at once_ " So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home  But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender  "I\'ll tell you what you must do," said Master Lambikin, "you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I\'m as tight as a drum myself " So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother\'s skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily  Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:   "Drumikin! Drumikin!   Have you seen Lambikin?" And Mr  Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:   "Fallen into the fire, and so will you   On little Drumikin  Tum-pa, tum-too!" "How very annoying!" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip  Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:   "Tum-pa, tum-too;   Tum-pa, tum-too!" Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:   "Drumikin! Drumikin!   Have you seen Lambikin?" And to each of them the little slyboots replied:   "Fallen into the fire, and so will you   On little Drumikin  Tum-pa, tum too;   Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!" Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip  At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out--   "Drumikin! Drumikin!   Have you seen Lambikin?" And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:   "Fallen into the fire, and so will you   On little Drumikin! Tum-pa----" But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at once, and cried: "Hullo! you\'ve turned yourself inside out, have you? Just you come out of that!" Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin     Once upon a time a man had a shepherd who served him many years faithfully and honestly  One day, whilst herding his flock, this shepherd heard a hissing sound, coming out of the forest near by, which he could not account for  So he went into the wood in the direction of the noise to try to discover the cause  When he approached the place he found that the dry grass and leaves were on fire, and on a tree, surrounded by flames, a snake was coiled, hissing with terror  The shepherd stood wondering how the poor snake could escape, for the wind was blowing the flames that way, and soon that tree would be burning like the rest', " Suddenly the snake cried: 'O shepherd! for the love of heaven save me from this fire!' Then the shepherd stretched his staff out over the flames and the snake wound itself round the staff and up to his hand, and from his hand it crept up his arm, and twined itself about his neck", " The shepherd trembled with fright, expecting every instant to be stung to death, and said: 'What an unlucky man I am! Did I rescue you only to be destroyed myself?' But the snake answered: 'Have no fear; only carry me home to my father who is the King of the Snakes", "' The shepherd, however, was much too frightened to listen, and said that he could not go away and leave his flock alone; but the snake said: 'You need not be afraid to leave your flock, no evil shall befall them; but make all the haste you can", "' So he set off through the wood carrying the snake, and after a time he came to a great gateway, made entirely of snakes intertwined one with another", ' The shepherd stood still with surprise, but the snake round his neck whistled, and immediately all the arch unwound itself', " 'When we are come to my father's house,' said his own snake to him, 'he will reward you with anything you like to ask--silver, gold, jewels, or whatever on this earth is most precious; but take none of all these things, ask rather to understand the language of beasts", ' He will refuse it to you a long time, but in the end he will grant it to you', "' Soon after that they arrived at the house of the King of the Snakes, who burst into tears of joy at the sight of his daughter, as he had given her up for dead", " 'Where have you been all this time?' he asked, directly he could speak, and she told him that she had been caught in a forest fire, and had been rescued from the flames by the shepherd", " The King of the Snakes, then turning to the shepherd, said to him: 'What reward will you choose for saving my child?' 'Make me to know the language of beasts,' answered the shepherd, 'that is all I desire", "' The king replied: 'Such knowledge would be of no benefit to you, for if I granted it to you and you told any one of it, you would immediately die; ask me rather for whatever else you would most like to possess, and it shall be yours", "' But the shepherd answered him: 'Sir, if you wish to reward me for saving your daughter, grant me, I pray you, to know the language of beasts", " I desire nothing else'; and he turned as if to depart", " Then the king called him back, saying: 'If nothing else will satisfy you, open your mouth", "' The man obeyed, and the king spat into it, and said: 'Now spit into my mouth", "' The shepherd did as he was told, then the King of the Snakes spat again into the shepherd's mouth", " When they had spat into each other's mouths three times, the king said: 'Now you know the language of beasts, go in peace; but, if you value your life, beware lest you tell any one of it, else you will immediately die", "' So the shepherd set out for home, and on his way through the wood he heard and understood all that was said by the birds, and by every living creature", ' When he got back to his sheep he found the flock grazing peacefully, and as he was very tired he laid himself down by them to rest a little', " Hardly had he done so when two ravens flew down and perched on a tree near by, and began to talk to each other in their own language: 'If that shepherd only knew that there is a vault full of gold and silver beneath where that lamb is lying, what would he not do?' When the shepherd heard these words he went straight to his master and told him, and the master at once took a waggon, and broke open the door of the vault, and they carried off the treasure", " But instead of keeping it for himself, the master, who was an honourable man, gave it all up to the shepherd, saying: 'Take it, it is yours", ' The gods have given it to you', "' So the shepherd took the treasure and built himself a house", ' He married a wife, and they lived in great peace and happiness, and he was acknowledged to be the richest man, not only of his native village, but of all the country-side  He had flocks of sheep, and cattle, and horses without end, as well as beautiful clothes and jewels  Suddenly they stopped before a little house, which looked very miserable  The roof reached to the ground; and the door was so low, that the family were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in or out  Nobody was at home except an old Lapland woman, who was dressing fish by the light of an oil lamp', " And the Reindeer told her the whole of Gerda's history, but first of all his own; for that seemed to him of much greater importance", ' Gerda was so chilled that she could not speak  "Poor thing," said the Lapland woman, "you have far to run still  You have more than a hundred miles to go before you get to Finland; there the Snow Queen has her country-house, and burns blue lights every evening  I will give you a few words from me, which I will write on a dried haberdine, for paper I have none; this you can take with you to the Finland woman, and she will be able to give you more information than I can " When Gerda had warmed herself, and had eaten and drunk, the Lapland woman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine, begged Gerda to take care of them, put her on the Reindeer, bound her fast, and away sprang the animal  "Ddsa! Ddsa!" was again heard in the air; the most charming blue lights burned the whole night in the sky, and at last they came to Finland  They knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman; for as to a door, she had none  There was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went about almost naked  She was diminutive and dirty', " She immediately loosened little Gerda's clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and boots; for otherwise the heat would have been too great--and after laying a piece of ice on the Reindeer's head, read what was written on the fish-skin", ' She read it three times: she then knew it by heart; so she put the fish into the cupboard--for it might very well be eaten, and she never threw anything away  Then the Reindeer related his own story first, and afterwards that of little Gerda; and the Finland woman winked her eyes, but said nothing  "You are so clever," said the Reindeer; "you can, I know, twist all the winds of the world together in a knot  If the seaman loosens one knot, then he has a good wind; if a second, then it blows pretty stiffly; if he undoes the third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests are upturned  Will you give the little maiden a potion, that she may possess the strength of twelve men, and vanquish the Snow Queen?" "The strength of twelve men!" said the Finland woman  "Much good that would be!" Then she went to a cupboard, and drew out a large skin rolled up  When she had unrolled it, strange characters were to be seen written thereon; and the Finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration trickled down her forehead  But the Reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked so imploringly with tearful eyes at the Finland woman, that she winked, and drew the Reindeer aside into a corner, where they whispered together, while the animal got some fresh ice put on his head  "\'Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen\'s, and finds everything there quite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the world; but the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye, and in his heart  These must be got out first; otherwise he will never go back to mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him " "But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue her with power over the whole?" "I can give her no more power than what she has already', " Don't you see how great it is? Don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve her; how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear of her power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is a sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by herself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her", ' Two miles hence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the little girl', " Set her down by the large bush with red berries, standing in the snow; don't stay talking, but hasten back as fast as possible", '" And now the Finland woman placed little Gerda on the Reindeer\'s back, and off he ran with all imaginable speed  "Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!" cried little Gerda  All the rest went up the mountain, and separated in groups to the homes of the miners  Curdie and his father and mother took Lootie with them  And the whole way a light, of which all but Lootie understood the origin, shone upon their path  But when they looked round they could see nothing of the silvery globe', " For days and days the water continued to rush from the doors and windows of the king's house, and a few goblin bodies were swept out into the road", ' Curdie saw that something must be done  He spoke to his father and the rest of the miners, and they at once proceeded to make another outlet for the waters', " By setting all hands to the work, tunnelling here and building there, they soon succeeded; and having also made a little tunnel to drain the water away from under the king's house, they were soon able to get into the wine cellar, where they found a multitude of dead goblins--among the rest the queen, with the skin-shoe gone, and the stone one fast to her ankle--for the water had swept away the barricade, which prevented the men-at-arms from following the goblins, and had greatly widened the passage", ' They built it securely up, and then went back to their labours in the mine  A good many of the goblins with their creatures escaped from the inundation out upon the mountain  But most of them soon left that part of the country, and most of those who remained grew milder in character, and indeed became very much like the Scotch brownies  Their skulls became softer as well as their hearts, and their feet grew harder, and by degrees they became friendly with the inhabitants of the mountain and even with the miners', " But the latter were merciless to any of the cobs' creatures that came in their way, until at length they all but disappeared", ' The rest of the history of The Princess and Curdie must be kept for another volume      In the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far from the open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree  It was just three hundred and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to the tree as the same number of days might be to us; we wake by day and sleep by night, and then we have our dreams  It is different with the tree; it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and does not get any sleep till winter comes  Winter is its time for rest; its night after the long day of spring, summer, and autumn  On many a warm summer, the Ephemera, the flies that exist for only a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt happy and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures rested on one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say, "Poor little creature! your whole life consists only of a single day  How very short  It must be quite melancholy " "Melancholy! what do you mean?" the little creature would always reply  "Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous " "But only for one day, and then it is all over " "Over!" repeated the fly; "what is the meaning of all over? Are you all over too?" "No; I shall very likely live for thousands of your days, and my day is whole seasons long; indeed it is so long that you could never reckon it out " "No? then I don\'t understand you  You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy  Does all the beauty of the world cease when you die?" "No," replied the tree; "it will certainly last much longer,--infinitely longer than I can even think of " "Well, then," said the little fly, "we have the same time to live; only we reckon differently " And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly  The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment  Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass, nodded its little head as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and sweetly  The fly was dead  "Poor little Ephemera!" said the oak; "what a terribly short life!" And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given  The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy  The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the noon of summer, and the evening of autumn; its time of rest, its night drew nigh--winter was coming  Already the storms were singing, "Good-night, good-night " Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf  "We will rock you and lull you  Go to sleep, go to sleep  We will sing you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will do your old twigs good; they will even crackle with pleasure  Sleep sweetly, sleep sweetly, it is your three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth night  Correctly speaking, you are but a youngster in the world  Sleep sweetly, the clouds will drop snow upon you, which will be quite a cover-lid, warm and sheltering to your feet  We are in a rich, happy house, where the master, the servants, the friends of the family are full of joy and felicity  For on this day a son and heir has been born, and mother and child are doing well  The lamp in the bed-chamber had been partly shaded, and the windows were covered with heavy curtains of some costly silken material  The carpet was thick and soft, like a covering of moss  Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and blessing  The guardian angel of the house leaned against the head of the bed; while over the child was spread, as it were, a net of shining stars, and each star was a pearl of happiness  All the good stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born; here sparkled health, wealth, fortune, and love; in short, there seemed to be everything for which man could wish on earth  "Everything has been bestowed here," said the guardian angel  "No, not everything," said a voice near him--the voice of the good angel of the child; "one fairy has not yet brought her gift, but she will, even if years should elapse, she will bring her gift; it is the last pearl that is wanting " "Wanting!" cried the guardian angel; "nothing must be wanting here; and if it is so, let us fetch it; let us seek the powerful fairy; let us go to her " "She will come, she will come some day unsought!" "Her pearl must not be missing; it must be there, that the crown, when worn, may be complete  Where is she to be found? Where does she dwell?" said the guardian angel  "Tell me, and I will procure the pearl " "Will you do that?" replied the good angel of the child  "Then I will lead you to her directly, wherever she may be', " She has no abiding place; she rules in the palace of the emperor, sometimes she enters the peasant's humble cot; she passes no one without leaving a trace of her presence", ' She brings her gift with her, whether it is a world or a bauble  To this child she must come  You think that to wait for this time would be long and useless  Well, then, let us go for this pearl--the only one lacking amidst all this wealth " Then hand-in-hand they floated away to the spot where the fairy was now lingering  It was in a large house with dark windows and empty rooms, in which a peculiar stillness reigned  A whole row of windows stood open, so that the rude wind could enter at its pleasure, and the long white curtains waved to and fro in the current of air  In the centre of one of the rooms stood an open coffin, in which lay the body of a woman, still in the bloom of youth and very beautiful  Fresh roses were scattered over her  The delicate folded hands and the noble face glorified in death by the solemn, earnest look, which spoke of an entrance into a better world, were alone visible', " Around the coffin stood the husband and children, a whole troop, the youngest in the father's arms", ' They were come to take a last farewell look of their mother  The husband kissed her hand, which now lay like a withered leaf, but which a short time before had been diligently employed in deeds of love for them all  Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken  On one of the upper branches of the Congo river lived an ancient and aristocratic family of hippopotamuses, which boasted a pedigree dating back beyond the days of Noah--beyond the existence of mankind--far into the dim ages when the world was new  They had always lived upon the banks of this same river, so that every curve and sweep of its waters, every pit and shallow of its bed, every rock and stump and wallow upon its bank was as familiar to them as their own mothers  And they are living there yet, I suppose  Not long ago the queen of this tribe of hippopotamuses had a child which she named Keo, because it was so fat and round  Still, that you may not be misled, I will say that in the hippopotamus language "Keo," properly translated, means "fat and lazy" instead of fat and round', " However, no one called the queen's attention to this error, because her tusks were monstrous long and sharp, and she thought Keo the sweetest baby in the world", ' He was, indeed, all right for a hippopotamus  He rolled and played in the soft mud of the river bank, and waddled inland to nibble the leaves of the wild cabbage that grew there, and was happy and contented from morning till night  And he was the jolliest hippopotamus that ancient family had ever known  His little red eyes were forever twinkling with fun, and he laughed his merry laugh on all occasions, whether there was anything to laugh at or not  Therefore the black people who dwelt in that region called him "Ippi"--the jolly one, although they dared not come anigh him on account of his fierce mother, and his equally fierce uncles and aunts and cousins, who lived in a vast colony upon the river bank  And while these black people, who lived in little villages scattered among the trees, dared not openly attack the royal family of hippopotamuses, they were amazingly fond of eating hippopotamus meat whenever they could get it  This was no secret to the hippopotamuses  And, again, when the blacks managed to catch these animals alive, they had a trick of riding them through the jungles as if they were horses, thus reducing them to a condition of slavery  Therefore, having these things in mind, whenever the tribe of hippopotamuses smelled the oily odor of black people they were accustomed to charge upon them furiously, and if by chance they overtook one of the enemy they would rip him with their sharp tusks or stamp him into the earth with their huge feet  It was continual warfare between the hippopotamuses and the black people  Gouie lived in one of the little villages of the blacks  He was the son of the chief\'s brother and grandson of the village sorcerer, the latter being an aged man known as the "the boneless wonder," because he could twist himself into as many coils as a serpent and had no bones to hinder his bending his flesh into any position  This made him walk in a wabbly fashion, but the black people had great respect for him', " Gouie's hut was made of branches of trees stuck together with mud, and his clothing consisted of a grass mat tied around his middle", ' But his relationship to the chief and the sorcerer gave him a certain dignity, and he was much addicted to solitary thought  Perhaps it was natural that these thoughts frequently turned upon his enemies, the hippopotamuses, and that he should consider many ways of capturing them  Finally he completed his plans, and set about digging a great pit in the ground, midway between two sharp curves of the river  When the pit was finished he covered it over with small branches of trees, and strewed earth upon them, smoothing the surface so artfully that no one would suspect there was a big hole underneath  Then Gouie laughed softly to himself and went home to supper  That evening the queen said to Keo, who was growing to be a fine child for his age: "I wish you\'d run across the bend and ask your Uncle Nikki to come here  I have found a strange plant, and want him to tell me if it is good to eat " The jolly one laughed heartily as he started upon his errand, for he felt as important as a boy does when he is sent for the first time to the corner grocery to buy a yeast cake  "Guk-uk-uk-uk! guk-uk-uk-uk!" was the way he laughed; and if you think a hippopotamus does not laugh this way you have but to listen to one and you will find I am right  He crawled out of the mud where he was wallowing and tramped away through the bushes, and the last his mother heard as she lay half in and half out of the water was his musical "guk-uk-uk-uk!" dying away in the distance  A Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Leap-frog once wanted to see which could jump highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else besides who chose to come to see the festival  Three famous jumpers were they, as everyone would say, when they all met together in the room  "I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest," exclaimed the King; "for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for " The Flea was the first to step forward  He had exquisite manners, and bowed to the company on all sides; for he had noble blood, and was, moreover, accustomed to the society of man alone; and that makes a great difference  Then came the Grasshopper  He was considerably heavier, but he was well-mannered, and wore a green uniform, which he had by right of birth; he said, moreover, that he belonged to a very ancient Egyptian family, and that in the house where he then was, he was thought much of  The fact was, he had been just brought out of the fields, and put in a pasteboard house, three stories high, all made of court-cards, with the colored side inwards; and doors and windows cut out of the body of the Queen of Hearts  "I sing so well," said he, "that sixteen native grasshoppers who have chirped from infancy, and yet got no house built of cards to live in, grew thinner than they were before for sheer vexation when they heard me " It was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper gave an account of themselves, and thought they were quite good enough to marry a Princess  The Leap-frog said nothing; but people gave it as their opinion, that he therefore thought the more; and when the housedog snuffed at him with his nose, he confessed the Leap-frog was of good family  The old councillor, who had had three orders given him to make him hold his tongue, asserted that the Leap-frog was a prophet; for that one could see on his back, if there would be a severe or mild winter, and that was what one could not see even on the back of the man who writes the almanac  "I say nothing, it is true," exclaimed the King; "but I have my own opinion, notwithstanding " Now the trial was to take place  The Flea jumped so high that nobody could see where he went to; so they all asserted he had not jumped at all; and that was dishonorable', " The Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into the King's face, who said that was ill-mannered", ' The Leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought; it was believed at last he would not jump at all  "I only hope he is not unwell," said the house-dog; when, pop! he made a jump all on one side into the lap of the Princess, who was sitting on a little golden stool close by  Hereupon the King said, "There is nothing above my daughter; therefore to bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made; but for this, one must possess understanding, and the Leap-frog has shown that he has understanding  He is brave and intellectual " And so he won the Princess  "It\'s all the same to me," said the Flea  "She may have the old Leap-frog, for all I care  I jumped the highest; but in this world merit seldom meets its reward  A fine exterior is what people look at now-a-days " The Flea then went into foreign service, where, it is said, he was killed  The Grasshopper sat without on a green bank, and reflected on worldly things; and he said too, "Yes, a fine exterior is everything--a fine exterior is what people care about " And then he began chirping his peculiar melancholy song, from which we have taken this history; and which may, very possibly, be all untrue, although it does stand here printed in black and white      There was once a poor man who lived in the fertile glen of Aherlow, at the foot of the gloomy Galtee mountains, and he had a great hump on his back; he looked just as if his body had been rolled up and placed upon his shoulders; and his head was pressed down with the weight so much that his chin, when he was sitting, used to rest upon his knees for support  The country people were rather shy of meeting him in any lonesome place, for though, poor creature, he was as harmless and as inoffensive as a new-born infant, yet his deformity was so great that he scarcely appeared to be a human creature, and some ill-minded persons had set strange stories about him afloat  He was said to have a great knowledge of herbs and charms; but certain it was that he had a mighty skilful hand in plaiting straws and rushes into hats and baskets, which was the way he made his livelihood  Lusmore, for that was the nickname put upon him, by reason of his always wearing a sprig of the fairy cap, or lusmore (the foxglove), in his little straw hat, would ever get a higher penny for his plaited work than anyone else, and perhaps that was the reason why someone, out of envy, had circulated the strange stories about him  Be that as it may, it happened that he was returning one evening from the pretty town of Cahir towards Cappagh, and as little Lusmore walked very slowly, on account of the great hump upon his back, it was quite dark when he came to the old moat of Knockgrafton, which stood on the right-hand side of the road', " Tired and weary was he, and no ways comfortable in his own mind at thinking how much farther he had to travel, and that he should be walking all the night; so he sat down under the moat to rest himself, and began looking mournfully enough upon the moon, which--  Rising in clouded majesty at length  Apparent Queen, unveil'd her peerless light,  And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw", ' Presently there arose a wild strain of unearthly melody upon the ear of little Lusmore  He listened, and he thought that he had never heard such ravishing music before', " It was like the sound of many voices, each mingling and blending with the others so strangely that they seemed to be one, though all singing different strains, and the words of the songs were these:  Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort,                  Da Luan, Da Mort; when there would be a moment's pause, and then the round of melody went on again", ' Lusmore listened attentively, scarcely drawing his breath, lest he might lose the slightest note  He now plainly perceived that the singing was within the moat; and though at first it had charmed him much, he began to get tired of hearing the same round sung over and over so often without any change; so, availing himself of the pause when Da Luan, Da Mort, had been sung three times, he took up the tune, and raised it with the words augus Da Dardeen, and then went on singing with the voices inside of the moat, Da Luan, Da Mort, finishing the melody, when the pause came again, with augus Da Dardeen  The fairies within Knockgrafton, for the song was a fairy melody, when they heard this addition to the tune, were so much delighted that with instant resolve it was determined to bring the mortal among them whose musical skill so far exceeded theirs, and little Lusmore was conveyed into their company with the eddying speed of a whirlwind  Glorious to behold was the sight that burst upon him as he came down through the moat, twirling round and round, with the lightness of a straw, to the sweetest music, that kept time to his motion', " The greatest honour was then paid him, for he was put above all the musicians, and he had servants tending upon him and everything to his heart's content, and a hearty welcome to all; and, in short, he was made as much of as if he had been the first man in the land", ' Presently Lusmore saw a great consultation going on among the fairies, and, notwithstanding all their civility, he felt very much frightened, until one, stepping out from the rest, came up to him and said:  Lusmore! Lusmore!  Doubt not, nor deplore,  For the hump which you bore  On your back is no more;  Look down on the floor,  And view it, Lusmore! When these words were said, poor little Lusmore felt himself so light and so happy that he thought he could have bounded at one jump over the moon, like the cow in the history of the cat and the fiddle; and he saw, with inexpressible pleasure, his hump tumble down upon the ground from his shoulders  He then tried to lift up his head, and did so with becoming caution, fearing that he might knock it against the ceiling of the great hall where he was  He looked round and round again with the greatest wonder and delight upon everything, which appeared more and more beautiful; and, overpowered at beholding such a resplendent scene, his head grew dizzy and his eyesight grew dim  At last he fell into a sound sleep, and when he awoke he found that it was broad daylight, the sun shining brightly, and the birds singing sweetly, and that he was lying just at the foot of Knockgrafton, with the cows and sheep grazing peaceably about him  The first thing Lusmore did, after saying his prayers, was to put his hand behind to feel for his hump, but no sign of one was there on his back, and he looked at himself with great pride, for he had now become a well-shaped, dapper little fellow, and, more than that, found himself in a full suit of new clothes, which he concluded the fairies had made for him  Towards Cappagh he went, stepping out as lightly and springing up at every step as if he had been all his life a dancing-master  Not a creature who met Lusmore knew him without his hump, and he had a great work to persuade everyone that he was the same man--in truth he was not as far as the outward appearance went', " Of course it was not long before the story of Lusmore's hump got about, and a great wonder was made of it", ' Through the country for miles round it was the talk of everyone, high and low  One morning, as Lusmore was sitting, contented enough, at his cabin door, up came an old woman to him, and asked him if he could direct her to Cappagh  "I need give you no directions, my good woman," said Lusmore, "for this is Cappagh  And whom may you want here?" "I have come," said the woman, "out of Decies country, in the county of Waterford, looking after one Lusmore, who, I have heard tell, had his hump taken off by the fairies; for there is a son of a gossip of mine who has got a hump on him that will be his death; and, maybe, if he could use the same charm as Lusmore the hump may be taken off him', " And now I have told you the reason of my coming so far; 'tis to find out about this charm if I can", '" Lusmore, who was ever a good-natured little fellow, told the woman all the particulars, how he had raised the tune for the fairies at Knockgrafton, how his hump had been removed from his shoulders, and how he had got a new suit of clothes into the bargain  The woman thanked him very much and then went away, quite happy and easy in her own mind', " When she came back to her gossip's house, in the county of Waterford, she told her everything that Lusmore had said, and they put the little hump-backed man, who was a peevish and cunning creature from his birth, upon a car, and took him all the way across the country" ,  ' You see, there was a waiver lived wanst upon a time in Duleek here, hard by the gate, and a very honest, industherous man he was by all accounts  Well, it was one mornin\' that his housekeeper called to him, and he sitting very busy throwin\' the shuttle; and says she, "Your brekquest is ready!" "Lave me alone," says he; "I\'m busy with a patthern here that is brakin\' my heart, and until I complate and masther it intirely I won\'t quit " "Oh, think o\' the iligant stirabout that\'ll be spylte intirely " "To the divil with the stirabout!" says he  "God forgive you," says she, "for cursin\' your good brekquest " Well, he left the loom at last and wint over to the stirabout, and what would you think, but whin he looked at it, it was as black as a crow; for, you see, it was in the hoighth o\' summer, and the flies lit upon it to that degree that the stirabout was fairly covered with them  "Why, thin, bad luck to your impidence," says the waiver; "would no place sarve you but that? And is it spyling my brekquest yiz are, you dirty bastes?" And with that, bein\' altogether cruked tempered at the time, he lifted his hand, and he made one great slam at the dish o\' stirabout and killed no less than three score and tin flies at the one blow  It was three score and tin exactly, for he counted the carcasses one by one, and laid them out on a clane plate for to view them  Well, he felt a powerful sperit risin\' in him when he seen the slaughter he done at one blow, and with that he got as consaited as the very dickens, and not a sthroke more work he\'d do that day, but out he wint, and was fractious and impident to everyone he met, and was squarein\' up into their faces and sayin\', "Look at that fist! That\'s the fist that killed three score and tin at one blow  Whoo! It is throwin\' away my time I have been all my life," says he, "stuck to my loom, nothin\' but a poor waiver, when it is Saint George or the Dhraggin I ought to be, which is two of the sivin champions o\' Christendom', " I'm detarmined on it, and I'll set off immediately and be a knight arriant", '" Well, sure enough, he wint about among his neighbours the next day, and he got an owld kittle from one and a saucepan from another, and he took them to the tailor, and he sewed him up a shuit o\' tin clothes like any knight arriant, and he borrowed a pot lid, and _that_ he was very partic\'lar about, bekase it was his shield, and he wint to a friend o\' his, a painther and glaizier, and made him paint an his shield in big letthers:  "I\'M THE MAN OF ALL MIN,  THAT KILL\'D THREE SCORE AND TIN  AT A BLOW " "When the people sees that," says the waiver to himself, "the sorra one will dar for to come near me " And with that he towld the housekeeper to scour out the small iron pot for him, "for," says he, "it will make an iligant helmet " And when it was done he put it an his head, and says she, "Is it puttin\' a great heavy iron pot an your head you are by way iv a hat?" "Sartinly," says he, "for a knight arriant should always have a woight an his brain " "But," says she, "there\'s a hole in it, and it can\'t keep out the weather " "It will be the cooler," says he, puttin\' it an him; "besides, if I don\'t like it, it is aisy to stop it with a wisp o\' sthraw, or the like o\' that " "The three legs of it looks mighty quare stickin\' up," says she  "Every helmet has a spike stickin\' out o\' the top of it," says the waiver, "and if mine has three, it\'s only the grandher it is " "Well," says the housekeeper, getting bitther at last, "all I can say is, it isn\'t the first sheep\'s head was dhress\'d in it " "Your sarvint, ma\'am," says he; and off he set', " Well, he was in want of a horse, and so he wint to a field hard by where the miller's horse was grazin' that used to carry the ground corn round the counthry", ' "This is the idintical horse for me," says the waiver  "He is used to carryin\' flour and male; and what am I but the flower o\' shovelry in a coat o\' mail; so that the horse won\'t be put out iv his way in the laste " But as he was ridin\' him out o\' the field, who should see him but the miller  "Is it stalin\' my horse you are, honest man?" says the miller  "No," says the waiver; "I\'m only goin\' to axercise him," says he, "in the cool o\' the evenin\'; it will be good for his health " "Thank you kindly," says the miller, "but lave him where he is, and you\'ll obleege me " "I can\'t afford it," says the waiver, runnin\' the horse at the ditch  "Bad luck to your impidence," says the miller; "you\'ve as much tin about you as a thravellin\' tinker, but you\'ve more brass  Far away on the other side of the world there lived, long ago, a lion and his younger brother, the wild cat, who were so fond of each other that they shared the same hut  The lion was much the bigger and stronger of the two--indeed, he was much bigger and stronger than any of the beasts that dwelt in the forest; and, besides, he could jump father and run faster than all the rest  If strength and swiftness could gain him a dinner he was sure never to be without one, but when it came to cunning, both the grizzly bear and the serpent could get the better of him, and he was forced to call in the help of the wild cat  Now the young wild cat had a lovely golden ball, so beautiful that you could hardly look at it except through a piece of smoked glass, and he kept it hidden in the thick fur muff that went round his neck  A very large old animal, since dead, had given it to him when he was hardly more than a baby, and had told him never to part with it, for as long as he kept it no harm could ever come near him  In general the wild cat did not need to use his ball, for the lion was fond of hunting, and could kill all the food that they needed; but now and then his life would have been in danger had it not been for the golden ball  One day the two brothers started to hunt at daybreak, but as the cat could not run nearly as fast as the lion, he had quite a long start  At least he THOUGHT it was a long one, but in a very few bounds and springs the lion reached his side', " 'There is a bear sitting on that tree,' he whispered softly", " 'He is only waiting for us to pass, to drop down on my back", "' 'Ah, you are so big that he does not see I am behind you,' answered the wild cat", " And, touching the ball, he just said: 'Bear, die!' And the bear tumbled dead out of the tree, and rolled over just in front of them", " For some time they trotted on without any adventures, till just as they were about to cross a strip of long grass on the edge of the forest, the lion's quick ears detected a faint rustling noise", " 'That is a snake,' he cried, stopping short, for he was much more afraid of snakes than of bears", " 'Oh, it is all right,' answered the cat", " 'Snake, die!' And the snake died, and the two brothers skinned it", " They then folded the skin up into a very small parcel, and the cat tucked it into his mane, for snakes' skins can do all sorts of wonderful things, if you are lucky enough to have one of them", " All this time they had had no dinner, for the snake's flesh was not nice, and the lion did not like eating bear--perhaps because he never felt sure that the bear was REALLY dead, and would not jump up alive when his enemy went near him", " Most people are afraid of SOME thing, and bears and serpents were the only creatures that caused the lion's heart to tremble", ' So the two brothers set off again and soon reached the side of a hill where some fine deer were grazing', " 'Kill one of those deer for your own dinner,' said the boy-brother, 'but catch me another alive", ' I want him', "' The lion at once sprang towards them with a loud roar, but the deer bounded away, and they were all three soon lost to sight", ' The cat waited for a long while, but finding that the lion did not return, went back to the house where they lived  It was quite dark when the lion came home, where his brother was sitting curled up in one corner', " 'Did you catch the deer for me?' asked the boy-brother, springing up", " 'Well, no,' replied the man-brother", " 'The fact is, that I did not get up to them till we had run half way across the world and left the wind far behind us", ' Think what a trouble it would have been to drag it here! So--I just ate them both', "' The cat said nothing, but he did not feel that he loved his big brother" ,  ' The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a white crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares  Now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat  The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible  The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, "What ails thee, friend?" He told him why  "I could free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me " "Don\'t be afraid, friend, I\'ll not eat thee; only save my life " "Very well," says he, and caused him to lie down on his left side  But thinking to himself, "Who knows what this fellow will do," he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak  Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out', " As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled on a branch", ' The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed  The crane thinking "I will sound him," settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:   "A service have we done thee    To the best of our ability,   King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!    What return shall we get from thee?" In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:   "As I feed on blood,    And always hunt for prey,   \'Tis much that thou art still alive    Having once been between my teeth " Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:   "Ungrateful, doing no good,    Not doing as he would be done by,   In him there is no gratitude,    To serve him is useless    "His friendship is not won    By the clearest good deed    Better softly withdraw from him,    Neither envying nor abusing " And having thus spoken the crane flew away  _And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to add: "Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white crane was I myself "_     There was once a little brother who took his Sister by the hand, and said, "Since our own dear mother\'s death we have not had one happy hour; our stepmother beats us every day, and, when we come near her, kicks us away with her foot  Come, let us wander forth into the wide world " So all day long they travelled over meadows, fields, and stony roads  By the evening they came into a large forest, and laid themselves down in a hollow tree, and went to sleep  When they awoke the next morning, the sun had already risen high in the heavens, and its beams made the tree so hot that the little boy said to his sister, "I am so very thirsty, that if I knew where there was a brook, I would go and drink  Ah! I think I hear one running;" and so saying, he got up, and taking his Sister\'s hand they went to look for the brook  The wicked stepmother, however, was a witch, and had witnessed the departure of the two children: so, sneaking after them secretly, as is the habit of witches, she had enchanted all the springs in the forest  Presently they found a brook, which ran trippingly over the pebbles, and the Brother would have drunk out of it, but the Sister heard how it said as it ran along, "Who drinks of me will become a tiger!" So the Sister exclaimed, "I pray you, Brother, drink not, or you will become a tiger, and tear me to pieces!" So the Brother did not drink, although his thirst was very great, and he said, "I will wait till the next brook " As they came to the second, the Sister heard it say, "Who drinks of me becomes a wolf!" The Sister ran up crying, "Brother, do not, pray do not drink, or you will become a wolf and eat me up!" Then the Brother did not drink, saying, "I will wait until we come to the next spring, but then I must drink, you may say what you will; my thirst is much too great " Just as they reached the third brook, the Sister heard the voice saying, "Who drinks of me will become a fawn--who drinks of me will become a fawn!" So the Sister said, "Oh, my Brother do not drink, or you will be changed into a fawn, and run away from me!" But he had already kneeled down, and he drank of the water, and, as the first drops passed his lips, his shape took that of a fawn  At first the Sister wept over her little, changed Brother, and he wept too, and knelt by her, very sorrowful; but at last the maiden said, "Be still, dear little fawn, and I will never forsake you!" and, taking off her golden garter, she placed it around his neck, and, weaving rushes, made a girdle to lead him with  This she tied to him, and taking the other end in her hand, she led him away, and they travelled deeper and deeper into the forest  After they had gone a long distance they came to a little hut, and the maiden, peeping in, found it empty, and thought, "Here we can stay and dwell " Then she looked for leaves and moss to make a soft couch for the Fawn, and every morning she went out and collected roots and berries and nuts for herself, and tender grass for the Fawn  In the evening when the Sister was tired, and had said her prayers, she laid her head upon the back of the Fawn, which served for a pillow, on which she slept soundly  Had but the Brother regained his own proper form, their lives would have been happy indeed  Thus they dwelt in this wilderness, and some time had elapsed when it happened that the King of the country had a great hunt in the forest; and now sounded through the trees the blowing of horns, the barking of dogs, and the lusty cry of the hunters, so that the little Fawn heard them, and wanted very much to join in  "Ah!" said he to his Sister, "let me go to the hunt, I cannot restrain myself any longer;" and he begged so hard that at last she consented  "But," she told him, "return again in the evening, for I shall shut my door against the wild huntsmen, and, that I may know you, do you knock, and say, \'Sister, dear, let me in,\' and if you do not speak I shall not open the door " As soon as she had said this, the little Fawn sprang off quite glad and merry in the fresh breeze  The King and his huntsmen perceived the beautiful animal, and pursued him; but they could not catch him, and when they thought they certainly had him, he sprang away over the bushes, and got out of sight  Just as it was getting dark, he ran up to the hut, and, knocking, said, "Sister mine, let me in " Then she unfastened the little door, and he went in, and rested all night long upon his soft couch  The next morning the hunt was commenced again, and as soon as the little Fawn heard the horns and the tally-ho of the sportsmen he could not rest, and said, "Sister, dear, open the door; I must be off " The Sister opened it, saying, "Return at evening, mind, and say the words as before " When the King and his huntsmen saw him again, the Fawn with the golden necklace, they followed him, close, but he was too nimble and quick for them  The whole day long they kept up with him, but towards evening the huntsmen made a circle around him, and one wounded him slightly in the hinder foot, so that he could run but slowly  Then one of them slipped after him to the little hut, and heard him say, "Sister, dear, open the door," and saw that the door was opened and immediately shut behind him  The huntsman, having observed all this, went and told the King what he had seen and heard, and he said, "On the morrow I will pursue him once again " The Sister, however, was terribly afraid when she saw that her Fawn was wounded, and, washing off the blood, she put herbs upon the foot, and said, "Go and rest upon your bed, dear Fawn, that your wound may heal  There were once an old man, as old as I am, perhaps, and an old woman, his wife, and they lived together in a hut, in a village on the edge of the forest  There were many people in the village; quite a town it was--eight huts at least, thirty or forty souls, good company to be had for crossing the road  But the old man and the old woman were unhappy, in spite of living like that in the very middle of the world  And why do you think they were unhappy? They were unhappy because they had no little Vanya and no little Maroosia  Think of that  Some would say they were better off without them  "Would you say that, grandfather?" asked Maroosia  "You are a stupid little pigeon," said old Peter, and he went on  Well, these two were very unhappy  All the other huts had babies in them--yes, and little ones playing about in the road outside, and having to be shouted at when any one came driving by  But there were no babies in their hut, and the old woman never had to go to the door to see where her little one had strayed to, because she had no little one  And these two, the old man and the old woman, used to stand whole hours, just peeping through their window to watch the children playing outside  They had dogs and a cat, and cocks and hens, but none of these made up for having no children  These two would just stand and watch the children of the other huts  The dogs would bark, but they took no notice; and the cat would curl up against them, but they never felt her; and as for the cocks and hens, well, they were fed, but that was all  The old people did not care for them, and spent all their time in watching the Vanyas and Maroosias who belonged to the other huts  In the winter the children in their little sheepskin coats     "Like ours?" said Vanya and Maroosia together  "Like yours," said old Peter  In their little sheepskin coats, he went on, played in the crisp snow  They pelted each other with snowballs, and shouted and laughed, and then they rolled the snow together and made a snow woman--a regular snow Baba Yaga, a snow witch; such an old fright! And the old man, watching from the window, saw this, and he says to the old woman,-- "Wife, let us go into the yard behind and make a little snow girl; and perhaps she will come alive, and be a little daughter to us " "Husband," says the old woman, "there\'s no knowing what may be  Let us go into the yard and make a little snow girl " So the two old people put on their big coats and their fur hats, and went out into the yard, where nobody could see them  And they rolled up the snow, and began to make a little snow girl  Very, very tenderly they rolled up the snow to make her little arms and legs  The good God helped the old people, and their little snow girl was more beautiful than ever you could imagine  There was once a little boy who had caught cold; he had gone out and got wet feet  Nobody had the least idea how it had happened; the weather was quite dry  His mother undressed him, put him to bed, and ordered the teapot to be brought in, that she might make him a good cup of tea from the elder-tree blossoms, which is so warming  At the same time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by himself in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely life, for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of others very much, and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories, that it was a pleasure to hear him  "Now, drink your tea," said the mother; "perhaps you will hear a story " "Yes, if I only knew a fresh one," said the old man, and nodded smilingly  "But how did the little fellow get his wet feet?" he then asked  "That," replied the mother, "nobody can understand " "Will you tell me a story?" asked the boy  "Yes, if you can tell me as nearly as possible how deep is the gutter in the little street where you go to school " "Just half as high as my top-boots," replied the boy; "but then I must stand in the deepest holes " "There, now we know where you got your wet feet," said the old man  "I ought to tell you a story, but the worst of it is, I do not know any more " "You can make one up," said the little boy  "Mother says you can tell a fairy tale about anything you look at or touch " "That is all very well, but such tales or stories are worth nothing! No, the right ones come by themselves and knock at my forehead saying: \'Here I am \'" "Will not one knock soon?" asked the boy; and the mother smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling water over them  "Pray, tell me a story " "Yes, if stories came by themselves; they are so proud, they only come when they please --But wait," he said suddenly, "there is one  Look at the teapot; there is a story in it now " And the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose up gradually, the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one, fresh and white; long boughs came forth; even out of the spout they grew up in all directions, and formed a bush--nay, a large elder tree, which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains aside; and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance! In the midst of the tree sat a kindly-looking old woman with a strange dress; it was as green as the leaves, and trimmed with large white blossoms, so that it was difficult to say whether it was real cloth, or the leaves and blossoms of the elder-tree  "What is this woman\'s name?" asked the little boy  "Well, the Romans and Greeks used to call her a Dryad," said the old man; "but we do not understand that', " Out in the sailors' quarter they give her a better name; there she is called elder-tree mother", ' Now, you must attentively listen to her and look at the beautiful elder-tree  "Just such a large tree, covered with flowers, stands out there; it grew in the corner of an humble little yard; under this tree sat two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine  He was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here', " 'I know very well when the golden wedding is to take place,' she said; but they did not hear it--they were talking of bygone days", ' "\'Well, do you remember?\' said the old sailor, \'when we were quite small and used to run about and play--it was in the very same yard where we now are--we used to put little branches into the ground and make a garden  In a part of the world whose name I forget lived once upon a time two kings, called Peridor and Diamantino  They were cousins as well as neighbours, and both were under the protection of the fairies; though it is only fair to say that the fairies did not love them half so well as their wives did  Now it often happens that as princes can generally manage to get their own way it is harder for them to be good than it is for common people  So it was with Peridor and Diamantino; but of the two, the fairies declared that Diamantino was much the worst; indeed, he behaved so badly to his wife Aglantino, that the fairies would not allow him to live any longer; and he died, leaving behind him a little daughter  As she was an only child, of course this little girl was the heiress of the kingdom, but, being still only a baby, her mother, the widow of Diamantino, was proclaimed regent  The Queen-dowager was wise and good, and tried her best to make her people happy  The only thing she had to vex her was the absence of her daughter; for the fairies, for reasons of their own, determined to bring up the little Princess Serpentine among themselves  As to the other King, he was really fond of his wife, Queen Constance, but he often grieved her by his thoughtless ways, and in order to punish him for his carelessness, the fairies caused her to die quite suddenly  When she was gone the King felt how much he had loved her, and his grief was so great (though he never neglected his duties) that his subjects called him Peridor the Sorrowful  It seems hardly possible that any man should live like Peridor for fifteen years plunged in such depth of grief, and most likely he would have died too if it had not been for the fairies', " The one comfort the poor King had was his son, Prince Saphir, who was only three years old at the time of his mother's death, and great care was given to his education", ' By the time he was fifteen Saphir had learnt everything that a prince should know, and he was, besides, charming and agreeable  It was about this time that the fairies suddenly took fright lest his love for his father should interfere with the plans they had made for the young prince  So, to prevent this, they placed in a pretty little room of which Saphir was very fond a little mirror in a black frame, such as were often brought from Venice  The Prince did not notice for some days that there was anything new in the room, but at last he perceived it, and went up to look at it more closely  What was his surprise to see reflected in the mirror, not his own face, but that of a young girl as lovely as the morning! And, better still, every movement of the girl, just growing out of childhood, was also reflected in the wonderful glass  As might have been expected, the young Prince lost his heart completely to the beautiful image, and it was impossible to get him out of the room, so busy was he in watching the lovely unknown  Certainly it was very delightful to be able to see her whom he loved at any moment he chose, but his spirits sometimes sank when he wondered what was to be the end of this adventure', " The magic mirror had been for about a year in the Prince's possession, when one day a new subject of disquiet seized upon him", ' As usual, he was engaged in looking at the girl, when suddenly he thought he saw a second mirror reflected in the first, exactly like his own, and with the same power  And in this he was perfectly right  The young girl had only possessed it for a short time, and neglected all her duties for the sake of the mirror', " Now it was not difficult for Saphir to guess the reason of the change in her, nor why the new mirror was consulted so often; but try as he would he could never see the face of the person who was reflected in it, for the young girl's figure always came between", ' All he knew was that the face was that of a man, and this was quite enough to make him madly jealous  This was the doing of the fairies, and we must suppose that they had their reasons for acting as they did  When these things happened Saphir was about eighteen years old, and fifteen years had passed away since the death of his mother  King Peridor had grown more and more unhappy as time went on, and at last he fell so ill that it seemed as if his days were numbered  He was so much beloved by his subjects that this sad news was heard with despair by the nation, and more than all by the Prince  During his whole illness the King never spoke of anything but the Queen, his sorrow at having grieved her, and his hope of one day seeing her again  All the doctors and all the water-cures in the kingdom had been tried, and nothing would do him any good  A long, long way off, in a land where water is very scarce, there lived a man and his wife and several children', " One day the wife said to her husband, 'I am pining to have the liver of a nyamatsane for my dinner", ' If you love me as much as you say you do, you will go out and hunt for a nyamatsane, and will kill it and get its liver  If not, I shall know that your love is not worth having', "' 'Bake some bread,' was all her husband answered, 'then take the crust and put it in this little bag", "' The wife did as she was told, and when she had finished she said to her husband, 'The bag is all ready and quite full", "' 'Very well,' said he, 'and now good-bye; I am going after the nyamatsane", "' But the nyamatsane was not so easy to find as the woman had hoped", ' The husband walked on and on and on without ever seeing one, and every now and then he felt so hungry that he was obliged to eat one of the crusts of bread out of his bag  At last, when he was ready to drop from fatigue, he found himself on the edge of a great marsh, which bordered on one side the country of the nyamatsanes  But there were no more nyamatsanes here than anywhere else  They had all gone on a hunting expedition, as their larder was empty, and the only person left at home was their grandmother, who was so feeble she never went out of the house  Our friend looked on this as a great piece of luck, and made haste to kill her before the others returned, and to take out her liver, after which he dressed himself in her skin as well as he could  He had scarcely done this when he heard the noise of the nyamatsanes coming back to their grandmother, for they were very fond of her, and never stayed away from her longer than they could help', " They rushed clattering into the hut, exclaiming, 'We smell human flesh! Some man is here,' and began to look about for him; but they only saw their old grandmother, who answered, in a trembling voice, 'No, my children, no! What should any man be doing here?' The nyamatsanes paid no attention to her, and began to open all the cupboards, and peep under all the beds, crying out all the while, 'A man is here! a man is here!' but they could find nobody, and at length, tired out with their long day's hunting, they curled themselves up and fell asleep", " Next morning they woke up quite refreshed, and made ready to start on another expedition; but as they did not feel happy about their grandmother they said to her, 'Grandmother, won't you come to-day and feed with us?' And they led their grandmother outside, and all of them began hungrily to eat pebbles", ' Our friend pretended to do the same, but in reality he slipped the stones into his pouch, and swallowed the crusts of bread instead  However, as the nyamatsanes did not see this they had no idea that he was not really their grandmother  When they had eaten a great many pebbles they thought they had done enough for that day, and all went home together and curled themselves up to sleep', " Next morning when they woke they said, 'Let us go and amuse ourselves by jumping over the ditch,' and every time they cleared it with a bound", ' Then they begged their grandmother to jump over it too, end with a tremendous effort she managed to spring right over to the other side  After this they had no doubt at all of its being their true grandmother, and went off to their hunting, leaving our friend at home in the hut  As soon as they had gone out of sight our hero made haste to take the liver from the place where he had hid it, threw off the skin of the old nyamatsane, and ran away as hard as he could, only stopping to pick up a very brilliant and polished little stone, which he put in his bag by the side of the liver  Towards evening the nyamatsanes came back to the hut full of anxiety to know how their grandmother had got on during their absence', " The first thing they saw on entering the door was her skin lying on the floor, and then they knew that they had been deceived, and they said to each other, 'So we were right, after all, and it was human flesh we smelt", "' Then they stooped down to find traces of the man's footsteps, and when they had got them instantly set out in hot pursuit", ' Meanwhile our friend had journeyed many miles, and was beginning to feel quite safe and comfortable, when, happening to look round, he saw in the distance a thick cloud of dust moving rapidly', " His heart stood still within him, and he said to himself, 'I am lost", " It is the nyamatsanes, and they will tear me in pieces,' and indeed the cloud of dust was drawing near with amazing quickness, and the nyamatsanes almost felt as if they were already devouring him", ' Then as a last hope the man took the little stone that he had picked up out of his bag and flung it on the ground  It was terribly cold and nearly dark on the last evening of the old year, and the snow was falling fast  In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, roamed through the streets  It is true she had on a pair of slippers when she left home, but they were not of much use  They were very large, so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the poor little creature had lost them in running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate  One of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other and ran away with it, saying that he could use it as a cradle, when he had children of his own  So the little girl went on with her little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold  In an old apron she carried a number of matches, and had a bundle of them in her hands  No one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given here even a penny  Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery  The snowflakes fell on her long, fair hair, which hung in curls on her shoulders, but she regarded them not', " Lights were shining from every window, and there was a savory smell of roast goose, for it was New-year's eve--yes, she remembered that", ' In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself together  She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money  Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here, for they had only the roof to cover them, through which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags  Her little hands were almost frozen with the cold  Ah! perhaps a burning match might be some good, if she could draw it from the bundle and strike it against the wall, just to warm her fingers  She drew one out-"scratch!" how it sputtered as it burnt! It gave a warm, bright light, like a little candle, as she held her hand over it  It was really a wonderful light  It seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron stove, with polished brass feet and a brass ornament  How the fire burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the half-burnt match in her hand  She rubbed another match on the wall  It burst into a flame, and where its light fell upon the wall it became as transparent as a veil, and she could see into the room  The table was covered with a snowy white table-cloth, on which stood a splendid dinner service, and a steaming roast goose, stuffed with apples and dried plums  And what was still more wonderful, the goose jumped down from the dish and waddled across the floor, with a knife and fork in its breast, to the little girl  Then the match went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, damp, cold wall before her  She lighted another match, and then she found herself sitting under a beautiful Christmas-tree', " It was larger and more beautifully decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door at the rich merchant's", ' Thousands of tapers were burning upon the green branches, and colored pictures, like those she had seen in the show-windows, looked down upon it all  The little one stretched out her hand towards them, and the match went out  The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they looked to her like the stars in the sky  Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and evening--the last evening of the year  In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet  When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast  One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself  So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold  She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand  Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing  She crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little thing! The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought', " From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought", ' In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she seated herself down and cowered together  Her little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags  Her little hands were almost numbed with cold  Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it  She drew one out  "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light  It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top  The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully  The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand  She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room  On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums  And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind  She lighted another match', " Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's house", ' Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her  The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when--the match went out  The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire  "Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God  She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an expression of love  "Grandmother!" cried the little one  "Oh, take me with you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her  Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above  There dwell the Sea King and his subjects  We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand  No, indeed; the most singular flowers and plants grow there; the leaves and stems of which are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life  Fishes, both large and small, glide between the branches, as birds fly among the trees here upon land  In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of the Sea King  Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic windows are of the clearest amber  The roof is formed of shells, that open and close as the water flows over them  Their appearance is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would be fit for the diadem of a queen  The Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his aged mother kept house for him  She was a very wise woman, and exceedingly proud of her high birth; on that account she wore twelve oysters on her tail; while others, also of high rank, were only allowed to wear six  She was, however, deserving of very great praise, especially for her care of the little sea-princesses, her grand-daughters', " They were six beautiful children; but the youngest was the prettiest of them all; her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like all the others, she had no feet, and her body ended in a fish's tail", ' All day long they played in the great halls of the castle, or among the living flowers that grew out of the walls  The large amber windows were open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows, excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed themselves to be stroked  Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden, in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers, and blossoms like flames of fire; the fruit glittered like gold, and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually  The earth itself was the finest sand, but blue as the flame of burning sulphur  Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance, as if it were surrounded by the air from above, through which the blue sky shone, instead of the dark depths of the sea  In calm weather the sun could be seen, looking like a purple flower, with the light streaming from the calyx  Each of the young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden, where she might dig and plant as she pleased  One arranged her flower-bed into the form of a whale; another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid; but that of the youngest was round like the sun, and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset  She was a strange child, quiet and thoughtful; and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels, she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers, like the sun, excepting a beautiful marble statue  It was the representation of a handsome boy, carved out of pure white stone, which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck  She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow  It grew splendidly, and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue, almost down to the blue sands  The shadow had a violet tint, and waved to and fro like the branches; it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play, and trying to kiss each other  Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea  She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns, the people and the animals  To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance, and not those below the sea; that the trees of the forest should be green; and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly, that it was quite a pleasure to hear them  Her grandmother called the little birds fishes, or she would not have understood her; for she had never seen birds  The next day the great cloud still hung over the mountain, and the rain poured like water from a full sponge  The princess was very fond of being out of doors, and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather was no better', " But the mist was not of such a dark dingy grey; there was light in it; and as the hours went on it grew brighter and brighter, until it was almost too brilliant to look at; and late in the afternoon the sun broke out so gloriously that Irene clapped her hands, crying: 'See, see, Lootie! The sun has had his face washed", ' Look how bright he is! Do get my hat, and let us go out for a walk', " Oh, dear! oh, dear! how happy I am!' Lootie was very glad to please the princess", ' She got her hat and cloak, and they set out together for a walk up the mountain; for the road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it, and it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain ceased  The clouds were rolling away in broken pieces, like great, overwoolly sheep, whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost too white for the eyes to bear  Between them the sky shone with a deeper and purer blue, because of the rain  The trees on the roadside were hung all over with drops, which sparkled in the sun like jewels  The only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that ran down the mountain; they had changed from the clearness of crystal to a muddy brown; but what they lost in colour they gained in sound--or at least in noise, for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as before  But Irene was in raptures with the great brown streams tumbling down everywhere; and Lootie shared in her delight, for she too had been confined to the house for three days  At length she observed that the sun was getting low, and said it was time to be going back  She made the remark again and again, but, every time, the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a little farther; reminding her that it was much easier to go downhill, and saying that when they did turn they would be at home in a moment  So on and on they did go, now to look at a group of ferns over whose tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch, now to pick a shining stone from a rock by the wayside, now to watch the flight of some bird  Suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind, and shot in front of them', " When the nurse saw it, she started and shook, and catching hold of the princess's hand turned and began to run down the hill", " 'What's all the haste, nursie?' asked Irene, running alongside of her", " 'We must not be out a moment longer", "' 'But we can't help being out a good many moments longer", "' It was too true", ' The nurse almost cried  They were much too far from home', " It was against express orders to be out with the princess one moment after the sun was down; and they were nearly a mile up the mountain! If His Majesty, Irene's papa, were to hear of it, Lootie would certainly be dismissed; and to leave the princess would break her heart", ' It was no wonder she ran  But Irene was not in the least frightened, not knowing anything to be frightened at  She kept on chattering as well as she could, but it was not easy', " 'Lootie! Lootie! why do you run so fast? It shakes my teeth when I talk", "' 'Then don't talk,' said Lootie", " 'But the princess went on talking", " She was always saying: 'Look, look, Lootie!' but Lootie paid no more heed to anything she said, only ran on" ,  ' There lived once a great queen, in whose garden were found at all seasons the most splendid flowers, and from every land in the world  She specially loved roses, and therefore she possessed the most beautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild hedge-rose, with its apple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence rose  They grew near the shelter of the walls, wound themselves round columns and window-frames, crept along passages and over the ceilings of the halls  They were of every fragrance and color  But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon a sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die  "There is still one thing that could save her," said one of the wisest among them  "Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her before her eyes close, she will not die " Then from all parts came those who brought roses that bloomed in every garden, but they were not the right sort  The flower must be one from the garden of love; but which of the roses there showed forth the highest and purest love? The poets sang of this rose, the loveliest in the world, and each named one which he considered worthy of that title; and intelligence of what was required was sent far and wide to every heart that beat with love; to every class, age, and condition  "No one has yet named the flower," said the wise man  "No one has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor  It is not a rose from the coffin of Romeo and Juliet, or from the grave of Walburg, though these roses will live in everlasting song  It is not one of the roses which sprouted forth from the blood-stained fame of Winkelreid  The blood which flows from the breast of a hero who dies for his country is sacred, and his memory is sweet, and no rose can be redder than the blood which flows from his veins  Neither is it the magic flower of Science, to obtain which wondrous flower a man devotes many an hour of his fresh young life in sleepless nights, in a lonely chamber " "I know where it blooms," said a happy mother, who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen  "I know where the loveliest rose in the world is  It is seen on the blooming cheeks of my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles upon me with childlike affection " "This is a lovely rose," said the wise man; "but there is one still more lovely " "Yes, one far more lovely," said one of the women  "I have seen it, and a loftier and purer rose does not bloom  But it was white, like the leaves of a blush-rose  I saw it on the cheeks of the queen  She had taken off her golden crown, and through the long, dreary night, she carried her sick child in her arms  She wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish " "Holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of grief, but it is not the one we seek " "No; the loveliest rose in the world I saw at the Lord\'s table," said the good old bishop  "I saw it shine as if an angel\'s face had appeared  A young maiden knelt at the altar, and renewed the vows made at her baptism; and there were white roses and red roses on the blushing cheeks of that young girl  She looked up to heaven with all the purity and love of her young spirit, in all the expression of the highest and purest love  Once upon a time there was a king and queen who lived happily and comfortably together  They were very fond of each other and had nothing to worry them, but at last the king grew restless  He longed to go out into the world, to try his strength in battle against some enemy and to win all kinds of honour and glory  So he called his army together and gave orders to start for a distant country where a heathen king ruled who ill-treated or tormented everyone he could lay his hands on  The king then gave his parting orders and wise advice to his ministers, took a tender leave of his wife, and set off with his army across the seas  I cannot say whether the voyage was short or long; but at last he reached the country of the heathen king and marched on, defeating all who came in his way  But this did not last long, for in time he came to a mountain pass, where a large army was waiting for him, who put his soldiers to flight, and took the king himself prisoner  He was carried off to the prison where the heathen king kept his captives, and now our poor friend had a very bad time indeed  All night long the prisoners were chained up, and in the morning they were yoked together like oxen and had to plough the land till it grew dark', " This state of things went on for three years before the king found any means of sending news of himself to his dear queen, but at last he contrived to send this letter: 'Sell all our castles and palaces, and put all our treasures in pawn and come and deliver me out of this horrible prison", "' The queen received the letter, read it, and wept bitterly as she said to herself, 'How can I deliver my dearest husband? If I go myself and the heathen king sees me he will just take me to be one of his wives", ' If I were to send one of the ministers!--but I hardly know if I can depend on them', "' She thought, and thought, and at last an idea came into her head", " She cut off all her beautiful long brown hair and dressed herself in boy's clothes", ' Then she took her lute and, without saying anything to anyone, she went forth into the wide world  She travelled through many lands and saw many cities, and went through many hardships before she got to the town where the heathen king lived  When she got there she walked all round the palace and at the back she saw the prison  Then she went into the great court in front of the palace, and taking her lute in her hand, she began to play so beautifully that one felt as though one could never hear enough', " After she had played for some time she began to sing, and her voice was sweeter than the lark's:   'I come from my own country far      Into this foreign land,    Of all I own I take alone      My sweet lute in my hand", "   'Oh! who will thank me for my song,      Reward my simple lay?    Like lover's sighs it still shall rise      To greet thee day by day", "   'I sing of blooming flowers      Made sweet by sun and rain;    Of all the bliss of love's first kiss,      And parting's cruel pain", "   'Of the sad captive's longing      Within his prison wall,    Of hearts that sigh when none are nigh      To answer to their call", "   'My song begs for your pity,      And gifts from out your store,    And as I play my gentle lay      I linger near your door", "   'And if you hear my singing      Within your palace, sire,   Oh! give, I pray, this happy day,      To me my heart's desire", "' No sooner had the heathen king heard this touching song sung by such a lovely voice, than he had the singer brought before him", " 'Welcome, O lute player,' said he", " 'Where do you come from?' 'My country, sire, is far away across many seas", ' For years I have been wandering about the world and gaining my living by my music', "' 'Stay here then a few days, and when you wish to leave I will give you what you ask for in your song--your heart's desire", "' So the lute player stayed on in the palace and sang and played almost all day long to the king, who could never tire of listening and almost forgot to eat or drink or to torment people" ,  ' "Moll Roe Rafferty, the daughter of ould Jack Rafferty, was a fine young bouncin\' girl, large an\' lavish, wid a purty head of hair on her like scarlet, that bein\' one of the raisons why she was called _Roe_ or red; her arms and cheeks were much the colour of the hair, an\' her saddle nose was the purtiest thing of its kind that ever was on a face  "Well, anyhow, it was Moll Rafferty that was the _dilsy_  It happened that there was a nate vagabone in the neighbourhood, just as much overburdened wid beauty as herself, and he was named Gusty Gillespie', " Gusty was what they call a black-mouth Prosbytarian, and wouldn't keep Christmas day, except what they call 'ould style", "' Gusty was rather good-lookin', when seen in the dark, as well as Moll herself; anyhow, they got attached to each other, and in the end everything was arranged for their marriage", ' "Now this was the first marriage that had happened for a long time in the neighbourhood between a Prodestant and a Catholic, and faix, there was one of the bride\'s uncles, ould Harry Connolly, a fairyman, who could cure all complaints wid a secret he had, and as he didn\'t wish to see his niece married on sich a fellow, he fought bittherly against the match', " All Moll's friends, however, stood up for the marriage, barrin' him, and, of coorse, the Sunday was appointed, as I said, that they were to be dove-tailed together", ' "Well, the day arrived, and Moll, as became her, went to mass, and Gusty to meeting, afther which they were to join one another in Jack Rafferty\'s, where the priest, Father Mc  Sorley, was to slip up afther mass to take his dinner wid them, and to keep Misther Mc  Shuttle, who was to marry them, company', " Nobody remained at home but ould Jack Rafferty an' his wife, who stopped to dress the dinner, for, to tell the truth, it was to be a great let-out entirely", ' Maybe, if all was known, too, Father Mc', " Sorley was to give them a cast of his office over and above the ministher, in regard that Moll's friends were not altogether satisfied at the kind of marriage which Mc", ' Shuttle could give them  The sorrow may care about that--splice here, splice there--all I can say is that when Mrs  Rafferty was goin\' to tie up a big bag pudden, in walks Harry Connolly, the fairyman, in a rage, and shouts out, \'Blood and blunderbushes, what are yez here for?\' "\'Arrah, why, Harry?

"Are you willing to pay for such accomplishments?" asked the wise chemist  "Certainly," answered Claribel, jingling her purse  "Then come to me to-morrow at two o\'clock," said he', " All that night he practiced what is known as chemical sorcery; so that when Claribel Sudds came next day at two o'clock he showed her a small box filled with compounds that closely resembled French bonbons", ' "This is a progressive age," said the old man, "and I flatter myself your Uncle Daws keeps right along with the procession  Now, one of your old-fashioned sorcerers would have made you some nasty, bitter pills to swallow; but I have consulted your taste and convenience  Here are some magic bonbons  If you eat this one with the lavender color you can dance thereafter as lightly and gracefully as if you had been trained a lifetime  After you consume the pink confection you will sing like a nightingale  Eating the white one will enable you to become the finest elocutionist in the land  The chocolate piece will charm you into playing the piano better than Rubenstein, while after eating you lemon-yellow bonbon you can easily kick six feet above your head " "How delightful!" exclaimed Claribel, who was truly enraptured  "You are certainly a most clever sorcerer as well as a considerate compounder," and she held out her hand for the box  "Ahem!" said the wise one; "a check, please " "Oh, yes; to be sure! How stupid of me to forget it," she returned  He considerately retained the box in his own hand while she signed a check for a large amount of money, after which he allowed her to hold the box herself  "Are you sure you have made them strong enough?" she inquired, anxiously; "it usually takes a great deal to affect me " "My only fear," replied Dr  Daws, "is that I have made them too strong  For this is the first time I have ever been called upon to prepare these wonderful confections " "Don\'t worry," said Claribel; "the stronger they act the better I shall act myself " She went away, after saying this, but stopping in at a dry goods store to shop, she forgot the precious box in her new interest and left it lying on the ribbon counter  Then little Bessie Bostwick came to the counter to buy a hair ribbon and laid her parcels beside the box  When she went away she gathered up the box with her other bundles and trotted off home with it  Bessie never knew, until after she had hung her coat in the hall closet and counted up her parcels, that she had one too many  There was once an old couple named Peder and Kirsten who had an only son called Hans  From the time he was a little boy he had been told that on his sixteenth birthday he must go out into the world and serve his apprenticeship  So, one fine summer morning, he started off to seek his fortune with nothing but the clothes he wore on his back  For many hours he trudged on merrily, now and then stopping to drink from some clear spring or to pick some ripe fruit from a tree', " The little wild creatures peeped at him from beneath the bushes, and he nodded and smiled, and wished them 'Good-morning", "' After he had been walking for some time he met an old white-bearded man who was coming along the footpath", ' The boy would not step aside, and the man was determined not to do so either, so they ran against one another with a bump', " 'It seems to me,' said the old fellow, 'that a boy should give way to an old man", "' 'The path is for me as well as for you,' answered young Hans saucily, for he had never been taught politeness", " 'Well, that's true enough,' answered the other mildly", " 'And where are you going?' 'I am going into service,' said Hans", " 'Then you can come and serve me,' replied the man", " Well, Hans could do that; but what would his wages be? 'Two pounds a year, and nothing to do but keep some rooms clean,' said the new-comer", " This seemed to Hans to be easy enough; so he agreed to enter the old man's service, and they set out together", ' On their way they crossed a deep valley and came to a mountain, where the man opened a trapdoor, and bidding Hans follow him, he crept in and began to go down a long flight of steps  When they got to the bottom Hans saw a large number of rooms lit by many lamps and full of beautiful things', " While he was looking round the old man said to him: 'Now you know what you have to do", ' You must keep these rooms clean, and strew sand on the floor every day  Here is a table where you will always find food and drink, and there is your bed  You see there are a great many suits of clothes hanging on the wall, and you may wear any you please; but remember that you are never to open this locked door  If you do ill will befall you  Farewell, for I am going away again and cannot tell when I may return  No sooner had the old man disappeared than Hans sat down to a good meal, and after that went to bed and slept until the morning  At first he could not remember what had happened to him, but by-and-by he jumped up and went into all the rooms, which he examined carefully', " 'How foolish to bid me to put sand on the floors,' he thought, 'when there is nobody here by myself! I shall do nothing of the sort", "' And so he shut the doors quickly, and only cleaned and set in order his own room", ' And after the first few days he felt that that was unnecessary too, because no one came there to see if the rooms where clean or not  At last he did no work at all, but just sat and wondered what was behind the locked door, till he determined to go and look for himself  The key turned easily in the lock  Hans entered, half frightened at what he was doing, and the first thing he beheld was a heap of bones  Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister  The brothers were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family  It was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook  The wives for this reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they combined together to oust her from the office of cook and general provider, so that one of themselves might obtain it  They said, "She does not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home, and yet she has not the meals ready at the proper time " They then called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, "At midday when our sister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that on seeing her pitcher the water shall vanish, and again slowly re-appear  In this way she will be delayed  Let the water not flow into her pitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own " At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her, and she began to weep  Then after a while the water began slowly to rise  When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it would not go under the water  Being frightened she began to wail and cry to her brother:   "Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,   Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip " The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began to wail again:   "Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,   Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip " The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried again:   "Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,   Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip " The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:   "Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,   Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip " At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then she cried aloud:   "Oh! my brother, the water measures a man\'s height,   Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill " The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was drowned  The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and carried her off  After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of the tank in which she had been drowned  When the bamboo had grown to an immense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing it, said to himself, "This will make a splendid fiddle " So one day he brought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin, the bamboo called out, "Do not cut at the root, cut higher up " When he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, "Do not cut near the top, cut at the root " When the Jogi again prepared himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, "Do not cut at the root, cut higher up;" and when he was about to cut higher up, it again called out to him, "Do not cut high up, cut at the root " The Jogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him, so becoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away made a fiddle out of it  The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it  The Jogi carried it with him when he went a-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned home every evening with a full wallet', " He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga girl's brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly", ' Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter anguish  The elder brother wished to purchase it, and offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to part with his wonderful instrument  The Jogi, however, knew its value, and refused to sell it  Right in the middle of Japan, high up among the mountains, an old man lived in his little house  He was very proud of it, and never tired of admiring the whiteness of his straw mats, and the pretty papered walls, which in warm weather always slid back, so that the smell of the trees and flowers might come in  One day he was standing looking at the mountain opposite, when he heard a kind of rumbling noise in the room behind him  He turned round, and in the corner he beheld a rusty old iron kettle, which could not have seen the light of day for many years  How the kettle got there the old man did not know, but he took it up and looked it over carefully, and when he found that it was quite whole he cleaned the dust off it and carried it into his kitchen', " 'That was a piece of luck,' he said, smiling to himself; 'a good kettle costs money, and it is as well to have a second one at hand in case of need; mine is getting worn out, and the water is already beginning to come through its bottom", "' Then he took the other kettle off the fire, filled the new one with water, and put it in its place", ' No sooner was the water in the kettle getting warm than a strange thing happened, and the man, who was standing by, thought he must be dreaming  First the handle of the kettle gradually changed its shape and became a head, and the spout grew into a tail, while out of the body sprang four paws, and in a few minutes the man found himself watching, not a kettle, but a tanuki! The creature jumped off the fire, and bounded about the room like a kitten, running up the walls and over the ceiling, till the old man was in an agony lest his pretty room should be spoilt  He cried to a neighbour for help, and between them they managed to catch the tanuki, and shut him up safely in a wooden chest  Then, quite exhausted, they sat down on the mats, and consulted together what they should do with this troublesome beast  At length they decided to sell him, and bade a child who was passing send them a certain tradesman called Jimmu  When Jimmu arrived, the old man told him that he had something which he wished to get rid of, and lifted the lid of the wooden chest, where he had shut up the tanuki  But, to his surprise, no tanuki was there, nothing but the kettle he had found in the corner  It was certainly very odd, but the man remembered what had taken place on the fire, and did not want to keep the kettle any more, so after a little bargaining about the price, Jimmu went away carrying the kettle with him  Now Jimmu had not gone very far before he felt that the kettle was getting heavier and heavier, and by the time he reached home he was so tired that he was thankful to put it down in the corner of his room, and then forgot all about it  In the middle of the night, however, he was awakened by a loud noise in the corner where the kettle stood, and raised himself up in bed to see what it was  But nothing was there except the kettle, which seemed quiet enough  He thought that he must have been dreaming, and fell asleep again, only to be roused a second time by the same disturbance  He jumped up and went to the corner, and by the light of the lamp that he always kept burning he saw that the kettle had become a tanuki, which was running round after his tail  After he grew weary of that, he ran on the balcony, where he turned several somersaults, from pure gladness of heart  The tradesman was much troubled as to what to do with the animal, and it was only towards morning that he managed to get any sleep; but when he opened his eyes again there was no tanuki, only the old kettle he had left there the night before  As soon as he had tidied his house, Jimmu set off to tell his story to a friend next door  The man listened quietly, and did not appear so surprised as Jimmu expected, for he recollected having heard, in his youth, something about a wonder-working kettle', " 'Go and travel with it, and show it off,' said he, 'and you will become a rich man; but be careful first to ask the tanuki's leave, and also to perform some magic ceremonies to prevent him from running away at the sight of the people", "' Jimmu thanked his friend for his counsel, which he followed exactly", " The tanuki's consent was obtained, a booth was built, and a notice was hung up outside it inviting the people to come and witness the most wonderful transformation that ever was seen", ' They came in crowds, and the kettle was passed from hand to hand, and they were allowed to examine it all over, and even to look inside  Then Jimmu took it back, and setting it on the platform, commanded it to become a tanuki  In an instant the handle began to change into a head, and the spout into a tail, while the four paws appeared at the sides  A long, long while ago, before ever the White Men were seen in Senna, there lived a man called Gopani-Kufa  One day, as he was out hunting, he came upon a strange sight', " An enormous python had caught an antelope and coiled itself around it; the antelope, striking out in despair with its horns, had pinned the python's neck to a tree, and so deeply had its horns sunk in the soft wood that neither creature could get away", " 'Help!' cried the antelope, 'for I was doing no harm, yet I have been caught, and would have been eaten, had I not defended myself", "' 'Help me,' said the python, 'for I am Insato, King of all the Reptiles, and will reward you well!' Gopani-Kufa considered for a moment, then stabbing the antelope with his assegai, he set the python free", " 'I thank you,' said the python; 'come back here with the new moon, when I shall have eaten the antelope, and I will reward you as I promised", "' 'Yes,' said the dying antelope, 'he will reward you, and lo! your reward shall be your own undoing!' Gopani-Kufa went back to his kraal, and with the new moon he returned again to the spot where he had saved the python", " Insato was lying upon the ground, still sleepy from the effects of his huge meal, and when he saw the man he thanked him again, and said: 'Come with me now to Pita, which is my own country, and I will give you what you will of all my possessions", "' Gopani-Kufa at first was afraid, thinking of what the antelope had said, but finally he consented and followed Insato into the forest", ' For several days they travelled, and at last they came to a hole leading deep into the earth  It was not very wide, but large enough to admit a man', " 'Hold on to my tail,' said Insato, 'and I will go down first, drawing you after me", "' The man did so, and Insato entered", ' Down, down, down they went for days, all the while getting deeper and deeper into the earth, until at last the darkness ended and they dropped into a beautiful country; around them grew short green grass, on which browsed herds of cattle and sheep and goats  In the distance Gopani-Kufa saw a great collection of houses all square, built of stone and very tall, and their roofs were shining with gold and burnished iron', " Gopani-Kufa turned to Insato, but found, in the place of the python, a man, strong and handsome, with the great snake's skin wrapped round him for covering; and on his arms and neck were rings of pure gold", ' The man smiled', " 'I am Insato,' said he, 'but in my own country I take man's shape--even as you see me--for this is Pita, the land over which I am king", "' He then took Gopani-Kufa by the hand and led him towards the town", ' On the way they passed rivers in which men and women were bathing and fishing and boating; and farther on they came to gardens covered with heavy crops of rice and maize, and many other grains which Gopani-Kufa did not even know the name of  And as they passed, the people who were singing at their work in the fields, abandoned their labours and saluted Insato with delight, bringing also palm wine and green cocoanuts for refreshment, as to one returned from a long journey', " 'These are my children!' said Insato, waving his hand towards the people", ' Gopani-Kufa was much astonished at all that he saw, but he said nothing  Presently they came to the town; everything here, too, was beautiful, and everything that a man might desire he could obtain  Even the grains of dust in the streets were of gold and silver  Insato conducted Gopani-Kufa to the palace, and showing him his rooms, and the maidens who would wait upon him, told him that they would have a great feast that night, and on the morrow he might name his choice of the riches of Pita and it should be given him  Then he was away  Now Gopani-Kufa had a wasp called Zengi-mizi  Zengi-mizi was not an ordinary wasp, for the spirit of the father of Gopani-Kufa had entered it, so that it was exceedingly wise', " In times of doubt Gopani-Kufa always consulted the wasp as to what had better be done, so on this occasion he took it out of the little rush basket in which he carried it, saying: 'Zengi-mizi, what gift shall I ask of Insato to-morrow when he would know the reward he shall bestow on me for saving his life?' 'Biz-z-z,' hummed Zengi-mizi, 'ask him for Sipao the Mirror" ,  ' Ibrahim, the most learned and pious man of the city, whom everybody held in esteem, fell on troubled days  To none did he speak of his sufferings, for he was proud and would have been compelled to refuse the help which he knew would have been offered to him  His noble wife and five faithful sons suffered in silence, but Ibrahim was sorely troubled when he saw their clothes wearing away to rags and their bodies wasting with hunger  One day Ibrahim was seated in front of the Holy Book, but he saw not the words on its pages  His eyes were dimmed with tears and his thoughts were far away  He was day-dreaming of a region where hunger and thirst and lack of clothes and shelter were unknown  He sighed heavily and his wife heard  "My dear husband," she said to him gently, "we are starving  You must go forth to seek work for the sake of our five little sons " "Yes, yes," he replied, sadly, "and for you, too, my devoted wife, but"--and he pointed to his tattered garments--"how can I go out in these? Who will employ a man so miserably clad?" "I will ask our kind neighbors to lend you some raiment," said his wife, and although he made some demur at first, she did so and was successful in obtaining the loan of a cloak which completely covered Ibrahim and restored to him his dignified appearance  His good wife cheered him with brave words  He took his staff and set out with head erect and his heart filled with a great hope  All people saluted the learned Ibrahim, for it was not often he was seen abroad in the busy streets of the city  He returned their greetings with kindly smiles, but halted not in his walk  He had no wish to make any claims upon his fellow citizens, who would no doubt have gladly assisted him  He desired to go among strangers and work so that he should not be beholden to anyone  Beyond the city gates, where the palm trees grew and the camels trudged lazily toward the distant desert, he was suddenly accosted by a stranger dressed as an Arab  "O learned and holy man of the city," he said, "command me, for I am thy slave " At the same time he made a low bow before Ibrahim  "My slave!" returned Ibrahim, in surprise  "You mock me, stranger  I am wretchedly poor  I seek but the opportunity to sell myself, even as a slave, to any man who will provide food and clothing for my wife and children " "Sell not thyself," said the Arab  "Offer me for sale instead  I am a marvelous builder  Behold these plans and models, specimens of my skill and handiwork " From beneath the folds of his ample robes, the Arab produced a scroll and a box and held them out to Ibrahim  The latter took them, wonderingly  On the scroll were traced designs of stately buildings  Once upon a time there lived an old couple who had one son called Martin', " Now when the old man's time had come, he stretched himself out on his bed and died", ' Though all his life long he had toiled and moiled, he only left his widow and son two hundred florins  The old woman determined to put by the money for a rainy day; but alas! the rainy day was close at hand, for their meal was all consumed, and who is prepared to face starvation with two hundred florins at their disposal? So the old woman counted out a hundred of her florins, and giving them to Martin, told him to go into the town and lay in a store of meal for a year  So Martin started off for the town  When he reached the meat-market he found the whole place in turmoil, and a great noise of angry voices and barking of dogs  Mixing in the crowd, he noticed a stag-hound which the butchers had caught and tied to a post, and which was being flogged in a merciless manner', " Overcome with pity, Martin spoke to the butchers, saying: 'Friends, why are you beating the poor dog so cruelly?' 'We have every right to beat him,' they replied; 'he has just devoured a newly-killed pig", "' 'Leave off beating him,' said Martin, 'and sell him to me instead", "' 'If you choose to buy him,' answered the butchers derisively; 'but for such a treasure we won't take a penny less than a hundred florins", "' 'A hundred!' exclaimed Martin", " 'Well, so be it, if you will not take less;' and, taking the money out of his pocket, he handed it over in exchange for the dog, whose name was Schurka", " When Martin got home, his mother met him with the question: 'Well, what have you bought?' 'Schurka, the dog,' replied Martin, pointing to his new possession", ' Whereupon his mother became very angry, and abused him roundly  He ought to be ashamed of himself, when there was scarcely a handful of meal in the house, to have spent the money on a useless brute like that', " On the following day she sent him back to the town, saying, 'Here, take our last hundred florins, and buy provisions with them", " I have just emptied the last grains of meal out of the chest, and baked a bannock; but it won't last over to-morrow", "' Just as Martin was entering the town he met a rough-looking peasant who was dragging a cat after him by a string which was fastened round the poor beast's neck", " 'Stop,' cried Martin; 'where are you dragging that poor cat?' 'I mean to drown him,' was the answer", " 'What harm has the poor beast done?' said Martin", " 'It has just killed a goose,' replied the peasant", " 'Don't drown him, sell him to me instead,' begged Martin", " 'Not for a hundred florins,' was the answer", " 'Surely for a hundred florins you'll sell it?' said Martin", " 'See! here is the money;' and, so saying, he handed him the hundred florins, which the peasant pocketed, and Martin took possession of the cat, which was called Waska", " When he reached his home his mother greeted him with the question: 'Well, what have you brought back?' 'I have brought this cat, Waska,' answered Martin", " 'And what besides?' 'I had no money over to buy anything else with,' replied Martin", " 'You useless ne'er-do-weel!' exclaimed his mother in a great passion", " 'Leave the house at once, and go and beg your bread among strangers;' and as Martin did not dare to contradict her, he called Schurka and Waska and started off with them to the nearest village in search of work", ' On the way he met a rich peasant, who asked him where he was going  In a little village in the country of Japan there lived long, long ago a man and his wife  For many years they were happy and prosperous, but bad times came, and at last nothing was left them but their daughter, who was as beautiful as the morning  The neighbours were very kind, and would have done anything they could to help their poor friends, but the old couple felt that since everything had changed they would rather go elsewhere, so one day they set off to bury themselves in the country, taking their daughter with them  Now the mother and daughter had plenty to do in keeping the house clean and looking after the garden, but the man would sit for hours together gazing straight in front of him, and thinking of the riches that once were his  Each day he grew more and more wretched, till at length he took to his bed and never got up again  His wife and daughter wept bitterly for his loss, and it was many months before they could take pleasure in anything  Then one morning the mother suddenly looked at the girl, and found that she had grown still more lovely than before  Once her heart would have been glad at the sight, but now that they two were alone in the world she feared some harm might come of it  So, like a good mother, she tried to teach her daughter all she knew, and to bring her up to be always busy, so that she would never have time to think about herself', " And the girl was a good girl, and listened to all her mother's lessons, and so the years passed away", ' At last one wet spring the mother caught cold, and though in the beginning she did not pay much attention to it, she gradually grew more and more ill, and knew that she had not long to live  Then she called her daughter and told her that very soon she would be alone in the world; that she must take care of herself, as there would be no one to take care of her  And because it was more difficult for beautiful women to pass unheeded than for others, she bade her fetch a wooden helmet out of the next room, and put it on her head, and pull it low down over her brows, so that nearly the whole of her face should lie in its shadow  The girl did as she was bid, and her beauty was so hidden beneath the wooden cap, which covered up all her hair, that she might have gone through any crowd, and no one would have looked twice at her  And when she saw this the heart of the mother was at rest, and she lay back in her bed and died  The girl wept for many days, but by-and-by she felt that, being alone in the world, she must go and get work, for she had only herself to depend upon  There was none to be got by staying where she was, so she made her clothes into a bundle, and walked over the hills till she reached the house of the man who owned the fields in that part of the country  And she took service with him and laboured for him early and late, and every night when she went to bed she was at peace, for she had not forgotten one thing that she had promised her mother; and, however hot the sun might be, she always kept the wooden helmet on her head, and the people gave her the nickname of Hatschihime  In spite, however, of all her care the fame of her beauty spread abroad: many of the impudent young men that are always to be found in the world stole softly up behind her while she was at work, and tried to lift off the wooden helmet  But the girl would have nothing to say to them, and only bade them be off; then they began to talk to her, but she never answered them, and went on with what she was doing, though her wages were low and food not very plentiful  Still she could manage to live, and that was enough  One day her master happened to pass through the field where she was working, and was struck by her industry and stopped to watch her  After a while he put one or two questions to her, and then led her into his house, and told her that henceforward her only duty should be to tend his sick wife  From this time the girl felt as if all her troubles were ended, but the worst of them was yet to come  Not very long after Hatschihime had become maid to the sick woman, the eldest son of the house returned home from Kioto, where he had been studying all sorts of things  He was tired of the splendours of the town and its pleasures, and was glad enough to be back in the green country, among the peach-blossoms and sweet flowers  Strolling about in the early morning, he caught sight of the girl with the odd wooden helmet on her head, and immediately he went to his mother to ask who she was, and where she came from, and why she wore that strange thing over her face  His mother answered that it was a whim, and nobody could persuade her to lay it aside; whereat the young man laughed, but kept his thoughts to himself', " One hot day, however, he happened to be going towards home when he caught sight of his mother's waiting maid kneeling by a little stream that flowed through the garden, splashing some water over her face", " The helmet was pushed on one side, and as the youth stood watching from behind a tree he had a glimpse of the girl's great beauty; and he determined that no one else should be his wife" ,  ' It was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and not a breeze stirred  "Bump"--an old pot was thrown at a neighbor\'s door; and "bang, bang," went the guns; for they were greeting the New Year', " It was New Year's Eve, and the church clock was striking twelve", ' "Tan-ta-ra-ra, tan-ta-ra-ra," sounded the horn, and the mail-coach came lumbering up  The clumsy vehicle stopped at the gate of the town; all the places had been taken, for there were twelve passengers in the coach  "Hurrah! hurrah!" cried the people in the town; for in every house the New Year was being welcomed; and as the clock struck, they stood up, the full glasses in their hands, to drink success to the new comer  "A happy New Year," was the cry; "a pretty wife, plenty of money, and no sorrow or care " The wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together till they rang again; while before the town-gate the mail coach stopped with the twelve strange passengers  And who were these strangers? Each of them had his passport and his luggage with him; they even brought presents for me, and for you, and for all the people in the town  "Who were they? what did they want? and what did they bring with them?" "Good-morning," they cried to the sentry at the town-gate  "Good-morning," replied the sentry; for the clock had struck twelve  "Your name and profession?" asked the sentry of the one who alighted first from the carriage  "See for yourself in the passport," he replied  "I am myself;" and a famous fellow he looked, arrayed in bear-skin and fur boots  "I am the man on whom many persons fix their hopes', " Come to me to-morrow, and I'll give you a New Year's present", ' I throw shillings and pence among the people; I give balls, no less than thirty-one; indeed, that is the highest number I can spare for balls  My ships are often frozen in, but in my offices it is warm and comfortable  My name is JANUARY', " I'm a merchant, and I generally bring my accounts with me", '" Then the second alighted  He seemed a merry fellow  He was a director of a theatre, a manager of masked balls, and a leader of all the amusements we can imagine  His luggage consisted of a great cask  "We\'ll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time," said he; "I\'ll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too  Unfortunately I have not long to live--the shortest time, in fact, of my whole family--only twenty-eight days  Sometimes they pop me in a day extra; but I trouble myself very little about that  Hurrah!" "You must not shout so," said the sentry  "Certainly I may shout," retorted the man; "I\'m Prince Carnival, travelling under the name of FEBRUARY " The third now got out  A mandarin once lived in Kiang-ho who was so exceedingly cross and disagreeable that everyone hated him  He snarled and stormed at every person he met and was never known to laugh or be merry under any circumstances  Especially he hated boys and girls; for the boys jeered at him, which aroused his wrath, and the girls made fun of him, which hurt his pride  When he had become so unpopular that no one would speak to him, the emperor heard about it and commanded him to emigrate to America  This suited the mandarin very well; but before he left China he stole the Great Book of Magic that belonged to the wise magician Haot-sai  Then, gathering up his little store of money, he took ship for America  He settled in a city of the middle west and of course started a laundry, since that seems to be the natural vocation of every Chinaman, be he coolie or mandarin  He made no acquaintances with the other Chinamen of the town, who, when they met him and saw the red button in his hat, knew him for a real mandarin and bowed low before him  He put up a red and white sign and people brought their laundry to him and got paper checks, with Chinese characters upon them, in exchange, this being the only sort of character the mandarin had left  One day as the ugly one was ironing in his shop in the basement of 263 1/2 Main street, he looked up and saw a crowd of childish faces pressed against the window  Most Chinamen make friends with children; this one hated them and tried to drive them away  But as soon as he returned to his work they were back at the window again, mischievously smiling down upon him  The naughty mandarin uttered horrid words in the Manchu language and made fierce gestures; but this did no good at all  The children stayed as long as they pleased, and they came again the very next day as soon as school was over, and likewise the next day, and the next  For they saw their presence at the window bothered the Chinaman and were delighted accordingly  The following day being Sunday the children did not appear, but as the mandarin, being a heathen, worked in his little shop a big butterfly flew in at the open door and fluttered about the room  The mandarin closed the door and chased the butterfly until he caught it, when he pinned it against the wall by sticking two pins through its beautiful wings  This did not hurt the butterfly, there being no feeling in its wings; but it made him a safe prisoner  This butterfly was of large size and its wings were exquisitely marked by gorgeous colors laid out in regular designs like the stained glass windows of a cathedral  The mandarin now opened his wooden chest and drew forth the Great Book of Magic he had stolen from Haot-sai  Turning the pages slowly he came to a passage describing "How to understand the language of butterflies " This he read carefully and then mixed a magic formula in a tin cup and drank it down with a wry face  Immediately thereafter he spoke to the butterfly in its own language, saying: "Why did you enter this room?" "I smelled bees-wax," answered the butterfly; "therefore I thought I might find honey here " "But you are my prisoner," said the mandarin  "If I please I can kill you, or leave you on the wall to starve to death " "I expect that," replied the butterfly, with a sigh  "But my race is shortlived, anyway; it doesn\'t matter whether death comes sooner or later " "Yet you like to live, do you not?" asked the mandarin  "Yet; life is pleasant and the world is beautiful  I do not seek death  Once upon a time there were seven brothers, who were orphans, and had no sister  Therefore they were obliged to do all their own housework  This they did not like at all; so after much deliberation they decided to get married  There were, unfortunately, no young girls to be found in the place where they lived; but the elder brothers agreed to go out into the world and seek for brides, promising to bring back a very pretty wife for the youngest also if he would meanwhile stay at home and take care of the house  He consented willingly, and the six young men set off in good spirits', " On their way they came to a small cottage standing quite by itself in a wood; and before the door stood an old, old man, who accosted the brothers saying, 'Hullo, you young fellows! Whither away so fast and cheerily?' 'We are going to find bonny brides for ourselves, and one for our youngest brother at home,' they replied", " 'Oh! dear youths,' said the old man, 'I am terribly lonely here; pray bring a bride for me also; only remember, she must be young and pretty", "' 'What does a shrivelled old grey thing like that want with a pretty young bride?' thought the brothers, and went on their way", ' Presently they came to a town where were seven sisters, as young and as lovely as anyone could wish  Each brother chose one, and the youngest they kept for their brother at home', " Then the whole party set out on the return journey, and again their path led through the wood and past the old man's cottage", " There he stood before the door, and cried: 'Oh! you fine fellows, what a charming bride you have brought me!' 'She is not for you, said the young men", " 'She is for our youngest brother, as we promised", "' 'What!' said the old man, 'promised! I'll make you eat your promises!' And with that he took his magic wand, and, murmuring a charm, he touched both brothers and brides, and immediately they were turned into grey stones", ' Only the youngest sister he had not bewitched  He took her into the cottage, and from that time she was obliged to keep house for him  She was not very unhappy, but one thought troubled her', " What if the old man should die and leave her here alone in the solitary cottage deep in the heart of the wood! She would be as 'terribly lonely' as he had formerly been", ' One day she told him of her fear', " 'Don't be anxious,' he said", " 'You need neither fear my death nor desire it, for I have no heart in my breast! However, if I should die, you will find my wand above the door, and with it you can set free your sisters and their lovers", ' Then you will surely have company enough', "' 'Where in all the world do you keep your heart, if not in your breast?' asked the girl", " 'Do you want to know everything?' her husband said", " 'Well, if you must know, my heart is in the bed-cover", "' When the old man had gone out about his business his bride passed her time in embroidering beautiful flowers on the bed quilt to make his heart happy", ' The old man was much amused', " He laughed, and said to her: 'You are a good child, but I was only joking", " My heart is really in--in--' 'Now where is it, dear husband?' 'It is in the doorway,' he replied", ' Next day, while he was out, the girl decorated the door with gay feathers and fresh flowers, and hung garlands upon it  The storks relate to their little ones a great many stories, and they are all about moors and reed banks, and suited to their age and capacity  The youngest of them are quite satisfied with "kribble, krabble," or such nonsense, and think it very grand; but the elder ones want something with a deeper meaning, or at least something about their own family', " We are only acquainted with one of the two longest and oldest stories which the storks relate--it is about Moses, who was exposed by his mother on the banks of the Nile, and was found by the king's daughter, who gave him a good education, and he afterwards became a great man; but where he was buried is still unknown", ' Every one knows this story, but not the second; very likely because it is quite an inland story  It has been repeated from mouth to mouth, from one stork-mamma to another, for thousands of years; and each has told it better than the last; and now we mean to tell it better than all', " The first stork pair who related it lived at the time it happened, and had their summer residence on the rafters of the Viking's house, which stood near the wild moorlands of Wendsyssell; that is, to speak more correctly, the great moorheath, high up in the north of Jutland, by the Skjagen peak", ' This wilderness is still an immense wild heath of marshy ground, about which we can read in the "Official Directory " It is said that in olden times the place was a lake, the ground of which had heaved up from beneath, and now the moorland extends for miles in every direction, and is surrounded by damp meadows, trembling, undulating swamps, and marshy ground covered with turf, on which grow bilberry bushes and stunted trees  Mists are almost always hovering over this region, which, seventy years ago, was overrun with wolves  It may well be called the Wild Moor; and one can easily imagine, with such a wild expanse of marsh and lake, how lonely and dreary it must have been a thousand years ago  Many things may be noticed now that existed then  The reeds grow to the same height, and bear the same kind of long, purple-brown leaves, with their feathery tips  There still stands the birch, with its white bark and its delicate, loosely hanging leaves; and with regard to the living beings who frequented this spot, the fly still wears a gauzy dress of the same cut, and the favorite colors of the stork are white, with black and red for stockings  The people, certainly, in those days, wore very different dresses to those they now wear, but if any of them, be he huntsman or squire, master or servant, ventured on the wavering, undulating, marshy ground of the moor, they met with the same fate a thousand years ago as they would now  The wanderer sank, and went down to the Marsh King, as he is named, who rules in the great moorland empire beneath  They also called him "Gunkel King," but we like the name of "Marsh King" better, and we will give him that name as the storks do', " Very little is known of the Marsh King's rule, but that, perhaps, is a good thing", ' In the neighborhood of the moorlands, and not far from the great arm of the North Sea and the Cattegat which is called the Lumfjorden, lay the castle of the Viking, with its water-tight stone cellars, its tower, and its three projecting storeys  On the ridge of the roof the stork had built his nest, and there the stork-mamma sat on her eggs and felt sure her hatching would come to something  One evening, stork-papa stayed out rather late, and when he came home he seemed quite busy, bustling, and important  "I have something very dreadful to tell you," said he to the stork-mamma  "Keep it to yourself then," she replied  "Remember that I am hatching eggs; it may agitate me, and will affect them " "You must know it at once," said he  "The daughter of our host in Egypt has arrived here  She has ventured to take this journey, and now she is lost " "She who sprung from the race of the fairies, is it?" cried the mother stork  "Oh, tell me all about it; you know I cannot bear to be kept waiting at a time when I am hatching eggs " "Well, you see, mother," he replied, "she believed what the doctors said, and what I have heard you state also, that the moor-flowers which grow about here would heal her sick father; and she has flown to the north in swan\'s plumage, in company with some other swan-princesses, who come to these parts every year to renew their youth  She came, and where is she now!" "You enter into particulars too much," said the mamma stork, "and the eggs may take cold; I cannot bear such suspense as this  THERE was once upon a time a marvellous musician  One day he was wandering through a wood all by himself, thinking now of one thing, now of another, till there was nothing else left to think about', " Then he said to himself: 'Time hangs very heavily on my hands when I'm all alone in the wood", ' I must try and find a pleasant companion', "' So he took his fiddle out, and fiddled till he woke the echoes round", ' After a time a wolf came through the thicket and trotted up to the musician', " 'Oh! it's a Wolf, is it?' said he", " 'I've not the smallest wish for his society", "' But the Wolf approached him and said: 'Oh, my dear musician, how beautifully you play! I wish you'd teach me how it's done", "' 'That's easily learned,' answered the fiddler; 'you must only do exactly as I tell you", "' 'Of course I will,' replied the Wolf", " 'I can promise that you will find me a most apt pupil", "' So they joined company and went on their way together, and after a time they came to an old oak tree, which was hollow and had a crack in the middle of the trunk", " 'Now,' said the Musician, 'if you want to learn to fiddle, here's your chance", ' Lay your front paws in this crack', "' The Wolf did as he was told, and the Musician quickly seized a stone, and wedged both his fore paws so firmly into the crack that he was held there, a fast prisoner", " 'Wait there till I return,' said the Fiddler, and he went on his way", " After a time he said to himself again: 'Time hangs very heavily on my hands when I'm all alone in the wood; I must try and find a companion", "' So he drew out his fiddle, and fiddled away lustily", ' Presently a fox slunk through the trees', " 'Aha I what have we here?' said the Musician", " 'A fox; well, I haven't the smallest desire for his company", "' The Fox came straight up to him and said: 'My dear friend, how beautifully you play the fiddle; I would like to learn how you do it", "' 'Nothing easier,' said the Musician, 'if you'll promise to do exactly as I tell you", "' 'Certainly,' answered the Fox, 'you have only to say the word", "' 'Well, then, follow me,' replied the Fiddler", ' When they had gone a bit of the way, they came to a path with high trees on each side  Here the Musician halted, bent a stout hazel bough down to the ground from one side of the path, and put his foot on the end of it to keep it down', " Then he bent a branch down from the other side and said: 'Give me your left front paw, my little Fox, if you really wish to learn how it's done", "' The Fox did as he was told, and the Musician tied his front paw to the end of one of the branches" ,  ' There was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat  The partition was soon made  Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for  They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony  The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat  The poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot  "My brothers," said he, "may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger " The Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air: "Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro\' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine " Tho\' the Cat\'s master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition  When the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits  He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it  Scarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity  Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty  He was shewed up stairs into the King\'s apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him: "I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) "has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him " "Tell thy master," said the King, "that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure " Another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both  He went and made a present of these to the King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren  The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink', " The Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking", ' One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master: "If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall shew you, and leave the rest to me " The Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore  While he was washing, the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out, as loud as he could: "Help, help, my lord Marquis of Carabas is drowning " At this noise the King put his head out of his coach-window, and finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the Marquis of Carabas  While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach, and told the King that while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, tho\' he had cried out "Thieves, thieves," several times, as loud as he could  This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone  The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord Marquis of Carabas', " The King received him with great kindness, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made, and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances, but she fell in love with him to distraction", ' The King would needs have him come into his coach, and take part of the airing  The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them: "Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King, that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat " The King did not fail asking of the mowers, to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged  THERE was once upon a time a husbandman who had three sons  He had no property to bequeath to them, and no means of putting them in the way of getting a living, and did not know what to do, so he said that they had his leave to take to anything they most fancied, and go to any place they best liked  He would gladly accompany them for some part of their way, he said, and that he did  He went with them till they came to a place where three roads met, and there each of them took his own way, and the father bade them farewell and returned to his own home again  What became of the two elder I have never been able to discover, but the youngest went both far and wide  It came to pass, one night, as he was going through a great wood, that a terrible storm came on  It blew so hard and rained so heavily that he could scarcely keep his eyes open, and before he was aware of it he had got quite out of the track, and could neither find road nor path  But he went on, and at last he saw a light far away in the wood  Then he thought he must try and get to it, and after a long, long time he did reach it  There was a large house, and the fire was burning so brightly inside that he could tell that the people were not in bed  So he went in, and inside there was an old woman who was busy about some work', " 'Good evening, mother!' said the youth", " 'Good evening!' said the old woman", " 'Hutetu! it is terrible weather outside to-night,' said the young fellow", " 'Indeed it is,' said the old woman", " 'Can I sleep here, and have shelter for the night?' asked the youth", " 'It wouldn't be good for you to sleep here,' said the old hag, 'for if the people of the house come home and find you, they will kill both you and me", "' 'What kind of people are they then, who dwell here?' said the youth", " 'Oh! robbers, and rabble of that sort,' said the old woman; 'they stole me away when I was little, and I have had to keep house for them ever since", "' 'I still think I will go to bed, all the same,' said the youth", " 'No matter what happens, I'll not go out to-night in such weather as this", "' 'Well, then, it will be the worse for yourself,' said the old woman", " The young man lay down in a bed which stood near, but he dared not go to sleep: and it was better that he didn't, for the robbers came, and the old woman said that a young fellow who was a stranger had come there, and she had not been able to get him to go away again", " 'Did you see if he had any money?' said the robbers", " 'He's not one to have money, he is a tramp! If he has a few clothes to his back, that is all", "' Then the robbers began to mutter to each other apart about what they should do with him, whether they should murder him, or what else they should do", ' In the meantime the boy got up and began to talk to them, and ask them if they did not want a man-servant, for he could find pleasure enough in serving them', " 'Yes,' said they, 'if you have a mind to take to the trade that we follow, you may have a place here", "' 'It's all the same to me what trade I follow,' said the youth, 'for when I came away from home my father gave me leave to take to any trade I fancied", "' 'Have you a fancy for stealing, then?' said the robbers" ,  ' Long, long ago, there lived a king who ruled over a country by the sea  When he had been married about a year, some of his subjects, inhabiting a distant group of islands, revolted against his laws, and it became needful for him to leave his wife and go in person to settle their disputes  The queen feared that some ill would come of it, and implored him to stay at home, but he told her that nobody could do his work for him, and the next morning the sails were spread, and the king started on his voyage  The vessel had not gone very far when she ran upon a rock, and stuck so fast in a cleft that the strength of the whole crew could not get her off again  To make matters worse, the wind was rising too, and it was quite plain that in a few hours the ship would be dashed to pieces and everybody would be drowned, when suddenly the form of a mermaid was seen dancing on the waves which threatened every moment to overwhelm them', " 'There is only one way to free yourselves,' she said to the king, bobbing up and down in the water as she spoke, 'and that is to give me your solemn word that you will deliver to me the first child that is born to you", "' The king hesitated at this proposal", " He hoped that some day he might have children in his home, and the thought that he must yield up the heir to his crown was very bitter to him; but just then a huge wave broke with great force on the ship's side, and his men fell on their knees and entreated him to save them", ' So he promised, and this time a wave lifted the vessel clean off the rocks, and she was in the open sea once more  The affairs of the islands took longer to settle than the king had expected, and some months passed away before he returned to his palace  In his absence a son had been born to him, and so great was his joy that he quite forgot the mermaid and the price he had paid for the safety of his ship  But as the years went on, and the baby grew into a fine big boy, the remembrance of it came back, and one day he told the queen the whole story  From that moment the happiness of both their lives was ruined  Every night they went to bed wondering if they should find his room empty in the morning, and every day they kept him by their sides, expecting him to be snatched away before their very eyes', " At last the king felt that this state of things could not continue, and he said to his wife: 'After all, the most foolish thing in the world one can do is to keep the boy here in exactly the place in which the mermaid will seek him", ' Let us give him food and send him on his travels, and perhaps, if the mermaid ever blocs come to seek him, she may be content with some other child', "' And the queen agreed that his plan seemed the wisest", ' So the boy was called, and his father told him the story of the voyage, as he had told his mother before him  The prince listened eagerly, and was delighted to think that he was to go away all by himself to see the world, and was not in the least frightened; for though he was now sixteen, he had scarcely been allowed to walk alone beyond the palace gardens  He began busily to make his preparations, and took off his smart velvet coat, putting on instead one of green cloth, while he refused a beautiful bag which the queen offered him to hold his food, and slung a leather knapsack over his shoulders instead, just as he had seen other travellers do  Then he bade farewell to his parents and went his way  All through the day he walked, watching with interest the strange birds and animals that darted across his path in the forest or peeped at him from behind a bush  But as evening drew on he became tired, and looked about as he walked for some place where he could sleep  At length he reached a soft mossy bank under a tree, and was just about to stretch himself out on it, when a fearful roar made him start and tremble all over  In another moment something passed swiftly through the air and a lion stood before him', " 'What are you doing here?' asked the lion, his eyes glaring fiercely at the boy", " 'I am flying from the mermaid,' the prince answered, in a quaking voice", " 'Give me some food then,' said the lion, 'it is past my supper time, and I am very hungry", "' The boy was so thankful that the lion did not want to eat him, that he gladly picked up his knapsack which lay on the ground, and held out some bread and a flask of wine", " 'I feel better now,' said the lion when he had done, 'so now I shall go to sleep on this nice soft moss, and if you like you can lie down beside me" ,  ' There lay three houses in a row, in one of which there lived a tailor, in another a carpenter, and in the third a smith  All three were married, and their wives were very good friends  They often talked about how stupid their husbands were, but they could never agree as to which of them had the most stupid one; each one stuck up for her own husband, and maintained that it was he  The three wives went to church together every Sunday, and had a regular good gossip on the way, and when they were coming home from church they always turned into the tavern which lay by the wayside and drank half a pint together  This was at the time when half a pint of brandy cost threepence, so that was just a penny from each of them  But the brandy went up in price, and the taverner said that he must have fourpence for the half-pint  They were greatly annoyed at this, for there were only the three of them to share it, and none of them was willing to pay the extra penny', " As they went home from the church that day they decided to wager with each other as to whose husband was the most stupid, and the one who, on the following Sunday, should be judged to have played her husband the greatest trick should thereafter go free from paying, and each of the two others would give twopence for their Sunday's half-pint", " Next day the tailor's wife said to her husband, 'I have some girls coming to-day to help to card my wool there is a great deal to do, and we must be very busy", ' I am so annoyed that our watchdog is dead, for in the evening the young fellows will come about to get fun with the girls, and they will get nothing done  If we had only had a fierce watchdog he would have kept them away', "' 'Yes,' said the man, 'that would have been a good thing", "' 'Listen, good man,' said the wife, 'you must just be the watchdog yourself, and scare the fellows away from the house", "' The husband was not very sure about this, although otherwise he was always ready to give in to her", " 'Oh yes, you will see it will work all right,' said the wife", " And so towards evening she got the tailor dressed up in a shaggy fur coat, tied a black woollen cloth round his head, and chained him up beside the dog's kennel", "' There he stood and barked and growled at everyone that moved in his neighbourhood", ' The neighbour wives knew all about this, and were greatly amused at it', " On the day after this the carpenter had been out at work, and came home quite merry; but as soon as he entered the house his wife clapped her hands together and cried, 'My dear, what makes you look like that? You are ill", "' The carpenter knew nothing about being ill; he only thought that he wanted something to eat, so he sat down at the table and began his dinner", ' His wife sat straight in front of him, with her hands folded, and shook her head, and looked at him with an anxious air', " 'You are getting worse, my dear,' she said; 'you are quite pale now; you have a serious illness about you; I can see it by your looks", "' The husband now began to grow anxious, and thought that perhaps he was not quite well", " 'No, indeed,' said she; 'it's high time that you were in bed", "' She then got him to lie down, and piled above him all the bedclothes she could find, and gave him various medicines, while he grew worse and worse", " 'You will never get over it,' said she; 'I am afraid you are going to die", "' 'Do you think so?' said the carpenter; 'I can well believe it, for I am indeed very poorly", "' In a little while she said again, 'Ah, now I must part with you", ' Here comes Death  Now I must close your eyes  In the city of Florence, not far from the Piazza del Granduca, runs a little street called Porta Rosa  In this street, just in front of the market-place where vegetables are sold, stands a pig, made of brass and curiously formed  The bright color has been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the animal, to drink  It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lips against its jaws  Every one who visits Florence can very quickly find the place; he has only to ask the first beggar he meets for the Metal Pig, and he will be told where it is', " It was late on a winter evening; the mountains were covered with snow, but the moon shone brightly, and moonlight in Italy is like a dull winter's day in the north; indeed it is better, for clear air seems to raise us above the earth, while in the north a cold, gray, leaden sky appears to press us down to earth, even as the cold damp earth shall one day press on us in the grave", " In the garden of the grand duke's palace, under the roof of one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still suffering", ' He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out  He stood a long time musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno, and looking at the glittering stars, reflected in the water which flowed between him and the elegant marble bridge Della Trinita  He then walked away towards the Metal Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh water  Close by, lay a few salad-leaves and two chestnuts, which were to serve for his supper', " No one was in the street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep", ' It was midnight  The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and the boy heard him say quite distinctly, "Hold tight, little boy, for I am going to run;" and away he started for a most wonderful ride', " First, they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca, and the metal horse which bears the duke's statue, neighed aloud", " The painted coats-of-arms on the old council-house shone like transparent pictures, and Michael Angelo's David tossed his sling; it was as if everything had life", ' The metallic groups of figures, among which were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble square  By the Palazzo degli Uffizi, in the arcade, where the nobility assemble for the carnival, the Metal Pig stopped  "Hold fast," said the animal; "hold fast, for I am going up stairs " The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid  They entered a long gallery, where the boy had been before  The walls were resplendent with paintings; here stood statues and busts, all in a clear light as if it were day  But the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but to-night everything shone in its brightest colors  Here stood the figure of a beautiful woman, as beautifully sculptured as possible by one of the great masters  Her graceful limbs appeared to move; dolphins sprang at her feet, and immortality shone from her eyes', " The world called her the Venus de' Medici", ' By her side were statues, in which the spirit of life breathed in stone; figures of men, one of whom whetted his sword, and was named the Grinder; wrestling gladiators formed another group, the sword had been sharpened for them, and they strove for the goddess of beauty  The boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for the walls were gleaming with bright colors, all appeared living reality  As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the other, the little boy could see it all plainly', " One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight" ,  ' Curdie went home whistling  He resolved to say nothing about the princess for fear of getting the nurse into trouble, for while he enjoyed teasing her because of her absurdity, he was careful not to do her any harm  He saw no more of the goblins, and was soon fast asleep in his bed  He woke in the middle of the night, and thought he heard curious noises outside  He sat up and listened; then got up, and, opening the door very quietly, went out  When he peeped round the corner, he saw, under his own window, a group of stumpy creatures, whom he at once recognized by their shape', " Hardly, however, had he begun his 'One, two, three!' when they broke asunder, scurried away, and were out of sight", ' He returned laughing, got into bed again, and was fast asleep in a moment  Reflecting a little over the matter in the morning, he came to the conclusion that, as nothing of the kind had ever happened before, they must be annoyed with him for interfering to protect the princess  By the time he was dressed, however, he was thinking of something quite different, for he did not value the enmity of the goblins in the least  As soon as they had had breakfast, he set off with his father for the mine  They entered the hill by a natural opening under a huge rock, where a little stream rushed out  They followed its course for a few yards, when the passage took a turn, and sloped steeply into the heart of the hill  With many angles and windings and branchings-off, and sometimes with steps where it came upon a natural gulf, it led them deep into the hill before they arrived at the place where they were at present digging out the precious ore  This was of various kinds, for the mountain was very rich in the better sorts of metals  With flint and steel, and tinder-box, they lighted their lamps, then fixed them on their heads, and were soon hard at work with their pickaxes and shovels and hammers  Father and son were at work near each other, but not in the same gang--the passages out of which the ore was dug, they called gangs--for when the lode, or vein of ore, was small, one miner would have to dig away alone in a passage no bigger than gave him just room to work--sometimes in uncomfortable cramped positions  If they stopped for a moment they could hear everywhere around them, some nearer, some farther off, the sounds of their companions burrowing away in all directions in the inside of the great mountain--some boring holes in the rock in order to blow it up with gunpowder, others shovelling the broken ore into baskets to be carried to the mouth of the mine, others hitting away with their pickaxes  Sometimes, if the miner was in a very lonely part, he would hear only a tap-tapping, no louder than that of a woodpecker, for the sound would come from a great distance off through the solid mountain rock  The work was hard at best, for it is very warm underground; but it was not particularly unpleasant, and some of the miners, when they wanted to earn a little more money for a particular purpose, would stop behind the rest and work all night  But you could not tell night from day down there, except from feeling tired and sleepy; for no light of the sun ever came into those gloomy regions  Some who had thus remained behind during the night, although certain there were none of their companions at work, would declare the next morning that they heard, every time they halted for a moment to take breath, a tap-tapping all about them, as if the mountain were then more full of miners than ever it was during the day; and some in consequence would never stay overnight, for all knew those were the sounds of the goblins', " They worked only at night, for the miners' night was the goblins' day", ' Indeed, the greater number of the miners were afraid of the goblins; for there were strange stories well known amongst them of the treatment some had received whom the goblins had surprised at their work during the night  The more courageous of them, however, amongst them Peter Peterson and Curdie, who in this took after his father, had stayed in the mine all night again and again, and although they had several times encountered a few stray goblins, had never yet failed in driving them away  As I have indicated already, the chief defence against them was verse, for they hated verse of every kind, and some kinds they could not endure at all  I suspect they could not make any themselves, and that was why they disliked it so much  At all events, those who were most afraid of them were those who could neither make verses themselves nor remember the verses that other people made for them; while those who were never afraid were those who could make verses for themselves; for although there were certain old rhymes which were very effectual, yet it was well known that a new rhyme, if of the right sort, was even more distasteful to them, and therefore more effectual in putting them to flight  Perhaps my readers may be wondering what the goblins could be about, working all night long, seeing they never carried up the ore and sold it; but when I have informed them concerning what Curdie learned the very next night, they will be able to understand  For Curdie had determined, if his father would permit him, to remain there alone this night--and that for two reasons: first, he wanted to get extra wages that he might buy a very warm red petticoat for his mother, who had begun to complain of the cold of the mountain air sooner than usual this autumn; and second, he had just a faint hope of finding out what the goblins were about under his window the night before  In a big forest in the north of America lived a quantity of wild animals of all sorts  They were always very polite when they met; but, in spite of that, they kept a close watch one upon the other, as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else  But their manners were so good that no one would ever had guessed that  One day a smart young wolf went out to hunt, promising his grandfather and grandmother that he would be sure to be back before bedtime  He trotted along quite happily through the forest till he came to a favourite place of his, just where the river runs into the sea  There, just as he had hoped, he saw the chief mink fishing in a canoe', " 'I want to fish too,' cried the wolf", ' But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear', " 'I wish you would take me into your boat!' shouted the wolf, louder than before, and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it, and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in", " 'Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset,' said the mink; 'and if you care about sea-urchins' eggs, you will find plenty in that basket", ' But be sure you eat only the white ones, for the red ones would kill you', "' So the wolf, who was always hungry, began to eat the eggs greedily; and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap", " 'Well, then, stretch yourself out, and rest your head on that piece of wood,' said the mink", ' And the wolf did as he was bid, and was soon fast asleep  Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife, and he died without moving  After that he landed on the beach, skinned the wolf, and taking the skin to his cottage, he hung it up before the fire to dry', " Not many days later the wolf's grandmother, who, with the help of her relations, had been searching for him everywhere, entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins' eggs, and saw the skin, which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson", " 'I knew he was dead--I knew it! I knew it!' she cried, weeping bitterly, till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet", ' So, half-blinded by her tears, the old woman went home the way she had come, and running in at the door, she flung herself down in front of the fire', " 'What are you crying for?' asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him", " 'I shall never see my grandson any more!' answered she", " 'Mink has killed him, oh! oh!' And putting her head down, she began to weep as loudly as ever", " 'There! there!' said her husband, laying his paw on her shoulder", " 'Be comforted; if he IS dead, we will avenge him", "' And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan", ' It took them a long time to make up their minds, as one wolf proposed one thing and one another; but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house, and that the mink should be invited to the party  And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him  Now the wolves thought they were very cunning, but the mink was more cunning still; and though he sent a message by a white hare, that was going that way, saying he should be delighted to be present, he determined that he would take his precautions  So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn, and greeted her with his best bow', " 'I have a favour to ask of you, friend mouse,' said he, 'and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill" ,  ' Long years ago in old Japan there lived in the Province of Echigo, a very remote part of Japan even in these days, a man and his wife  When this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter  She was the joy and pride of both their lives, and in her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age', " What golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood; the visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old, her proud mother carrying her, robed in ceremonial kimono, to be put under the patronage of the family's household god; then her first dolls festival, when her parents gave her a set of dolls and their miniature belongings, to be added to as year succeeded year; and perhaps the most important occasion of all, on her third birthday, when her first OBI (broad brocade sash) of scarlet and gold was tied round her small waist, a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind", ' Now that she was seven years of age, and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents, their cup of happiness seemed full  There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family  One day there was much excitement in the home, for the father had been suddenly summoned to the capital on business  In these days of railways and jinrickshas and other rapid modes of traveling, it is difficult to realize what such a journey as that from Matsuyama to Kyoto meant  The roads were rough and bad, and ordinary people had to walk every step of the way, whether the distance were one hundred or several hundred miles  Indeed, in those days it was as great an undertaking to go up to the capital as it is for a Japanese to make a voyage to Europe now  So the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey, knowing what an arduous task lay before him', " Vainly she wished that she could accompany him, but the distance was too great for the mother and child to go, and besides that, it was the wife's duty to take care of the home", ' All was ready at last, and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him  "Do not be anxious, I will come back soon," said the man  "While I am away take care of everything, and especially of our little daughter " "Yes, we shall be all right--but you--you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in coming back to us," said the wife, while the tears fell like rain from her eyes  The little girl was the only one to smile, for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting, and did not know that going to the capital was at all different from walking to the next village, which her father did very often  She ran to his side, and caught hold of his long sleeve to keep him a moment  "Father, I will be very good while I am waiting for you to come back, so please bring me a present " As the father turned to take a last look at his weeping wife and smiling, eager child, he felt as if some one were pulling him back by the hair, so hard was it for him to leave them behind, for they had never been separated before  But he knew that he must go, for the call was imperative  With a great effort he ceased to think, and resolutely turning away he went quickly down the little garden and out through the gate  His wife, catching up the child in her arms, ran as far as the gate, and watched him as he went down the road between the pines till he was lost in the haze of the distance and all she could see was his quaint peaked hat, and at last that vanished too  "Now father has gone, you and I must take care of everything till he comes back," said the mother, as she made her way back to the house  "Yes, I will be very good," said the child, nodding her head, "and when father comes home please tell him how good I have been, and then perhaps he will give me a present " "Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much  I know, for I asked him to bring you a doll  You must think of father every day, and pray for a safe journey till he comes back " "O, yes, when he comes home again how happy I shall be," said the child, clapping her hands, and her face growing bright with joy at the glad thought', " It seemed to the mother as she looked at the child's face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper" ,  ' In a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe  It was made of clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter  In the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through; and, indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence  The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain  There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room  He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value  The rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about  A large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open  She called out to the others, "Let us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth playing at " Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game  It was late at night, but as the moon shone through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate', " And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings", ' "Each has its own value," said the wagon; "we cannot all be noblemen; there must be some to do the work " The money-pig was the only one who received a written invitation  He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message  But in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were to arrange for him to do so; and so they did  The little toy theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into it  Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first  The rocking-horse spoke of training and races; the wagon of railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should talk of them  The clock talked politics--"tick, tick;" he professed to know what was the time of day, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly  The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid  When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw  But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not yet married  "I crack for everybody," said the cracker  "Yes, and a fine noise you make," thought the audience, as the play went on  It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they were made only to be seen on one side  The acting was wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because the wires were a little too long  The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much  So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen  They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play  Children must often have wondered why jelly-fishes have no shells, like so many of the creatures that are washed up every day on the beach  In old times this was not so; the jelly-fish had as hard a shell as any of them, but he lost it through his own fault, as may be seen in this story  The sea-queen Otohime, whom you read of in the story of Uraschimatoro, grew suddenly very ill  The swiftest messengers were sent hurrying to fetch the best doctors from every country under the sea, but it was all of no use; the queen grew rapidly worse instead of better  Everyone had almost given up hope, when one day a doctor arrived who was cleverer than the rest, and said that the only thing that would cure her was the liver of an ape  Now apes do not dwell under the sea, so a council of the wisest heads in the nation was called to consider the question how a liver could be obtained  At length it was decided that the turtle, whose prudence was well known, should swim to land and contrive to catch a living ape and bring him safely to the ocean kingdom  It was easy enough for the council to entrust this mission to the turtle, but not at all so easy for him to fulfil it  However he swam to a part of the coast that was covered with tall trees, where he thought the apes were likely to be; for he was old, and had seen many things  It was some time before he caught sight of any monkeys, and he often grew tired with watching for them, so that one hot day he fell fast asleep, in spite of all his efforts to keep awake', " By-and-by some apes, who had been peeping at him from the tops of the trees, where they had been carefully hidden from the turtle's eyes, stole noiselessly down, and stood round staring at him, for they had never seen a turtle before, and did not know what to make of it", ' At last one young monkey, bolder than the rest, stooped down and stroked the shining shell that the strange new creature wore on its back  The movement, gentle though it was, woke the turtle', " With one sweep he seized the monkey's hand in his mouth, and held it tight, in spite of every effort to pull it away", ' The other apes, seeing that the turtle was not to be trifled with, ran off, leaving their young brother to his fate', " Then the turtle said to the monkey, 'If you will be quiet, and do what I tell you, I won't hurt you", ' But you must get on my back and come with me', "' The monkey, seeing there was no help for it, did as he was bid; indeed he could not have resisted, as his hand was still in the turtle's mouth", ' Delighted at having secured his prize, the turtle hastened back to the shore and plunged quickly into the water  He swam faster than he had ever done before, and soon reached the royal palace  Shouts of joy broke forth from the attendants when he was seen approaching, and some of them ran to tell the queen that the monkey was there, and that before long she would be as well as ever she was  In fact, so great was their relief that they gave the monkey such a kind welcome, and were so anxious to make him happy and comfortable, that he soon forgot all the fears that had beset him as to his fate, and was generally quite at his ease, though every now and then a fit of home-sickness would come over him, and he would hide himself in some dark corner till it had passed away  It was during one of these attacks of sadness that a jelly-fish happened to swim by  At that time jelly-fishes had shells', " At the sight of the gay and lively monkey crouching under a tall rock, with his eyes closed and his head bent, the jelly-fish was filled with pity, and stopped, saying, 'Ah, poor fellow, no wonder you weep; a few days more, and they will come and kill you and give your liver to the queen to eat", "' The monkey shrank back horrified at these words and asked the jelly-fish what crime he had committed that deserved death", " 'Oh, none at all,' replied the jelly-fish, 'but your liver is the only thing that will cure our queen, and how can we get at it without killing you? You had better submit to your fate, and make no noise about it, for though I pity you from my heart there is no way of helping you", "' Then he went away, leaving the ape cold with horror", ' At first he felt as if his liver was already being taken from his body, but soon he began to wonder if there was no means of escaping this terrible death, and at length he invented a plan which he thought would do  For a few days he pretended to be gay and happy as before, but when the sun went in, and rain fell in torrents, he wept and howled from dawn to dark, till the turtle, who was his head keeper, heard him, and came to see what was the matter Along time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet  As he was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose without, and the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old poet sat warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the roasting apple hissed  "Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin," said the good old poet  "Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I\'m so wet!" exclaimed suddenly a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance, while the rain poured down, and the wind made all the windows rattle  "Poor thing!" said the old poet, as he went to open the door  There stood a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long golden hair; he trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm room he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest  "Poor child!" said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand  "Come in, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and roasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!" And the boy was so really  His eyes were like two bright stars; and although the water trickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls  He looked exactly like a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled with cold  He had a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite spoiled by the rain, and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one into the other  The old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little fellow on his lap; he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair, warmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine  Then the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from the lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet  "You are a merry fellow," said the old man  "What\'s your name?" "My name is Cupid," answered the boy  "Don\'t you know me? There lies my bow; it shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing up, and the moon is shining clear again through the window " "Why, your bow is quite spoiled," said the old poet  "That were sad indeed," said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand and examined it on every side  "Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt at all; the string is quite tight  I will try it directly " And he bent his bow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart  "You see now that my bow was not spoiled," said he laughing; and away he ran  The naughty boy, to shoot the old poet in that way; he who had taken him into his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had given him warm wine and the very best apples! The poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really flown into his heart  "Fie!" said he  "How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children about him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will only cause them sorrow and many a heartache " And all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed of this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is astonishingly cunning  When the university students come from the lectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under his arm  It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk along with him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like themselves; and then, unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom  When the young maidens come from being examined by the clergyman, or go to church to be confirmed, there he is again close behind them  Yes, he is forever following people  One would have thought that something important was going on in the duck-pond, but it was nothing after all  All the ducks lying quietly on the water or standing on their heads in it--for they could do that--at once swarm to the sides; the traces of their feet were seen in the wet earth, and their cackling was heard far and wide  The water, which a few moments before had been as clear and smooth as a mirror, became very troubled', " Before, every tree, every neighbouring bush, the old farmhouse with the holes in the roof and the swallows' nest, and especially the great rose-bush full of flowers, had been reflected in it", ' The rose-bush covered the wall and hung out over the water, in which everything was seen as if in a picture, except that it all stood on its head; but when the water was troubled everything got mixed up, and the picture was gone  Two feathers which the fluttering ducks had lost floated up and down; suddenly they took a rush as if the wind were coming, but as it did not come they had to lie still, and the water once more became quiet and smooth  The roses were again reflected; they were very beautiful, but they did not know it, for no one had told them  The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness  "How beautiful existence is!" said each rose  "The only thing that I wish for is to be able to kiss the sun, because it is so warm and bright  I should also like to kiss those roses down in the water, which are so much like us, and the pretty little birds down in the nest  There are some up above too; they put out their heads and pipe softly; they have no feathers like their father and mother  We have good neighbours, both below and above  How beautiful existence is!" The young ones above and below--those below were really only shadows in the water--were sparrows; their parents were sparrows too, and had taken possession of the empty swallows\' nest of last year, and now lived in it as if it were their own property  "Are those the duck\'s children swimming here?" asked the young sparrows when they saw the feathers on the water  "If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones," said their mother  "Don\'t you see that they are feathers, such as I wear and you will wear too? But ours are finer  Still, I should like to have them up in the nest, for they keep one warm', " I am very curious to know what the ducks were so startled about; not about us, certainly, although I did say 'peep' to you pretty loudly", ' The thick-headed roses ought to know why, but they know nothing at all; they only look at themselves and smell  I am heartily tired of such neighbours " "Listen to the dear little birds up there," said the roses; "they begin to want to sing too, but are not able to manage it yet  But it will soon come  What a pleasure that must be! It is fine to have such cheerful neighbours " Suddenly two horses came galloping up to be watered  A peasant boy rode on one, and he had taken off all his clothes except his large broad black hat  The boy whistled like a bird, and rode into the pond where it was deepest, and as he passed the rose-bush he plucked a rose and stuck it in his hat  Now he looked dressed, and rode on  The other roses looked after their sister, and asked each other, "Where can she be going to?" But none of them knew  "I should like to go out into the world for once," said one; "but here at home among our green leaves it is beautiful too  ONCE upon a time there lived at Quesnoy, in Flanders, a great lord whose name was Burchard, but whom the country people called Burchard the Wolf  Now Burchard had such a wicked, cruel heart, that it was whispered how he used to harness his peasants to the plough, and force them by blows from his whip to till his land with naked feet  His wife, on the other hand, was always tender and pitiful to the poor and miserable', " Every time that she heard of another misdeed of her husband's she secretly went to repair the evil, which caused her name to be blessed throughout the whole country-side", ' This Countess was adored as much as the Count was hated  One day when he was out hunting the Count passed through a forest, and at the door of a lonely cottage he saw a beautiful girl spinning hemp', " 'What is your name?' he asked her", " 'Renelde, my lord", "' 'You must get tired of staying in such a lonely place?' 'I am accustomed to it, my lord, and I never get tired of it", "' 'That may be so; but come to the castle, and I will make you lady's maid to the Countess", "' 'I cannot do that, my lord", ' I have to look after my grandmother, who is very helpless', "' 'Come to the castle, I tell you", " I shall expect you this evening,' and he went on his way", ' But Renelde, who was betrothed to a young wood-cutter called Guilbert, had no intention of obeying the Count, and she had, besides, to take care of her grandmother  Three days later the Count again passed by', " 'Why didn't you come?' he asked the pretty spinner", " 'I told you, my lord, that I have to look after my grandmother", "' 'Come to-morrow, and I will make you lady-in-waiting to the Countess,' and he went on his way", ' This offer produced no more effect than the other, and Renelde did not go to the castle', " 'If you will only come,' said the Count to her when next he rode by, 'I will send away the Countess, and will marry you", "' But two years before, when Renelde's mother was dying of a long illness, the Countess had not forgotten them, but had given help when they sorely needed it", ' So even if the Count had really wished to marry Renelde, she would always have refused  Some weeks passed before Burchard appeared again  Renelde hoped she had got rid of him, when one day he stopped at the door, his duck-gun under his arm and his game-bag on his shoulder  This time Renelde was spinning not hemp, but flax', " 'What are you spinning?' he asked in a rough voice", " 'My wedding shift, my lord", "' 'You are going to be married, then?' 'Yes, my lord, by your leave", "' For at that time no peasant could marry without the leave of his master" ,  ' In China, as I daresay you know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all his courtiers are also Chinamen  The story I am going to tell you happened many years ago, but it is worth while for you to listen to it, before it is forgotten', " The Emperor's Palace was the most splendid in the world, all made of priceless porcelain, but so brittle and delicate that you had to take great care how you touched it", ' In the garden were the most beautiful flowers, and on the loveliest of them were tied silver bells which tinkled, so that if you passed you could not help looking at the flowers', " Everything in the Emperor's garden was admirably arranged with a view to effect; and the garden was so large that even the gardener himself did not know where it ended", ' If you ever got beyond it, you came to a stately forest with great trees and deep lakes in it  The forest sloped down to the sea, which was a clear blue  Large ships could sail under the boughs of the trees, and in these trees there lived a Nightingale  She sang so beautifully that even the poor fisherman who had so much to do stood and listened when he came at night to cast his nets', " 'How beautiful it is!' he said; but he had to attend to his work, and forgot about the bird", " But when she sang the next night and the fisherman came there again, he said the same thing, 'How beautiful it is!' From all the countries round came travellers to the Emperor's town, who were astonished at the Palace and the garden", " But when they heard the Nightingale they all said, 'This is the finest thing after all!' The travellers told all about it when they went home, and learned scholars wrote many books upon the town, the Palace, and the garden", ' But they did not forget the Nightingale; she was praised the most, and all the poets composed splendid verses on the Nightingale in the forest by the deep sea  The books were circulated throughout the world, and some of them reached the Emperor  He sat in his golden chair, and read and read  He nodded his head every moment, for he liked reading the brilliant accounts of the town, the Palace, and the garden', " 'But the Nightingale is better than all,' he saw written", " 'What is that?' said the Emperor", " 'I don't know anything about the Nightingale! Is there such a bird in my empire, and so near as in my garden? I have never heard it! Fancy reading for the first time about it in a book!' And he called his First Lord to him", " He was so proud that if anyone of lower rank than his own ventured to speak to him or ask him anything, he would say nothing but 'P!' and that does not mean anything", " 'Here is a most remarkable bird which is called a Nightingale!' said the Emperor", " 'They say it is the most glorious thing in my kingdom", " Why has no one ever said anything to me about it?' 'I have never before heard it mentioned!' said the First Lord", " 'I will look for it and find it!' But where was it to be found? The First Lord ran up and down stairs, through the halls and corridors; but none of those he met had ever heard of the Nightingale", ' And the First Lord ran again to the Emperor, and told him that it must be an invention on the part of those who had written the books', " 'Your Imperial Majesty cannot really believe all that is written! There are some inventions called the Black Art!' 'But the book in which I read this,' said the Emperor, 'is sent me by His Great Majesty the Emperor of Japan; so it cannot be untrue, and I will hear the Nightingale! She must be here this evening! She has my gracious permission to appear, and if she does not, the whole Court shall be trampled under foot after supper!' 'Tsing pe!' said the First Lord; and he ran up and down stairs, through the halls and corridors, and half the Court ran with him, for they did not want to be trampled under foot", ' Everyone was asking after the wonderful Nightingale which all the world knew of, except those at Court', " At last they met a poor little girl in the kitchen, who said, 'Oh! I know the Nightingale well", " How she sings! I have permission to carry the scraps over from the Court meals to my poor sick mother, and when I am going home at night, tired and weary, and rest for a little in the wood, then I hear the Nightingale singing! It brings tears to my eyes, and I feel as if my mother were kissing me!' 'Little kitchenmaid!' said the First Lord, 'I will give you a place in the kitchen, and you shall have leave to see the Emperor at dinner, if you can lead us to the Nightingale, for she is invited to come to Court this evening", "' And so they all went into the wood where the Nightingale was wont to sing, and half the Court went too" ,  ' "SHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses," cried the young Student; "but in all my garden there is no red rose " From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered  "No red rose in all my garden!" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears  "Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched " "Here at last is a true lover," said the Nightingale  "Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him  His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow " "The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night," murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company  If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by  She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break " "Here indeed is the true lover," said the Nightingale  "What I sing of, he sufferswhat is joy to me, to him is pain  Surely Love is a wonderful thing  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals  Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold " "The musicians will sit in their gallery," said the young Student, "and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin  She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her"; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept  "Why is he weeping?" asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air  "Why, indeed?" said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam  "Why, indeed?" whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice  "He is weeping for a red rose," said the Nightingale  "For a red rose?" they cried; "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright', " But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love", ' Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air  She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden  In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray  Once upon a time there stood before the palace of an emperor a golden apple tree, which blossomed and bore fruit each night  But every morning the fruit was gone, and the boughs were bare of blossom, without anyone being able to discover who was the thief', " At last the emperor said to his eldest son, 'If only I could prevent those robbers from stealing my fruit, how happy I should be!' And his son replied, 'I will sit up to-night and watch the tree, and I shall soon see who it is!' So directly it grew dark the young man went and hid himself near the apple tree to begin his watch, but the apples had scarcely begun to ripen before he fell asleep, and when he awoke at sunrise the apples were gone", ' He felt very much ashamed of himself, and went with lagging feet to tell his father! Of course, though the eldest son had failed, the second made sure that he would do better, and set out gaily at nightfall to watch the apple tree  But no sooner had he lain himself down than his eyes grew heavy, and when the sunbeams roused him from his slumbers there was not an apple left on the tree  Next came the turn of the youngest son, who made himself a comfortable bed under the apple tree, and prepared himself to sleep  Towards midnight he awoke, and sat up to look at the tree  And behold! the apples were beginning to ripen, and lit up the whole palace with their brightness', " At the same moment nine golden pea-hens flew swiftly through the air, and while eight alighted upon the boughs laden with fruit, the ninth fluttered to the ground where the prince lay, and instantly was changed into a beautiful maiden, more beautiful far than any lady in the emperor's court", ' The prince at once fell in love with her, and they talked together for some time, till the maiden said her sisters had finished plucking the apples, and now they must all go home again  The prince, however, begged her so hard to leave him a little of the fruit that the maiden gave him two apples, one for himself and one for his father  Then she changed herself back into a pea-hen, and the whole nine flew away  As soon as the sun rose the prince entered the palace, and held out the apple to his father, who was rejoiced to see it, and praised his youngest son heartily for his cleverness  That evening the prince returned to the apple tree, and everything passed as before, and so it happened for several nights  At length the other brothers grew angry at seeing that he never came back without bringing two golden apples with him, and they went to consult an old witch, who promised to spy after him, and discover how he managed to get the apples  So, when the evening came, the old woman hid herself under the tree and waited for the prince  Before long he arrived and laid down on his bed, and was soon fast asleep  Towards midnight there was a rush of wings, and the eight pea-hens settled on the tree, while the ninth became a maiden, and ran to greet the prince', " Then the witch stretched out her hand, and cut off a lock of the maiden's hair, and in an instant the girl sprang up, a pea-hen once more, spread her wings and flew away, while her sisters, who were busily stripping the boughs, flew after her", " When he had recovered from his surprise at the unexpected disappearance of the maiden, the prince exclaimed, 'What can be the matter?' and, looking about him, discovered the old witch hidden under the bed", ' He dragged her out, and in his fury called his guards, and ordered them to put her to death as fast as possible  But that did no good as far as the pea-hens went  They never came back any more, though the prince returned to the tree every night, and wept his heart out for his lost love  This went on for some time, till the prince could bear it no longer, and made up his mind he would search the world through for her  In vain his father tried to persuade him that his task was hopeless, and that other girls were to be found as beautiful as this one  The prince would listen to nothing, and, accompanied by only one servant, set out on his quest  After travelling for many days, he arrived at length before a large gate, and through the bars he could see the streets of a town, and even the palace  The prince tried to pass in, but the way was barred by the keeper of the gate, who wanted to know who he was, why he was there, and how he had learnt the way, and he was not allowed to enter unless the empress herself came and gave him leave  A message was sent to her, and when she stood at the gate the prince thought he had lost his wits, for there was the maiden he had left his home to seek  And she hastened to him, and took his hand, and drew him into the palace' ,  "  My father and mother were Irish   And I am Irish too;  I bought a wee fidil for ninepence   And that is Irish too;  I'm up in the morning early   To meet the break of day,  And to the lintwhite's piping   The many's the tunes I play!  One pleasant eve in June-time   I met a lochrie man,  His face and hands were weazen,   His height was not a span", '  He boor\'d me for my fidil--   "You know," says he, "like you,  "My father and mother were Irish,   "And I am Irish too!"  He took my wee red fidil,   And such a tune he turned,  The Glaise in it whispered   The Lionan in it m\'urned;  Says he, "My lad, you\'re lucky,   "I wisht I was like you,  "You\'re lucky in your birth-star,   "And in your fidil too!"  He gave me back my fidil,   My fidil-stick also,  And stepping like a May-boy,   He jumped the Lear-gaidh-knowe   I never saw him after,   Nor met his gentle kind,  But whiles I think I hear him,   A-wheening in the wind!    There was once upon a time a miller who was very well off, and had as much money and as many goods as he knew what to do with  But sorrow comes in the night, and the miller all of a sudden became so poor that at last he could hardly call the mill in which he sat his own  He wandered about all day full of despair and misery, and when he lay down at night he could get no rest, but lay awake all night sunk in sorrowful thoughts  One morning he rose up before dawn and went outside, for he thought his heart would be lighter in the open air  As he wandered up and down on the banks of the mill-pond he heard a rustling in the water, and when he looked near he saw a white woman rising up from the waves', " He realised at once that this could be none other than the nixy of the mill-pond, and in his terror he didn't know if he should fly away or remain where he was", ' While he hesitated the nixy spoke, called him by his name, and asked him why he was so sad', " When the miller heard how friendly her tone was, he plucked up heart and told her how rich and prosperous he had been all his life up till now, when he didn't know what he was to do for want and misery", ' Then the nixy spoke comforting words to him, and promised that she would make him richer and more prosperous than he had ever been in his life before, if he would give her in return the youngest thing in his house  The miller thought she must mean one of his puppies or kittens, so promised the nixy at once what she asked, and returned to his mill full of hope  On the threshold he was greeted by a servant with the news that his wife had just given birth to a boy  The poor miller was much horrified by these tidings, and went in to his wife with a heavy heart to tell her and his relations of the fatal bargain he had just struck with the nixy', " 'I would gladly give up all the good fortune she promised me,' he said, 'if I could only save my child", "' But no one could think of any advice to give him, beyond taking care that the child never went near the mill-pond", ' So the boy throve and grew big, and in the meantime all prospered with the miller, and in a few years he was richer than he had ever been before  But all the same he did not enjoy his good fortune, for he could not forget his compact with the nixy, and he knew that sooner or later she would demand his fulfilment of it  But year after year went by, and the boy grew up and became a great hunter, and the lord of the land took him into his service, for he was as smart and bold a hunter as you would wish to see  In a short time he married a pretty young wife, and lived with her in great peace and happiness  One day when he was out hunting a hare sprang up at his feet, and ran for some way in front of him in the open field  The hunter pursued it hotly for some time, and at last shot it dead  Then he proceeded to skin it, never noticing that he was close to the mill-pond, which from childhood up he had been taught to avoid  He soon finished the skinning, and went to the water to wash the blood off his hands  He had hardly dipped them in the pond when the nixy rose up in the water, and seizing him in her wet arms she dragged him down with her under the waves  When the hunter did not come home in the evening his wife grew very anxious, and when his game bag was found close to the mill-pond she guessed at once what had befallen him  She was nearly beside herself with grief, and roamed round and round the pond calling on her husband without ceasing  At last, worn out with sorrow and fatigue, she fell asleep and dreamt that she was wandering along a flowery meadow, when she came to a hut where she found an old witch, who promised to restore her husband to her  When she awoke next morning she determined to set out and find the witch; so she wandered on for many a day, and at last she reached the flowery meadow and found the hut where the old witch lived', " The poor wife told her all that had happened and how she had been told in a dream of the witch's power to help her", ' The witch counselled her to go to the pond the first time there was a full moon, and to comb her black hair with a golden comb, and then to place the comb on the bank', " The hunter's wife gave the witch a handsome present, thanked her heartily, and returned home" ,  ' ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen  They had three sons, two of them with their wits about them, but the third a simpleton  Now the King had a deer park in which were quantities of wild animals of different kinds  Into that park there used to come a huge beast--Norka was its name--and do fearful mischief, devouring some of the animals every night  The King did all he could, but he was unable to destroy it', " So at last he called his sons together and said, 'Whoever will destroy the Norka, to him will I give the half of my kingdom", "' Well, the eldest son undertook the task", ' As soon as it was night, he took his weapons and set out  But before he reached the park, he went into a traktir (or tavern), and there he spent the whole night in revelry  When he came to his senses it was too late; the day had already dawned  He felt himself disgraced in the eyes of his father, but there was no help for it  The next day the second son went, and did just the same  Their father scolded them both soundly, and there was an end of it  Well, on the third day the youngest son undertook the task', " They all laughed him to scorn, because he was so stupid, feeling sure he wouldn't do anything", ' But he took his arms, and went straight into the park, and sat down on the grass in such a position that the moment he went asleep his weapons would prick him, and he would awake  Presently the midnight hour sounded  The earth began to shake, and the Norka came rushing up, and burst right through the fence into the park, so huge was it  The Prince pulled himself together, leapt to his feet, crossed himself, and went straight at the beast  It fled back, and the Prince ran after it', " But he soon saw that he couldn't catch it on foot, so he hastened to the stable, laid his hands on the best horse there, and set off in pursuit", ' Presently he came up with the beast, and they began a fight  They fought and fought; the Prince gave the beast three wounds  At last they were both utterly exhausted, so they lay down to take a short rest  But the moment the Prince closed his eyes, up jumped the beast and took to flight', " The Prince's horse awoke him; up he jumped in a moment, and set off again in pursuit, caught up the beast, and again began fighting with it", ' Again the Prince gave the beast three wounds, and then he and the beast lay down again to rest  Thereupon away fled the beast as before  The Prince caught it up, and again gave it three wounds', " But all of a sudden, just as the Prince began chasing it for the fourth time, the beast fled to a great white stone, tilted it up, and escaped into the other world, crying out to the Prince: 'Then only will you overcome me, when you enter here" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a sultan who loved his garden dearly, and planted it with trees and flowers and fruits from all parts of the world', " He went to see them three times every day: first at seven o'clock, when he got up, then at three, and lastly at half-past five", ' There was no plant and no vegetable which escaped his eye, but he lingered longest of all before his one date tree  Now the sultan had seven sons  Six of them he was proud of, for they were strong and manly, but the youngest he disliked, for he spent all his time among the women of the house  The sultan had talked to him, and he paid no heed; and he had beaten him, and he paid no heed; and he had tied him up, and he paid no heed, till at last his father grew tired of trying to make him change his ways, and let him alone  Time passed, and one day the sultan, to his great joy, saw signs of fruit on his date tree', " And he told his vizir, 'My date tree is bearing;' and he told the officers, 'My date tree is bearing;' and he told the judges, 'My date tree is bearing;' and he told all the rich men of the town", " He waited patiently for some days till the dates were nearly ripe, and then he called his six sons, and said: 'One of you must watch the date tree till the dates are ripe, for if it is not watched the slaves will steal them, and I shall not have any for another year", "' And the eldest son answered, 'I will go, father,' and he went", ' The first thing the youth did was to summon his slaves, and bid them beat drums all night under the date tree, for he feared to fall asleep', " So the slaves beat the drums, and the young man danced till four o'clock, and then it grew so cold he could dance no longer, and one of the slaves said to him: 'It is getting light; the tree is safe; lie down, master, and go to sleep", "' So he lay down and slept, and his slaves slept likewise", ' A few minutes went by, and a bird flew down from a neighbouring thicket, and ate all the dates, without leaving a single one  And when the tree was stripped bare, the bird went as it had come  Soon after, one of the slaves woke up and looked for the dates, but there were no dates to see', " Then he ran to the young man and shook him, saying: 'Your father set you to watch the tree, and you have not watched, and the dates have all been eaten by a bird", "' The lad jumped up and ran to the tree to see for himself, but there was not a date anywhere", ' And he cried aloud, \'What am I to say to my father? Shall I tell him that the dates have been stolen, or that a great rain fell and a great storm blew? But he will send me to gather them up and bring them to him, and there are none to bring! Shall I tell him that Bedouins drove me away, and when I returned there were no dates? And he will answer, "You had slaves, did they not fight with the Bedouins?" It is the truth that will be best, and that will I tell him', "' Then he went straight to his father, and found him sitting in his verandah with his five sons round him; and the lad bowed his head", " 'Give me the news from the garden,' said the sultan", " And the youth answered, 'The dates have all been eaten by some bird: there is not one left", "' The sultan was silent for a moment: then he asked, 'Where were you when the bird came?' The lad answered: 'I watched the date tree till the cocks were crowing and it was getting light; then I lay down for a little, and I slept", ' When I woke a slave was standing over me, and he said, "There is not one date left on the tree!" And I went to the date tree, and saw it was true; and that is what I have to tell you', "' And the sultan replied, 'A son like you is only good for eating and sleeping", ' I have no use for you  Go your way, and when my date tree bears again, I will send another son; perhaps he will watch better', "' So he waited many months, till the tree was covered with more dates than any tree had ever borne before", " When they were near ripening he sent one of his sons to the garden: saying, 'My son, I am longing to taste those dates: go and watch over them, for to-day's sun will bring them to perfection", "' And the lad answered: 'My father, I am going now, and to-morrow, when the sun has passed the hour of seven, bid a slave come and gather the dates" ,  ' There is a street in Copenhagen with a very strange name  It is called "Hysken" street  Where the name came from, and what it means is very uncertain  It is said to be German, but that is unjust to the Germans, for it would then be called "Hauschen," not "Hysken " "Hauschen," means a little house; and for many years it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time  They were perhaps a little higher, and had windows; but the panes consisted of horn or bladder-skins, for glass was then too dear to have glazed windows in every house  This was a long time ago, so long indeed that our grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers, would speak of those days as "olden times;" indeed, many centuries have passed since then  The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck, who carried on trade in Copenhagen, did not reside in the town themselves, but sent their clerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths in the Hauschen street, and sold beer and spices  The German beer was very good, and there were many sorts--from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick--and quantities of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially pepper; indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold here; so it happened at last that the German clerks in Denmark got their nickname of "pepper gentry " It had been made a condition with these clerks that they should not marry; so that those who lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had any to light  Many of them were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange thoughts and eccentric habits  From this, all unmarried men, who have attained a certain age, are called, in Denmark, "pepper gentry;" and this must be remembered by all those who wish to understand the story  These "pepper gentlemen," or, as they are called in England, "old bachelors," are often made a butt of ridicule; they are told to put on their nightcaps, draw them over their eyes, and go to sleep  The boys in Denmark make a song of it, thus:--  "Poor old bachelor, cut your wood,   Such a nightcap was never seen;   Who would think it was ever clean?  Go to sleep, it will do you good " So they sing about the "pepper gentleman;" so do they make sport of the poor old bachelor and his nightcap, and all because they really know nothing of either  It is a cap that no one need wish for, or laugh at  And why not? Well, we shall hear in the story  In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite  At these times the odor of the pepper, saffron, and ginger became more powerful than ever  Behind the counter, as a rule, there were no young men  The clerks were almost all old boys; but they did not dress as we are accustomed to see old men represented, wearing wigs, nightcaps, and knee-breeches, and with coat and waistcoat buttoned up to the chin  We have seen the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in this way; but the "pepper gentlemen" had no money to spare to have their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays  On these occasions, they wore high-crowned, broad-brimmed hats, and sometimes a younger clerk would stick a feather in his  The woollen shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar; the close jacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely over it; the trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for the clerks wore no stockings  They generally stuck a table-knife and spoon in their girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection to themselves; and such a weapon was often very necessary  After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays and festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore a kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, to which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he had two, nightcaps I mean, not heads  Anthony was one of the oldest of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter  He was as thin as a lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers, bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft of hair, which did not look handsome, but made his appearance very remarkable  People knew that he came from Bremen; it was not exactly his home, although his master resided there  His ancestors were from Thuringia, and had lived in the town of Eisenach, close by Wartburg  In the country of Wurtemburg, in Germany, where the acacias grow by the public road, where the apple-trees and the pear-trees in autumn bend to the earth with the weight of the precious fruit, lies the little town of Marbach', " As is often the case with many of these towns, it is charmingly situated on the banks of the river Neckar, which rushes rapidly by, passing villages, old knights' castles, and green vineyards, till its waters mingle with those of the stately Rhine", ' It was late in the autumn; the vine-leaves still hung upon the branches of the vines, but they were already tinted with red and gold; heavy showers fell on the surrounding country, and the cold autumn wind blew sharp and strong  It was not at all pleasant weather for the poor  The days grew shorter and more gloomy, and, dark as it was out of doors in the open air, it was still darker within the small, old-fashioned houses of the village  The gable end of one of these houses faced the street, and with its small, narrow windows, presented a very mean appearance  The family who dwelt in it were also very poor and humble, but they treasured the fear of God in their innermost hearts  And now He was about to send them a child', " It was the hour of the mother's sorrow, when there pealed forth from the church tower the sound of festive bells", " In that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime", ' The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark November day  Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, "On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son " And a short time after, when the child had been baptized, the names he had received were added, "John Christopher Frederick " And what became of the little lad?--the poor boy of the humble town of Marbach? Ah, indeed, there was no one who thought or supposed, not even the old church bell which had been the first to sound and chime for him, that he would be the first to sing the beautiful song of "The Bell " The boy grew apace, and the world advanced with him  While he was yet a child, his parents removed from Marbach, and went to reside in another town; but their dearest friends remained behind at Marbach, and therefore sometimes the mother and her son would start on a fine day to pay a visit to the little town  The boy was at this time about six years old, and already knew a great many stories out of the Bible, and several religious psalms  While seated in the evening on his little cane-chair, he had often heard his father read from Gellert\'s fables, and sometimes from Klopstock\'s grand poem, "The Messiah " He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all  On his first visit to Marbach, the town appeared to have changed but very little, and it was not far enough away to be forgotten  The house, with its pointed gable, narrow windows, overhanging walls and stories, projecting one beyond another, looked just the same as in former times  But in the churchyard there were several new graves; and there also, in the grass, close by the wall, stood the old church bell! It had been taken down from its high position, in consequence of a crack in the metal which prevented it from ever chiming again, and a new bell now occupied its place  The mother and son were walking in the churchyard when they discovered the old bell, and they stood still to look at it  Then the mother reminded her little boy of what a useful bell this had been for many hundred years  It had chimed for weddings and for christenings; it had tolled for funerals, and to give the alarm in case of fire  With every event in the life of man the bell had made its voice heard  His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her  And the boy gazed on the large, old bell with the deepest interest  He bowed his head over it and kissed it, old, thrown away, and cracked as it was, and standing there amidst the grass and nettles  The boy never forgot what his mother told him, and the tones of the old bell reverberated in his heart till he reached manhood  In a house, with a large courtyard, in a provincial town, at that time of the year in which people say the evenings are growing longer, a family circle were gathered together at their old home  A lamp burned on the table, although the weather was mild and warm, and the long curtains hung down before the open windows, and without the moon shone brightly in the dark-blue sky  But they were not talking of the moon, but of a large, old stone that lay below in the courtyard not very far from the kitchen door  The maids often laid the clean copper saucepans and kitchen vessels on this stone, that they might dry in the sun, and the children were fond of playing on it  It was, in fact, an old grave-stone  "Yes," said the master of the house, "I believe the stone came from the graveyard of the old church of the convent which was pulled down, and the pulpit, the monuments, and the grave-stones sold  My father bought the latter; most of them were cut in two and used for paving-stones, but that one stone was preserved whole, and laid in the courtyard " "Any one can see that it is a grave-stone," said the eldest of the children; "the representation of an hour-glass and part of the figure of an angel can still be traced, but the inscription beneath is quite worn out, excepting the name \'Preben,\' and a large \'S\' close by it, and a little farther down the name of \'Martha\' can be easily read  But nothing more, and even that cannot be seen unless it has been raining, or when we have washed the stone " "Dear me! how singular  Why that must be the grave-stone of Preben Schwane and his wife " The old man who said this looked old enough to be the grandfather of all present in the room  "Yes," he continued, "these people were among the last who were buried in the churchyard of the old convent  They were a very worthy old couple, I can remember them well in the days of my boyhood  Every one knew them, and they were esteemed by all  They were the oldest residents in the town, and people said they possessed a ton of gold, yet they were always very plainly dressed, in the coarsest stuff, but with linen of the purest whiteness  Preben and Martha were a fine old couple, and when they both sat on the bench, at the top of the steep stone steps, in front of their house, with the branches of the linden-tree waving above them, and nodded in a gentle, friendly way to passers by, it really made one feel quite happy  They were very good to the poor; they fed them and clothed them, and in their benevolence there was judgment as well as true Christianity  The old woman died first; that day is still quite vividly before my eyes', " I was a little boy, and had accompanied my father to the old man's house", ' Martha had fallen into the sleep of death just as we arrived there  The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child  He spoke to my father, and to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love each other  I was, as I have said, a boy, and only stood by and listened to what the others said; but it filled me with a strange emotion to listen to the old man, and to watch how the color rose in his cheeks as he spoke of the days of their courtship, of how beautiful she was, and how many little tricks he had been guilty of, that he might meet her  And then he talked of his wedding-day; and his eyes brightened, and he seemed to be carried back, by his words, to that joyful time  And yet there she was, lying in the next room, dead--an old woman, and he was an old man, speaking of the days of hope, long passed away  Ah, well, so it is; then I was but a child, and now I am old, as old as Preben Schwane then was  Time passes away, and all things changed  I can remember quite well the day on which she was buried, and how Old Preben walked close behind the coffin  "A few years before this time the old couple had had their grave-stone prepared, with an inscription and their names, but not the date  In the street, up there, was an old, a very old house--it was almost three hundred years old, for that might be known by reading the great beam on which the date of the year was carved: together with tulips and hop-binds there were whole verses spelled as in former times, and over every window was a distorted face cut out in the beam', " The one story stood forward a great way over the other; and directly under the eaves was a leaden spout with a dragon's head; the rain-water should have run out of the mouth, but it ran out of the belly, for there was a hole in the spout", ' All the other houses in the street were so new and so neat, with large window panes and smooth walls, one could easily see that they would have nothing to do with the old house: they certainly thought, "How long is that old decayed thing to stand here as a spectacle in the street? And then the projecting windows stand so far out, that no one can see from our windows what happens in that direction! The steps are as broad as those of a palace, and as high as to a church tower  The iron railings look just like the door to an old family vault, and then they have brass tops--that\'s so stupid!" On the other side of the street were also new and neat houses, and they thought just as the others did; but at the window opposite the old house there sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright beaming eyes: he certainly liked the old house best, and that both in sunshine and moonshine  And when he looked across at the wall where the mortar had fallen out, he could sit and find out there the strangest figures imaginable; exactly as the street had appeared before, with steps, projecting windows, and pointed gables; he could see soldiers with halberds, and spouts where the water ran, like dragons and serpents  That was a house to look at; and there lived an old man, who wore plush breeches; and he had a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig that one could see was a real wig  Every morning there came an old fellow to him who put his rooms in order, and went on errands; otherwise, the old man in the plush breeches was quite alone in the old house  Now and then he came to the window and looked out, and the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded again, and so they became acquaintances, and then they were friends, although they had never spoken to each other--but that made no difference  The little boy heard his parents say, "The old man opposite is very well off, but he is so very, very lonely!" The Sunday following, the little boy took something, and wrapped it up in a piece of paper, went downstairs, and stood in the doorway; and when the man who went on errands came past, he said to him-- "I say, master! will you give this to the old man over the way from me? I have two pewter soldiers--this is one of them, and he shall have it, for I know he is so very, very lonely " And the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the pewter soldier over to the old house  Afterwards there came a message; it was to ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a visit; and so he got permission of his parents, and then went over to the old house  And the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever; one would have thought they were polished on account of the visit; and it was as if the carved-out trumpeters--for there were trumpeters, who stood in tulips, carved out on the door--blew with all their might, their cheeks appeared so much rounder than before  Yes, they blew--"Trateratra! The little boy comes! Trateratra!"--and then the door opened  The whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and ladies in silken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns rustled! And then there was a flight of stairs which went a good way upwards, and a little way downwards, and then one came on a balcony which was in a very dilapidated state, sure enough, with large holes and long crevices, but grass grew there and leaves out of them altogether, for the whole balcony outside, the yard, and the walls, were overgrown with so much green stuff, that it looked like a garden; only a balcony', " Here stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears, and the flowers grew just as they liked", ' One of the pots was quite overrun on all sides with pinks, that is to say, with the green part; shoot stood by shoot, and it said quite distinctly, "The air has cherished me, the sun has kissed me, and promised me a little flower on Sunday! a little flower on Sunday!" And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog\'s leather, and printed with gold flowers   "The gilding decays,  But hog\'s leather stays!" said the walls  And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out, and with arms on both sides  "Sit down! sit down!" said they  "Ugh! how I creak; now I shall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress, ugh!" And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows were, and where the old man sat  "I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!" said the old man  "And I thank you because you come over to me " "Thankee! thankee!" or "cranky! cranky!" sounded from all the furniture; there was so much of it, that each article stood in the other\'s way, to get a look at the little boy  In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady, so young, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes that stood quite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said "thankee, thankee!" nor "cranky, cranky!" but looked with her mild eyes at the little boy, who directly asked the old man, "Where did you get her?" "Yonder, at the broker\'s," said the old man, "where there are so many pictures hanging  No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of them buried; but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead and gone these fifty years!" Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of withered flowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old! The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned, and everything in the room became still older; but they did not observe it  "They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are so very, very lonely!" "Oh!" said he  "The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come and visit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!" Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there were whole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters, which one never sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens with waving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of shears held by two lions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that had two heads, for the shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it is a pair! Yes, that was a picture book! The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, and nuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house  "I cannot bear it any longer!" said the pewter soldier, who sat on the drawers  "It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in a family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear it any longer! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home, where your father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your sweet children made such a delightful noise  Nay, how lonely the old man is--do you think that he gets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will get nothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!" "You must not let it grieve you so much," said the little boy  Nothing more happened worth telling for some time  The autumn came and went by  There were no more flowers in the garden  The wind blew strong, and howled among the rocks  The rain fell, and drenched the few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches  Again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring afternoon, and sometimes, for a week together, there would be rain, nothing but rain, all day, and then the most lovely cloudless night, with the sky all out in full-blown stars--not one missing  But the princess could not see much of them, for she went to bed early  The winter drew on, and she found things growing dreary', " When it was too stormy to go out, and she had got tired of her toys, Lootie would take her about the house, sometimes to the housekeeper's room, where the housekeeper, who was a good, kind old woman, made much of her--sometimes to the servants' hall or the kitchen, where she was not princess merely, but absolute queen, and ran a great risk of being spoiled", ' Sometimes she would run off herself to the room where the men-at-arms whom the king had left sat, and they showed her their arms and accoutrements and did what they could to amuse her  Still at times she found it very dreary, and often and often wished that her huge great grandmother had not been a dream  One morning the nurse left her with the housekeeper for a while  To amuse her she turned out the contents of an old cabinet upon the table  The little princess found her treasures, queer ancient ornaments, and many things the use of which she could not imagine, far more interesting than her own toys, and sat playing with them for two hours or more  But, at length, in handling a curious old-fashioned brooch, she ran the pin of it into her thumb, and gave a little scream with the sharpness of the pain, but would have thought little more of it had not the pain increased and her thumb begun to swell  This alarmed the housekeeper greatly  The nurse was fetched; the doctor was sent for; her hand was poulticed, and long before her usual time she was put to bed  The pain still continued, and although she fell asleep and dreamed a good many dreams, there was the pain always in every dream  At last it woke her UP  The moon was shining brightly into the room  The poultice had fallen off her hand and it was burning hot  She fancied if she could hold it into the moonlight that would cool it  So she got out of bed, without waking the nurse who lay at the other end of the room, and went to the window  When she looked out she saw one of the men-at-arms walking in the garden with the moonlight glancing on his armour  She was just going to tap on the window and call him, for she wanted to tell him all about it, when she bethought herself that that might wake Lootie, and she would put her into her bed again  So she resolved to go to the window of another room, and call him from there  It was so much nicer to have somebody to talk to than to lie awake in bed with the burning pain in her hand  She opened the door very gently and went through the nursery, which did not look into the garden, to go to the other window  But when she came to the foot of the old staircase there was the moon shining down from some window high up, and making the worm-eaten oak look very strange and delicate and lovely  In a moment she was putting her little feet one after the other in the silvery path up the stair, looking behind as she went, to see the shadow they made in the middle of the silver  Up the stair then they went, and the next and the next, and through the long rows of empty rooms, and up the little tower stair, Irene growing happier and happier as she ascended  There was no answer when she knocked at length at the door of the workroom, nor could she hear any sound of the spinning-wheel, and once more her heart sank within her, but only for one moment, as she turned and knocked at the other door', " 'Come in,' answered the sweet voice of her grandmother, and Irene opened the door and entered, followed by Curdie", " 'You darling!' cried the lady, who was seated by a fire of red roses mingled with white", " 'I've been waiting for you, and indeed getting a little anxious about you, and beginning to think whether I had not better go and fetch you myself", "' As she spoke she took the little princess in her arms and placed her upon her lap", ' She was dressed in white now, and looking if possible more lovely than ever', " 'I've brought Curdie, grandmother", " He wouldn't believe what I told him and so I've brought him", "' 'Yes--I see him", ' He is a good boy, Curdie, and a brave boy', " Aren't you glad you've got him out?' 'Yes, grandmother", " But it wasn't very good of him not to believe me when I was telling him the truth", "' 'People must believe what they can, and those who believe more must not be hard upon those who believe less", " I doubt if you would have believed it all yourself if you hadn't seen some of it", "' 'Ah! yes, grandmother, I dare say", " I'm sure you are right", " But he'll believe now", "' 'I don't know that,' replied her grandmother", " 'Won't you, Curdie?' said Irene, looking round at him as she asked the question", ' He was standing in the middle of the floor, staring, and looking strangely bewildered  This she thought came of his astonishment at the beauty of the lady', " 'Make a bow to my grandmother, Curdie,' she said", " 'I don't see any grandmother,' answered Curdie rather gruffly", " 'Don't see my grandmother, when I'm sitting in her lap?' exclaimed the princess", " 'No, I don't,' reiterated Curdie, in an offended tone", " 'Don't you see the lovely fire of roses--white ones amongst them this time?' asked Irene, almost as bewildered as he", " 'No, I don't,' answered Curdie, almost sulkily", " 'Nor the blue bed? Nor the rose-coloured counterpane?--Nor the beautiful light, like the moon, hanging from the roof?' 'You're making game of me, Your Royal Highness; and after what we have come through together this day, I don't think it is kind of you,' said Curdie, feeling very much hurt", " 'Then what do you see?' asked Irene, who perceived at once that for her not to believe him was at least as bad as for him not to believe her" ,  ' Did you ever hear the story of the old street lamp? It is not remarkably interesting, but for once in a way you may as well listen to it  It was a most respectable old lamp, which had seen many, many years of service, and now was to retire with a pension  It was this evening at its post for the last time, giving light to the street  His feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theatre, who is dancing for the last time, and knows that on the morrow she will be in her garret, alone and forgotten  The lamp had very great anxiety about the next day, for he knew that he had to appear for the first time at the town hall, to be inspected by the mayor and the council, who were to decide if he were fit for further service or not;--whether the lamp was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country, at some factory; and if not, it would be sent at once to an iron foundry, to be melted down  In this latter case it might be turned into anything, and he wondered very much whether he would then be able to remember that he had once been a street lamp, and it troubled him exceedingly  Whatever might happen, one thing seemed certain, that he would be separated from the watchman and his wife, whose family he looked upon as his own  The lamp had first been hung up on that very evening that the watchman, then a robust young man, had entered upon the duties of his office  Ah, well, it was a very long time since one became a lamp and the other a watchman  His wife had a little pride in those days; she seldom condescended to glance at the lamp, excepting when she passed by in the evening, never in the daytime  But in later years, when all these,--the watchman, the wife, and the lamp--had grown old, she had attended to it, cleaned it, and supplied it with oil  The old people were thoroughly honest, they had never cheated the lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it', " This was the lamp's last night in the street, and to-morrow he must go to the town-hall,--two very dark things to think of", ' No wonder he did not burn brightly  Many other thoughts also passed through his mind  How many persons he had lighted on their way, and how much he had seen; as much, very likely, as the mayor and corporation themselves! None of these thoughts were uttered aloud, however; for he was a good, honorable old lamp, who would not willingly do harm to any one, especially to those in authority  As many things were recalled to his mind, the light would flash up with sudden brightness; he had, at such moments, a conviction that he would be remembered  "There was a handsome young man once," thought he; "it is certainly a long while ago, but I remember he had a little note, written on pink paper with a gold edge; the writing was elegant, evidently a lady\'s hand: twice he read it through, and kissed it, and then looked up at me, with eyes that said quite plainly, \'I am the happiest of men!\' Only he and I know what was written on this his first letter from his lady-love  Ah, yes, and there was another pair of eyes that I remember,--it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another! A funeral passed through the street; a young and beautiful woman lay on a bier, decked with garlands of flowers, and attended by torches, which quite overpowered my light  All along the street stood the people from the houses, in crowds, ready to join the procession  But when the torches had passed from before me, and I could look round, I saw one person alone, standing, leaning against my post, and weeping  Never shall I forget the sorrowful eyes that looked up at me " These and similar reflections occupied the old street lamp, on this the last time that his light would shine', " The sentry, when he is relieved from his post, knows at least who will succeed him, and may whisper a few words to him, but the lamp did not know his successor, or he could have given him a few hints respecting rain, or mist, and could have informed him how far the moon's rays would rest on the pavement, and from which side the wind generally blew, and so on", ' On the bridge over the canal stood three persons, who wished to recommend themselves to the lamp, for they thought he could give the office to whomsoever he chose', " The first was a herring's head, which could emit light in the darkness", ' He remarked that it would be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the lamp-post  Number two was a piece of rotten wood, which also shines in the dark  He considered himself descended from an old stem, once the pride of the forest  The third was a glow-worm, and how he found his way there the lamp could not imagine, yet there he was, and could really give light as well as the others  An old couple once lived in a hut under a grove of palm trees, and they had one son and one daughter  They were all very happy together for many years, and then the father became very ill, and felt he was going to die', " He called his children to the place where he lay on the floor--for no one had any beds in that country--and said to his son, 'I have no herds of cattle to leave you--only the few things there are in the house--for I am a poor man, as you know", " But choose: will you have my blessing or my property?' 'Your property, certainly,' answered the son, and his father nodded", " 'And you?' asked the old man of the girl, who stood by her brother", " 'I will have blessing,' she answered, and her father gave her much blessing", ' That night he died, and his wife and son and daughter mourned for him seven days, and gave him a burial according to the custom of his people  But hardly was the time of mourning over, than the mother was attacked by a disease which was common in that country', " 'I am going away from you,' she said to her children, in a faint voice; 'but first, my son, choose which you will have: blessing or property", "' 'Property, certainly,' answered the son", " 'And you, my daughter?' 'I will have blessing,' said the girl; and her mother gave her much blessing, and that night she died", ' When the days of mourning were ended, the brother bade his sister put outside the hut all that belonged to his father and his mother  So the girl put them out, and he took them away, save only a small pot and a vessel in which she could clean her corn  But she had no corn to clean  She sat at home, sad and hungry, when a neighbour knocked at the door', " 'My pot has cracked in the fire, lend me yours to cook my supper in, and I will give you a handful of corn in return", "' And the girl was glad, and that night she was able to have supper herself, and next day another woman borrowed her pot, and then another and another, for never were known so many accidents as befell the village pots at that time", ' She soon grew quite fat with all the corn she earned with the help of her pot, and then one evening she picked up a pumpkin seed in a corner, and planted it near her well, and it sprang up, and gave her many pumpkins', " At last it happened that a youth from her village passed through the place where the girl's brother was, and the two met and talked", " 'What news is there of my sister?' asked the young man, with whom things had gone badly, for he was idle", " 'She is fat and well-liking,' replied the youth, 'for the women borrow her mortar to clean their corn, and borrow her pot to cook it in, and for al this they give her more food than she can eat", "' And he went his way", ' Now the brother was filled with envy at the words of the man, and he set out at once, and before dawn he had reached the hut, and saw the pot and the mortar were standing outside  He slung them over his shoulders and departed, pleased with his own cleverness; but when his sister awoke and sought for the pot to cook her corn for breakfast, she could find it nowhere', " At length she said to herself, 'Well, some thief must have stolen them while I slept", ' I will go and see if any of my pumpkins are ripe', "' And indeed they were, and so many that the tree was almost broken by the weight of them", ' So she ate what she wanted and took the others to the village, and gave them in exchange for corn, and the women said that no pumpkins were as sweet as these, and that she was to bring every day all that she had  In this way she earned more than she needed for herself, and soon was able to get another mortar and cooking pot in exchange for her corn  Then she thought she was quite rich  There lived a king who had an only son, on whom he doted  No one, not even his oldest tutor, was permitted to utter a word of correction to the prince whenever he did anything wrong, and so he grew up completely spoiled  He had many faults, but the worst features of his character were that he was proud, arrogant and cruel  Naturally, too, he was selfish and disobedient  When he was called to his lessons, he refused, saying, "I am a prince  Before many years I shall be your king  I have no need to learn what common people must know  Enough for me that I shall occupy the throne and shall rule  My will alone shall prevail  Says not the law of the land, \'The king can do no wrong\'?" Handsome and haughty, even as a youth, he made the king\'s subjects fear him by his imperious manner  His appearance in the streets was the signal for everyone to run into his house, bar the doors, and peer nervously through the casements  He was a reckless rider, and woe betide the unfortunate persons who happened to be in his way  Sparing neither man, woman, nor child, he callously rode over them, or lashed out vindictively with the long whip he always carried, laughing when anyone screamed with pain  So outrageous did his public conduct become that the people determined to suffer in silence no longer  They denounced the prince in public, they petitioned the king himself to restrain his son, and his majesty could not disregard the complaints  At first he was merely annoyed, then he was indignant, but when he saw that the people were thoroughly aroused and threatened revolt, he deemed it wise to inquire into the charges against his son  A commission of three judges was appointed to investigate  They made fullest inquiry and finally laid a document before the king summarizing what they did not hesitate to declare the "infamous actions of His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince " The king\'s sense of justice and righteousness at once overcame his foolish pride  "My people stand justified in their attitude which at first I thought only disrespectful to my royal person," he said  "I owe them an apology and recompense  I shall atone  And my son shall atone, too  He shall not escape punishment " He summoned his son to appear before him, and the prince entered the royal justice chamber with the air of a braggart, smiling contemptuously at the learned judges who were seated to right and left of his majesty, and defiantly cracking his whip  "Knowest thou why thou hast been bidden to stand before the judges of the land?" asked the king  "I know not and I care not," was the haughty answer  "The foolish chatter of the mob interests me not " The king frowned  He had not seen the prince behave in this fashion before  Once upon a time, in a savage country where the snow lies deep for many months in the year, there lived an owl and an eagle  Though they were so different in many ways they became great friends, and at length set up house together, one passing the day in hunting and the other the night  In this manner they did not see very much of each other--and perhaps agreed all the better for that; but at any rate they were perfectly happy, and only wanted one thing, or, rather, two things, and that was a wife for each', " 'I really am too tired when I come home in the evening to clean up the house,' said the eagle", " 'And I am much too sleepy at dawn after a long night's hunting to begin to sweep and dust,' answered the owl", ' And they both made up their minds that wives they must have  They flew about in their spare moments to the young ladies of their acquaintance, but the girls all declared they preferred one husband to two  The poor birds began to despair, when, one evening, after they had been for a wonder hunting together, they found two sisters fast asleep on their two beds  The eagle looked at the owl and the owl looked at the eagle', " 'They will make capital wives if they will only stay with us,' said they", ' And they flew off to give themselves a wash, and to make themselves smart before the girls awoke  For many hours the sisters slept on, for they had come a long way, from a town where there was scarcely anything to eat, and felt weak and tired  But by-and-by they opened their eyes and saw the two birds watching them', " 'I hope you are rested?' asked the owl politely", " 'Oh, yes, thank you,' answered the girls", " 'Only we are so very hungry", " Do you think we could have something to eat?' 'Certainly!' replied the eagle", ' And he flew away to a farmhouse a mile or two off, and brought back a nest of eggs in his strong beak; while the owl, catching up a tin pot, went to a cottage where lived an old woman and her cow, and entering the shed by the window dipped the pot into the pail of new milk that stood there  The girls were so much delighted with the kindness and cleverness of their hosts that, when the birds inquired if they would marry them and stay there for ever, they accepted without so much as giving it a second thought', " So the eagle took the younger sister to wife, and the owl the elder, and never was a home more peaceful than theirs! All went well for several months, and then the eagle's wife had a son, while, on the same day, the owl's wife gave birth to a frog, which she placed directly on the banks of a stream near by, as he did not seem to like the house", ' The children both grew quickly, and were never tired of playing together, or wanted any other companions', " One night in the spring, when the ice had melted, and the snow was gone, the sisters sat spinning in the house, awaiting their husbands' return", ' But long though they watched, neither the owl nor the eagle ever came; neither that day nor the next, nor the next, nor the next  At last the wives gave up all hope of their return; but, being sensible women, they did not sit down and cry, but called their children, and set out, determined to seek the whole world over till the missing husbands were found  Now the women had no idea in which direction the lost birds had gone, but they knew that some distance off was a thick forest, where good hunting was to be found  It seemed a likely place to find them, or, at any rate, they might hear something of them, and they walked quickly on, cheered by the thought that they were doing something  Suddenly the younger sister, who was a little in front, gave a cry of surprise', " 'Oh! look at that lake!' she said, 'we shall never get across it", "' 'Yes we shall,' answered the elder; 'I know what to do", "' And taking a long piece of string from her pocket, fastened it into the frog's mouth, like a bit" ,  ' Ikkor, the Jewish vizier of the king of Assyria, was the wisest man in the land, but he was not happy  He was the greatest favorite of the king who heaped honors upon him, and the idol of the people who bowed before him in the streets and cast themselves on the ground at his feet to kiss the hem of his garment  Always he had a kindly word and a smile for those who sought his advice and guidance, but his eyes were ever sad, and tears would trickle down his cheeks as he watched the little children at play in the streets  His fame as a man of wisdom was known far beyond the borders of Assyria, and rulers feared to give offense to the king who had Ikkor as the chief of his counselors to assist in the affairs of state  But Ikkor would oft sit alone in his beautiful palace and sigh heavily', " No sound of children's laughter was ever heard in the palace of Ikkor, and that was the cause of his sorrow", ' Ikkor was a pious man and deeply learned in the Holy Law; and he had prayed long and devoutly and had listened unto the advice of magicians that he might be blessed with but one son, or even a daughter, to carry down his name and renown  But the years passed and no child was born to him  Every year, on the advice of the king, he married another wife, and now he had in his harem thirty wives, all childless  He determined to take unto himself no more wives, and one night he dreamed a dream in which a spirit appeared to him and said: "Ikkor, thou wilt die full of years and honor, but childless  Therefore, take Nadan, the son of thy widowed sister and let him be a son to thee " Nadan was a handsome youth of fifteen, and Ikkor related his dream to the boy\'s mother who permitted him to take Nadan to his palace and there bring him up as his own son', " The sadness faded from the vizier's eyes as he watched the lad at his games and his lessons, and Ikkor himself imparted wisdom to Nadan", ' But, first to his surprise, and then to his grief, Nadan was not thankful for the riches and love lavished upon him  He neglected his lessons and grew proud, haughty and arrogant  He treated the servants of the household harshly and did not obey the wise maxims of Ikkor  The vizier, however, was hopeful that he would reform and gain wisdom with years, and he took him to the palace of the king and appointed him an officer of the royal guard', " For Ikkor's sake, the king made Nadan one of his favorites, and all in the land looked upon the young man as the successor of Ikkor and the future vizier", ' This only served to make Nadan still more arrogant, and a wicked idea entered his head to gain further favor with the king and supplant Ikkor at once  "O King, live for ever!" he said one day, when Ikkor was absent in a distant part of the land; "it grieves me to have to utter words of warning against Ikkor, the wise, the father who has adopted me  But he conspires to destroy thee " The king laughed at this suggestion, but he became serious when Nadan promised to give him proof in three days  Nadan then set to work and wrote two letters  One was addressed to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and read as follows: "Pharaoh, son of the Sun and mighty ruler on earth, live for ever! Thou wouldst reign over Assyria  Give ear then to my words and on the tenth day of the next month come with thy troops to the Eagle Plain beyond the city, and I, Ikkor, the grand vizier, will deliver thine enemy, the King of Assyria, into thy hands " To this letter he forged Ikkor\'s name; then he took it to the king  "I have found this," he said, "and have brought it to thee  It shows thee that Ikkor would deliver this country to thine enemy " The king was very angry and would have sent for Ikkor at once, but Nadan counseled patience  "Wait until the tenth of next month, the day of the annual review, and thou wilt see what will surprise thee still more," he said  East of the Land of the Rising Sun there dwelled a king who spent all his days and half his nights in pleasure  His kingdom was on the edge of the world, according to the knowledge of those times, and almost entirely surrounded by the sea  Nobody seemed to care what lay beyond the barrier of rocks that shut off the land from the rest of the world  For the matter of that, nobody appeared to trouble much about anything in that kingdom  Most of the people followed the example of the king and led idle, careless lives, giving no thought to the future  The king regarded the task of governing his subjects as a big nuisance; he did not care to be worried with proposals concerning the welfare of the masses, and documents brought to him by his advisors for signature were never read  For aught he knew they may have referred to the school regulations of the moon, instead of the laws of trading and such like public matters  "Don\'t bother me," was his usual remark  "You are my advisors and officers of state  Deal with affairs as you think best " And off he would go to his beloved hunting which was his favorite pastime  The land was fertile, and nobody had ever entertained an idea that bad weather might some year affect the crops and cause a scarcity of grain  They took no precautions to lay in stocks of wheat, and so when one summer there was a great lack of rain and the fields were parched, the winter that followed was marked by suffering  The kingdom was faced by famine, and the people did not like it  They did not know what to do, and when they appealed to the king, he could not help them  Indeed, he could not understand the difficulty  He passed it off very lightly  "I am a mighty hunter," he said  "I can always kill enough beasts to provide a sufficiency of food " But the drought had withered away the grass and the trees, and the shortage of such food had greatly reduced the number of animals  The king found the forests empty of deer and birds  Still he failed to realize the gravity of the situation and what he considered an exceedingly bright idea struck him  "I will explore the unknown territory beyond the barrier of rocky hills," he said  "Surely there will I find a land of plenty  And, at least" he added, "it will be a pleasant adventure with good hunting " A great expedition was therefore arranged, and the king and his hunting companions set forth to find a path over the rocks  This was not at all difficult, and on the third day, a pass was discovered among the crags and peaks that formed the summit of the barrier, and the king saw the region beyond  It seemed a vast and beautiful land, stretching away as far as the eye could see in a forest of huge trees  Carefully, the hunters descended the other side of the rock barrier and entered the unknown land  It seemed uninhabited  Hiram, king of Tyre, was a foolish old man  He lived so long and grew to such a venerable age that he absuredly imagined he would never die  The idea gained strength daily in his mind and thus he mused: "David, king of the Jews, I knew, and afterward his son, the wise King Solomon  But wise as he was, Solomon had to appeal to me for assistance in building his wondrous Temple, and it was only with the aid of the skilled workmen I sent to him that he successfully accomplished the erection of that structure  David, the sweet singer in Israel, who, as a mere boy slew the giant Goliath, has passed away  I still live  It must be that I shall never die  Men die  Gods live for ever  I must be a god, and why not?" He put that question to the chief of his counselors, who, however, was much too wise to answer it  Now the counselors of the king had never yet failed to answer his queries, and so Hiram felt sure he had at last puzzled them by a question beyond the power of mortal man to answer  That was another proof, he told himself, that he was different from other men and kings--that, in short, he was a god  "I must be, I must be," he muttered to himself, and he repeated this to himself so regularly that he came to the conclusion it was true  "It is not I, but the voice of the Spirit of God that is in me that speaks," he said to himself, and he thought this remark so clever that he regarded it as still further proof', " It is so easy to delude one's self", ' Then he decided to make the great secret known to the people, and the doddering old man thought if he would do this in an unusual way, his subjects would have no doubts  He did not make a proclamation commanding everybody to believe in him as a god; he whispered the secret first to his chief counselor and instructed him to tell it to one person daily and to order all who were informed to do likewise  In this way the news soon spread to the remotest corners of the country, for if you work out a little sum you will discover that if you take the figure one and double it thus: two, four, eight, sixteen, and so on, it will run into millions  In spite of this, nothing happened  Hiram, now quite idiotic, commanded the people to worship him  Some obeyed, fearing that if they refused they would be punished, or even put to death  Others declared there was no evidence that the king was a god  This came to the knowledge of Hiram and troubled him sorely  "What proof do the unbelievers require?" he asked of his counselors  They hesitated to reply, but presently the vizier, a shrewd old man with a long beard, said quietly, "I have heard people say a god must have a heaven from which to hurl lightning and thunderbolts, and a paradise in which to dwell " "I shall have a heaven and a paradise," said Hiram, after a few moments\' silence, adding to himself: "If Solomon could build a marvelous temple by the help of my workmen, surely I can devise a paradise " He spent so much thought over this that it seemed to become easier each day  Besides, it would be so nice to live in a paradise all to himself  At first he decided to build a great big palace of gold, with windows of precious stones  There would be a high tower on which the throne would be placed so far above the people that they must be impressed with the fact that he was God  There were once five peas in one shell, they were green, the shell was green, and so they believed that the whole world must be green also, which was a very natural conclusion  The shell grew, and the peas grew, they accommodated themselves to their position, and sat all in a row  The sun shone without and warmed the shell, and the rain made it clear and transparent; it was mild and agreeable in broad daylight, and dark at night, as it generally is; and the peas as they sat there grew bigger and bigger, and more thoughtful as they mused, for they felt there must be something else for them to do  "Are we to sit here forever?" asked one; "shall we not become hard by sitting so long? It seems to me there must be something outside, and I feel sure of it " And as weeks passed by, the peas became yellow, and the shell became yellow  "All the world is turning yellow, I suppose," said they,--and perhaps they were right  Suddenly they felt a pull at the shell; it was torn off, and held in human hands, then slipped into the pocket of a jacket in company with other full pods  "Now we shall soon be opened," said one,--just what they all wanted  "I should like to know which of us will travel furthest," said the smallest of the five; "we shall soon see now " "What is to happen will happen," said the largest pea  "Crack" went the shell as it burst, and the five peas rolled out into the bright sunshine', " There they lay in a child's hand", ' A little boy was holding them tightly, and said they were fine peas for his pea-shooter  And immediately he put one in and shot it out  "Now I am flying out into the wide world," said he; "catch me if you can;" and he was gone in a moment  "I," said the second, "intend to fly straight to the sun, that is a shell that lets itself be seen, and it will suit me exactly;" and away he went  "We will go to sleep wherever we find ourselves," said the two next, "we shall still be rolling onwards;" and they did certainly fall on the floor, and roll about before they got into the pea-shooter; but they were put in for all that  "We shall go farther than the others," said they  "What is to happen will happen," exclaimed the last, as he was shot out of the pea-shooter; and as he spoke he flew up against an old board under a garret-window, and fell into a little crevice, which was almost filled up with moss and soft earth  The moss closed itself round him, and there he lay, a captive indeed, but not unnoticed by God  "What is to happen will happen," said he to himself  Within the little garret lived a poor woman, who went out to clean stoves, chop wood into small pieces and perform such-like hard work, for she was strong and industrious  Yet she remained always poor, and at home in the garret lay her only daughter, not quite grown up, and very delicate and weak  For a whole year she had kept her bed, and it seemed as if she could neither live nor die  "She is going to her little sister," said the woman; "I had but the two children, and it was not an easy thing to support both of them; but the good God helped me in my work, and took one of them to Himself and provided for her  Now I would gladly keep the other that was left to me, but I suppose they are not to be separated, and my sick girl will very soon go to her sister above " But the sick girl still remained where she was, quietly and patiently she lay all the day long, while her mother was away from home at her work  Spring came, and one morning early the sun shone brightly through the little window, and threw its rays over the floor of the room  Just as the mother was going to her work, the sick girl fixed her gaze on the lowest pane of the window--"Mother," she exclaimed, "what can that little green thing be that peeps in at the window? It is moving in the wind " The mother stepped to the window and half opened it In a poet\'s room, where his inkstand stood on the table, the remark was once made, "It is wonderful what can be brought out of an inkstand  What will come next? It is indeed wonderful " "Yes, certainly," said the inkstand to the pen, and to the other articles that stood on the table; "that\'s what I always say  It is wonderful and extraordinary what a number of things come out of me', " It's quite incredible, and I really don't know what is coming next when that man dips his pen into me", ' One drop out of me is enough for half a page of paper, and what cannot half a page contain? From me, all the works of a poet are produced; all those imaginary characters whom people fancy they have known or met  All the deep feeling, the humor, and the vivid pictures of nature', " I myself don't understand how it is, for I am not acquainted with nature, but it is certainly in me", ' From me have gone forth to the world those wonderful descriptions of troops of charming maidens, and of brave knights on prancing steeds; of the halt and the blind, and I know not what more, for I assure you I never think of these things " "There you are right," said the pen, "for you don\'t think at all; if you did, you would see that you can only provide the means  You give the fluid that I may place upon the paper what dwells in me, and what I wish to bring to light  It is the pen that writes: no man doubts that; and, indeed, most people understand as much about poetry as an old inkstand " "You have had very little experience," replied the inkstand  "You have hardly been in service a week, and are already half worn out  Do you imagine you are a poet? You are only a servant, and before you came I had many like you, some of the goose family, and others of English manufacture  I know a quill pen as well as I know a steel one  I have had both sorts in my service, and I shall have many more when he comes--the man who performs the mechanical part--and writes down what he obtains from me  I should like to know what will be the next thing he gets out of me " "Inkpot!" exclaimed the pen contemptuously  Late in the evening the poet came home  He had been to a concert, and had been quite enchanted with the admirable performance of a famous violin player whom he had heard there  The performer had produced from his instrument a richness of tone that sometimes sounded like tinkling waterdrops or rolling pearls; sometimes like the birds twittering in chorus, and then rising and swelling in sound like the wind through the fir-trees', " The poet felt as if his own heart were weeping, but in tones of melody like the sound of a woman's voice", ' It seemed not only the strings, but every part of the instrument from which these sounds were produced  It was a wonderful performance and a difficult piece, and yet the bow seemed to glide across the strings so easily that it was as if any one could do it who tried  Even the violin and the bow appeared to perform independently of their master who guided them; it was as if soul and spirit had been breathed into the instrument, so the audience forgot the performer in the beautiful sounds he produced  Not so the poet; he remembered him, and named him, and wrote down his thoughts on the subject  "How foolish it would be for the violin and the bow to boast of their performance, and yet we men often commit that folly  The poet, the artist, the man of science in his laboratory, the general,--we all do it; and yet we are only the instruments which the Almighty uses; to Him alone the honor is due  We have nothing of ourselves of which we should be proud' ,  " Far away towards the east, in India, which seemed in those days the world's end, stood the Tree of the Sun; a noble tree, such as we have never seen, and perhaps never may see", ' The summit of this tree spread itself for miles like an entire forest, each of its smaller branches forming a complete tree  Palms, beech-trees, pines, plane-trees, and various other kinds, which are found in all parts of the world, were here like small branches, shooting forth from the great tree; while the larger boughs, with their knots and curves, formed valleys and hills, clothed with velvety green and covered with flowers  Everywhere it was like a blooming meadow or a lovely garden  Here were birds from all quarters of the world assembled together; birds from the primeval forests of America, from the rose gardens of Damascus, and from the deserts of Africa, in which the elephant and the lion may boast of being the only rulers  Birds from the Polar regions came flying here, and of course the stork and the swallow were not absent  But the birds were not the only living creatures  There were stags, squirrels, antelopes, and hundreds of other beautiful and light-footed animals here found a home  The summit of the tree was a wide-spreading garden, and in the midst of it, where the green boughs formed a kind of hill, stood a castle of crystal, with a view from it towards every quarter of heaven  Each tower was erected in the form of a lily, and within the stern was a winding staircase, through which one could ascend to the top and step out upon the leaves as upon balconies  The calyx of the flower itself formed a most beautiful, glittering, circular hall, above which no other roof arose than the blue firmament and the sun and stars  Just as much splendor, but of another kind, appeared below, in the wide halls of the castle  Here, on the walls, were reflected pictures of the world, which represented numerous and varied scenes of everything that took place daily, so that it was useless to read the newspapers, and indeed there were none to be obtained in this spot  All was to be seen in living pictures by those who wished it, but all would have been too much for even the wisest man, and this man dwelt here  His name is very difficult; you would not be able to pronounce it, so it may be omitted  He knew everything that a man on earth can know or imagine  Every invention already in existence or yet to be, was known to him, and much more; still everything on earth has a limit  The wise king Solomon was not half so wise as this man  He could govern the powers of nature and held sway over potent spirits; even Death itself was obliged to give him every morning a list of those who were to die during the day  And King Solomon himself had to die at last, and this fact it was which so often occupied the thoughts of this great man in the castle on the Tree of the Sun  He knew that he also, however high he might tower above other men in wisdom, must one day die  He knew that his children would fade away like the leaves of the forest and become dust  He saw the human race wither and fall like leaves from the tree; he saw new men come to fill their places, but the leaves that fell off never sprouted forth again; they crumbled to dust or were absorbed into other plants  "What happens to man," asked the wise man of himself, "when touched by the angel of death? What can death be? The body decays, and the soul  Yes; what is the soul, and whither does it go?" "To eternal life," says the comforting voice of religion  "But what is this change? Where and how shall we exist?" "Above; in heaven," answers the pious man; "it is there we hope to go " "Above!" repeated the wise man, fixing his eyes upon the moon and stars above him  He saw that to this earthly sphere above and below were constantly changing places, and that the position varied according to the spot on which a man found himself  He knew, also, that even if he ascended to the top of the highest mountain which rears its lofty summit on this earth, the air, which to us seems clear and transparent, would there be dark and cloudy; the sun would have a coppery glow and send forth no rays, and our earth would lie beneath him wrapped in an orange-colored mist  How narrow are the limits which confine the bodily sight, and how little can be seen by the eye of the soul  In the Garden of Paradise, beneath the Tree of Knowledge, bloomed a rose bush  Here, in the first rose, a bird was born  His flight was like the flashing of light, his plumage was beauteous, and his song ravishing  But when Eve plucked the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, when she and Adam were driven from Paradise, there fell from the flaming sword of the cherub a spark into the nest of the bird, which blazed up forthwith  The bird perished in the flames; but from the red egg in the nest there fluttered aloft a new one--the one solitary Phoenix bird  The fable tells that he dwells in Arabia, and that every hundred years, he burns himself to death in his nest; but each time a new Phoenix, the only one in the world, rises up from the red egg  The bird flutters round us, swift as light, beauteous in color, charming in song', " When a mother sits by her infant's cradle, he stands on the pillow, and, with his wings, forms a glory around the infant's head", ' He flies through the chamber of content, and brings sunshine into it, and the violets on the humble table smell doubly sweet  But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone  He wings his way in the glimmer of the Northern Lights over the plains of Lapland, and hops among the yellow flowers in the short Greenland summer', " Beneath the copper mountains of Fablun, and England's coal mines, he flies, in the shape of a dusty moth, over the hymnbook that rests on the knees of the pious miner", ' On a lotus leaf he floats down the sacred waters of the Ganges, and the eye of the Hindoo maid gleams bright when she beholds him  The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him? The Bird of Paradise, the holy swan of song! On the car of Thespis he sat in the guise of a chattering raven, and flapped his black wings, smeared with the lees of wine; over the sounding harp of Iceland swept the swan\'s red beak; on Shakspeare\'s shoulder he sat in the guise of Odin\'s raven, and whispered in the poet\'s ear "Immortality!" and at the minstrels\' feast he fluttered through the halls of the Wartburg  The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him? He sang to thee the Marseillaise, and thou kissedst the pen that fell from his wing; he came in the radiance of Paradise, and perchance thou didst turn away from him towards the sparrow who sat with tinsel on his wings  The Bird of Paradise--renewed each century--born in flame, ending in flame! Thy picture, in a golden frame, hangs in the halls of the rich, but thou thyself often fliest around, lonely and disregarded, a myth--"The Phoenix of Arabia " In Paradise, when thou wert born in the first rose, beneath the Tree of Knowledge, thou receivedst a kiss, and thy right name was given thee--thy name, Poetry    ' ,  " Once upon a time the Bodhisatta was a Pigeon, and lived in a nest-basket which a rich man's cook had hung up in the kitchen, in order to earn merit by it", ' A greedy Crow, flying near, saw all sorts of delicate food lying about in the kitchen, and fell a-hungering after it  "How in the world can I get some?" thought he? At last he hit upon a plan  When the Pigeon went to search for food, behind him, following, following, came the Crow  "What do you want, Mr', " Crow? You and I don't feed alike", '" "Ah, but I like you and your ways! Let me be your chum, and let us feed together " The Pigeon agreed, and they went on in company  The Crow pretended to feed along with the Pigeon, but ever and anon he would turn back, peck to bits some heap of cow-dung, and eat a fat worm  When he had got a bellyful of them, up he flies, as pert as you like: "Hullo, Mr  Pigeon, what a time you take over your meal! One ought to draw the line somewhere', " Let's be going home before it is too late", '" And so they did  The cook saw that his Pigeon had brought a friend, and hung up another basket for him', " A few days afterwards there was a great purchase of fish which came to the rich man's kitchen", ' How the Crow longed for some! So there he lay, from early morn, groaning and making a great noise  Says the Pigeon to the Crow: "Come, Sir Crow, and get your breakfast!" "Oh dear! oh dear! I have such a fit of indigestion!" says he  "Nonsense! Crows never have indigestion," said the Pigeon  "If you eat a lamp-wick, that stays in your stomach a little while; but anything else is digested in a trice, as soon as you eat it', " Now do what I tell you; don't behave in this way just for seeing a little fish", '" "Why do you say that, master? I have indigestion " "Well, be careful," said the Pigeon, and flew away  The cook prepared all the dishes, and then stood at the kitchen door, wiping the sweat off his body  "Now\'s my time!" thought Mr  Crow, and alighted on a dish containing some dainty food  Click! The cook heard it, and looked round', " Ah! he caught the Crow, and plucked all the feathers out of his head, all but one tuft; he powdered ginger and cummin, mixed it up with butter-milk, and rubbed it well all over the bird's body", ' "That\'s for spoiling my master\'s dinner and making me throw it away!" said he, and threw him into his basket  Oh, how it hurt! By-and-by the Pigeon came in, and saw the Crow lying there, making a great noise  He made great game of him, and repeated a verse of poetry:   "Who is this tufted crane I see   Lying where he\'s no right to be?   Come out! my friend, the crow is near,   And he may do you harm, I fear!" To this the Crow answered with another:   "No tufted crane am I--no, no!   I\'m nothing but a greedy crow  In the old times there was a half fool living in Dunmore, in the county Galway, and though he was excessively fond of music, he was unable to learn more than one tune, and that was the "Black Rogue " He used to get a good deal of money from the gentlemen, for they used to get sport out of him  One night the Piper was coming home from a house where there had been a dance, and he half drunk  When he came up to a little bridge that was by his mother\'s house, he squeezed the pipes on, and began playing the "Black Rogue " The Puca came behind him, and flung him on his own back  There were long horns on the Puca, and the Piper got a good grip of them, and then he said: "Destruction on you, you nasty beast; let me home  I have a tenpenny-piece in my pocket for my mother, and she wants snuff " "Never mind your mother," said the Puca, "but keep your hold  If you fall, you will break your neck and your pipes " Then the Puca said to him, "Play up for me the \'Shan Van Vocht \'" "I don\'t know it," said the Piper  "Never mind whether you do or you don\'t," said the Puca  "Play up, and I\'ll make you know " The Piper put wind in his bag, and he played such music as made himself wonder  "Upon my word, you\'re a fine music-master," says the Piper, then; "but tell me where you\'re for bringing me " "There\'s a great feast in the house of the Banshee, on the top of Croagh Patric, to-night," says the Puca, "and I\'m for bringing you there to play music, and, take my word, you\'ll get the price of your trouble " "By my word, you\'ll save me a journey, then," says the Piper, "for Father William put a journey to Croagh Patric on me because I stole the white gander from him last Martinmas " The Puca rushed him across hills and bogs and rough places, till he brought him to the top of Croagh Patric  Then the Puca struck three blows with his foot, and a great door opened and they passed in together into a fine room  The Piper saw a golden table in the middle of the room, and hundreds of old women sitting round about it  The old women rose up, and said, "A hundred thousand welcomes to you, you Puca of November  Who is this you have with you?" "The best Piper in Ireland," says the Puca  One of the old women struck a blow on the ground, and a door opened in the side of the wall, and what should the Piper see coming out but the white gander which he had stolen from Father William  "By my conscience, then," says the Piper, "myself and my mother ate every taste of that gander, only one wing, and I gave that to Red Mary, and it\'s she told the priest I stole his gander " The gander cleaned the table, and carried it away, and the Puca said, "Play up music for these ladies " The Piper played up, and the old women began dancing, and they were dancing till they were tired  Then the Puca said to pay the Piper, and every old woman drew out a gold piece and gave it to him  "By the tooth of Patric," says he, "I\'m as rich as the son of a lord " "Come with me," says the Puca, "and I\'ll bring you home " They went out then, and just as he was going to ride on the Puca, the gander came up to him and gave him a new set of pipes  Nearly a thousand years ago in the town of Mayence, on the bank of the Rhine, there dwelt a pious Jew of the name of Simon ben Isaac  Of a most charitable disposition, learned and ever ready to assist the poor with money and wise counsel, he was reverenced by all, and it was believed he was a direct descendant of King David  Everybody was proud to do him honor  Simon ben Isaac had one little son, a bright boy of the name of Elkanan, who he intended should be trained as a rabbi  Little Elkanan was very diligent in his studies and gave early promise of developing into an exceptionally clever student  Even the servants in the household loved him for his keen intelligence  One of them, indeed, was unduly interested in him  She was the Sabbath-fire woman who only came into the house on the Sabbath day to attend to the fires, because, as you know, the Jewish servants could not perform this duty  The Sabbath-fire woman was a devoted Catholic and she spoke of Elkanan to a priest  The latter was considerably impressed  "What a pity," he remarked, "that so talented a boy should be a Jew  If he were a Christian, now," he added, winningly, "he could enter the Holy Church and become famous " The Sabbath-fire woman knew exactly what the priest meant  "Do you think he could rise to be a bishop?" she asked  "He might rise even higher--to be the Pope himself," replied the priest  "It would be a great thing to give a bishop to the Church, would it not?" said the woman  "It is a great thing to give anyone to the Church of Rome," the priest assured her  Then they spoke in whispers  The woman appeared a little troubled, but the priest promised her that all would be well, that she would be rewarded, and that nobody would dare to accuse her of doing anything wrong  Convinced that she was performing a righteous action, she agreed to do what the priest suggested', " Accordingly, the following Friday night when the household of Simon ben Isaac was wrapped in slumber, she crept stealthily and silently into the boy's bedroom", ' Taking him gently in her arms, she stole silently out of the house and carried him to the priest who was waiting  Elkanan was well wrapped up in blankets, and so cautiously did the woman move that he did not waken  The priest said not a word  He just nodded to the woman, and then placed Elkanan in a carriage which he had in waiting  Elkanan slept peacefully, totally unaware of his adventure, and when he opened his eyes he thought he must be dreaming  He was not in his own room, but a much smaller one which seemed to be jolting and moving, like a carriage, and opposite to him was a priest  "Where am I?" he asked in alarm  "Lie still, Andreas," was the reply  "But my name is not Andreas," he answered  The General lived in the grand first floor, and the porter lived in the cellar  There was a great distance between the two families--the whole of the ground floor, and the difference in rank; but they lived in the same house, and both had a view of the street, and of the courtyard  In the courtyard was a grass-plot, on which grew a blooming acacia tree (when it was in bloom), and under this tree sat occasionally the finely-dressed nurse, with the still more finely-dressed child of the General--little Emily  Before them danced about barefoot the little son of the porter, with his great brown eyes and dark hair; and the little girl smiled at him, and stretched out her hands towards him; and when the General saw that from the window, he would nod his head and cry, "Charming!" The General\'s lady (who was so young that she might very well have been her husband\'s daughter from an early marriage) never came to the window that looked upon the courtyard  She had given orders, though, that the boy might play his antics to amuse her child, but must never touch it', " The nurse punctually obeyed the gracious lady's orders", ' The sun shone in upon the people in the grand first floor, and upon the people in the cellar; the acacia tree was covered with blossoms, and they fell off, and next year new ones came', " The tree bloomed, and the porter's little son bloomed too, and looked like a fresh tulip", " The General's little daughter became delicate and pale, like the leaf of the acacia blossom", ' She seldom came down to the tree now, for she took the air in a carriage', " She drove out with her mamma, and then she would always nod at the porter's George; yes, she used even to kiss her hand to him, till her mamma said she was too old to do that now", " One morning George was sent up to carry the General the letters and newspapers that had been delivered at the porter's room in the morning", ' As he was running up stairs, just as he passed the door of the sand-box, he heard a faint piping', " He thought it was some young chicken that had strayed there, and was raising cries of distress; but it was the General's little daughter, decked out in lace and finery", ' "Don\'t tell papa and mamma," she whimpered; "they would be angry " "What\'s the matter, little missie?" asked George  "It\'s all on fire!" she answered  "It\'s burning with a bright flame!" George hurried up stairs to the General\'s apartments; he opened the door of the nursery  The window curtain was almost entirely burnt, and the wooden curtain-pole was one mass of flame  George sprang upon a chair he brought in haste, and pulled down the burning articles; he then alarmed the people  But for him, the house would have been burned down  The General and his lady cross-questioned little Emily  "I only took just one lucifer-match," she said, "and it was burning directly, and the curtain was burning too  I spat at it, to put it out; I spat at it as much as ever I could, but I could not put it out; so I ran away and hid myself, for papa and mamma would be angry " "I spat!" cried the General\'s lady; "what an expression! Did you ever hear your papa and mamma talk about spitting? You must have got that from down stairs!" And George had a penny given him', " But this penny did not go to the baker's shop, but into the savings-box; and soon there were so many pennies in the savings-box that he could buy a paint-box and color the drawings he made, and he had a great number of drawings", " They seemed to shoot out of his pencil and out of his fingers' ends", ' His first colored pictures he presented to Emily  "Charming!" said the General, and even the General\'s lady acknowledged that it was easy to see what the boy had meant to draw  "He has genius  A duck once arrived from Portugal, but there were some who said she came from Spain, which is almost the same thing  At all events, she was called the "Portuguese," and she laid eggs, was killed, and cooked, and there was an end of her  But the ducklings which crept forth from the eggs were also called "Portuguese," and about that there may be some question  But of all the family one only remained in the duckyard, which may be called a farmyard, as the chickens were admitted, and the cock strutted about in a very hostile manner  "He annoys me with his loud crowing," said the Portuguese duck; "but, still, he\'s a handsome bird, there\'s no denying that, although he\'s not a drake', " He ought to moderate his voice, like those little birds who are singing in the lime-trees over there in our neighbor's garden, but that is an art only acquired in polite society", ' How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them! I call it Portuguese singing', " If I had only such a little singing-bird, I'd be kind and good as a mother to him, for it's in my nature, in my Portuguese blood", '" While she was speaking, one of the little singing-birds came tumbling head over heels from the roof into the yard  The cat was after him, but he had escaped from her with a broken wing, and so came tumbling into the yard  "That\'s just like the cat, she\'s a villain," said the Portuguese duck  "I remember her ways when I had children of my own  How can such a creature be allowed to live, and wander about upon the roofs', " I don't think they allow such things in Portugal", '" She pitied the little singing-bird, and so did all the other ducks who were not Portuguese  "Poor little creature!" they said, one after another, as they came up  "We can\'t sing, certainly; but we have a sounding-board, or something of the kind, within us; we can feel that, though we don\'t talk about it " "But I can talk," said the Portuguese duck; "and I\'ll do something for the little fellow; it\'s my duty;" and she stepped into the water-trough, and beat her wings upon the water so strongly that the bird was nearly drowned by a shower-bath; but the duck meant it kindly  "That is a good deed," she said; "I hope the others will take example by it " "Tweet, tweet!" said the little bird, for one of his wings being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, "You are very kind-hearted, madam;" but he did not wish for a second bath  "I have never thought about my heart," replied the Portuguese duck, "but I know that I love all my fellow-creatures, except the cat, and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of my ducklings', " But pray make yourself at home; it is easy to make one's self comfortable", ' I am myself from a foreign country, as you may see by my feathery dress', " My drake is a native of these parts; he's not of my race; but I am not proud on that account", ' If any one here can understand you, I may say positively I am that person " "She\'s quite full of \'Portulak,\'" said a little common duck, who was witty  All the common ducks considered the word "Portulak" a good joke, for it sounded like Portugal  They nudged each other, and said, "Quack! that was witty!" Then the other ducks began to notice the little bird  "The Portuguese had certainly a great flow of language," they said to the little bird  "For our part we don\'t care to fill our beaks with such long words, but we sympathize with you quite as much  Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her, a large Raven came hopping over the white snow  He had long been looking at Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, "Caw! Caw!" Good day! Good day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the little girl, and asked her where she was going all alone  The word "alone" Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed by it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not seen Kay  The Raven nodded very gravely, and said, "It may be--it may be!" "What, do you really think so?" cried the little girl; and she nearly squeezed the Raven to death, so much did she kiss him  "Gently, gently," said the Raven  "I think I know; I think that it may be little Kay  But now he has forgotten you for the Princess " "Does he live with a Princess?" asked Gerda  "Yes--listen," said the Raven; "but it will be difficult for me to speak your language  If you understand the Raven language I can tell you better " "No, I have not learnt it," said Gerda; "but my grandmother understands it, and she can speak gibberish too  I wish I had learnt it " "No matter," said the Raven; "I will tell you as well as I can; however, it will be bad enough " And then he told all he knew  "In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is extraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole world, and has forgotten them again--so clever is she', " She was lately, it is said, sitting on her throne--which is not very amusing after all--when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, 'Oh, why should I not be married?' 'That song is not without its meaning,' said she, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a husband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to--not one who looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so tiresome", " She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and when they heard her intention, all were very pleased, and said, 'We are very glad to hear it; it is the very thing we were thinking of", '\' You may believe every word I say," said the Raven; "for I have a tame sweetheart that hops about in the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all this  "The newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the initials of the Princess; and therein you might read that every good-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to the Princess; and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at home there, that one the Princess would choose for her husband  "Yes, Yes," said the Raven, "you may believe it; it is as true as I am sitting here  People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but no one was successful either on the first or second day  They could all talk well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as they came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed in silver, and the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large illuminated saloons, then they were abashed; and when they stood before the throne on which the Princess was sitting, all they could do was to repeat the last word they had uttered, and to hear it again did not interest her very much  It was just as if the people within were under a charm, and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the street; for then--oh, then--they could chatter enough  There was a whole row of them standing from the town-gates to the palace  I was there myself to look," said the Raven  "They grew hungry and thirsty; but from the palace they got nothing whatever, not even a glass of water', " Some of the cleverest, it is true, had taken bread and butter with them: but none shared it with his neighbor, for each thought, 'Let him look hungry, and then the Princess won't have him", '\'" "But Kay--little Kay," said Gerda, "when did he come? Was he among the number?" "Patience, patience; we are just come to him  It was on the third day when a little personage without horse or equipage, came marching right boldly up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful long hair, but his clothes were very shabby " "That was Kay," cried Gerda, with a voice of delight  Once upon a time there lived an emperor who had three sons  They were all fine young men, and fond of hunting, and scarcely a day passed without one or other of them going out to look for game  One morning the eldest of the three princes mounted his horse and set out for a neighbouring forest, where wild animals of all sorts were to be found  He had not long left the castle, when a hare sprang out of a thicket and dashed across the road in front  The young man gave chase at once, and pursued it over hill and dale, till at last the hare took refuge in a mill which was standing by the side of a river  The prince followed and entered the mill, but stopped in terror by the door, for, instead of a hare, before him stood a dragon, breathing fire and flame', " At this fearful sight the prince turned to fly, but a fiery tongue coiled round his waist, and drew him into the dragon's mouth, and he was seen no more", ' A week passed away, and when the prince never came back everyone in the town began to grow uneasy', " At last his next brother told the emperor that he likewise would go out to hunt, and that perhaps he would find some clue as to his brother's disappearance", ' But hardly had the castle gates closed on the prince than the hare sprang out of the bushes as before, and led the huntsman up hill and down dale, till they reached the mill', " Into this the hare flew with the prince at his heels, when, lo! instead of the hare, there stood a dragon breathing fire and flame; and out shot a fiery tongue which coiled round the prince's waist, and lifted him straight into the dragon's mouth, and he was seen no more", ' Days went by, and the emperor waited and waited for the sons who never came, and could not sleep at night for wondering where they were and what had become of them  His youngest son wished to go in search of his brothers, but for long the emperor refused to listen to him, lest he should lose him also  But the prince prayed so hard for leave to make the search, and promised so often that he would be very cautious and careful, that at length the emperor gave him permission, and ordered the best horse in the stables to be saddled for him  Full of hope the young prince started on his way, but no sooner was he outside the city walls than a hare sprang out of the bushes and ran before him, till they reached the mill  As before, the animal dashed in through the open door, but this time he was not followed by the prince', " Wiser than his brothers, the young man turned away, saying to himself: 'There are as good hares in the forest as any that have come out of it, and when I have caught them, I can come back and look for you", "' For many hours he rode up and down the mountain, but saw nothing, and at last, tired of waiting, he went back to the mill", ' Here he found an old woman sitting, whom he greeted pleasantly', " 'Good morning to you, little mother,' he said; and the old woman answered: 'Good morning, my son", "' 'Tell me, little mother,' went on the prince, 'where shall I find my hare?' 'My son,' replied the old woman, 'that was no hare, but a dragon who has led many men hither, and then has eaten them all", "' At these words the prince's heart grew heavy, and he cried, 'Then my brothers must have come here, and have been eaten by the dragon!' 'You have guessed right,' answered the old woman; 'and I can give you no better counsel than to go home at once, before the same fate overtakes you", "' 'Will you not come with me out of this dreadful place?' said the young man", " 'He took me prisoner, too,' answered she, 'and I cannot shake off his chains", "' 'Then listen to me,' cried the prince", " 'When the dragon comes back, ask him where he always goes when he leaves here, and what makes him so strong; and when you have coaxed the secret from him, tell me the next time I come", "' So the prince went home, and the old woman remained in the mill, and as soon as the dragon returned she said to him: 'Where have you been all this time--you must have travelled far?' 'Yes, little mother, I have indeed travelled far", "' answered he", " Then the old woman began to flatter him, and to praise his cleverness; and when she thought she had got him into a good temper, she said: 'I have wondered so often where you get your strength from; I do wish you would tell me", " I would stoop and kiss the place out of pure love!' The dragon laughed at this, and answered: 'In the hearthstone yonder lies the secret of my strength" ,  ' There was once upon a time a King who had no children  Now this King went and laid him down to rest at a place where four roads met, so that every one who passed had to step over him  At last a Fakir came along, and he said to the King, "Man, why are you lying here?" He replied, "Fakir, a thousand men have come and passed by; you pass on too " But the Fakir said, "Who are you, man?" The King replied, "I am a King, Fakir  Of goods and gold I have no lack, but I have lived long and have no children  So I have come here, and have laid me down at the cross-roads  My sins and offences have been very many, so I have come and am lying here that men may pass over me, and perchance my sins may be forgiven me, and God may be merciful, and I may have a son " The Fakir answered him, "Oh King! If you have children, what will you give me?" "Whatever you ask, Fakir," answered the King  The Fakir said, "Of goods and gold I have no lack, but I will say a prayer for you, and you will have two sons; one of those sons will be mine " Then he took out two sweetmeats and handed them to the King, and said, "King! take these two sweetmeats and give them to your wives; give them to the wives you love best " The King took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom  Then the Fakir said, "King! in a year I will return, and of the two sons who will be born to you one is mine and one yours " The King said, "Well, I agree " Then the Fakir went on his way, and the King came home and gave one sweetmeat to each of his two wives  After some time two sons were born to the King  Then what did the King do but place those two sons in an underground room, which he had built in the earth  Some time passed, and one day the Fakir appeared, and said, "King! bring me that son of yours!" What did the King do but bring two slave-girls\' sons and present them to the Fakir', " While the Fakir was sitting there the King's sons were sitting down below in their cellar eating their food", ' Just then a hungry ant had carried away a grain of rice from their food, and was going along with it to her children  Another stronger ant came up and attacked her in order to get this grain of rice  The first ant said, "O ant, why do you drag this away from me? I have long been lame in my feet, and I have got just one grain, and am carrying it to my children  The King\'s sons are sitting in the cellar eating their food; you go and fetch a grain from there; why should you take mine from me?" On this the second ant let go and did not rob the first, but went off to where the King\'s sons were eating their food  On hearing this the Fakir said, "King! these are not your sons; go and bring those children who are eating their food in the cellar " Then the King went and brought his own sons  The Fakir chose the eldest son and took him away, and set off with him on his journey', " When he got home he told the King's son to go out to gather fuel", " So the King's son went out to gather cow-dung, and when he had collected some he brought it in", ' Then the Fakir looked at the King\'s son and put on a great pot, and said, "Come round here, my pupil " But the King\'s son said, "Master first, and pupil after " The Fakir told him to come once, he told him twice, he told him three times, and each time the King\'s son answered, "Master first, and pupil after  Once upon a time a little boy was born to a king who ruled over a great country through which ran a wide river  The king was nearly beside himself with joy, for he had always longed for a son to inherit his crown, and he sent messages to beg all the most powerful fairies to come and see this wonderful baby  In an hour or two, so many were gathered round the cradle, that the child seemed in danger of being smothered; but the king, who was watching the fairies eagerly, was disturbed to see them looking grave', " 'Is there anything the matter?' he asked anxiously", ' The fairies looked at him, and all shook their heads at once', " 'He is a beautiful boy, and it is a great pity; but what IS to happen WILL happen,' said they", " 'It is written in the books of fate that he must die, either by a crocodile, or a serpent, or by a dog", ' If we could save him we would; but that is beyond our power', "' And so saying they vanished", ' For a time the king stood where he was, horror-stricken at what he had heard; but, being of a hopeful nature, he began at once to invent plans to save the prince from the dreadful doom that awaited him', " He instantly sent for his master builder, and bade him construct a strong castle on the top of a mountain, which should be fitted with the most precious things from the king's own palace, and every kind of toy a child could wish to play with", ' And, besides, he gave the strictest orders that a guard should walk round the castle night and day  For four or five years the baby lived in the castle alone with his nurses, taking his airings on the broad terraces, which were surrounded by walls, with a moat beneath them, and only a drawbridge to connect them with the outer world  One day, when the prince was old enough to run quite fast by himself, he looked from the terrace across the moat, and saw a little soft fluffy ball of a dog jumping and playing on the other side', " Now, of course, all dogs had been kept from him for fear that the fairies' prophecy should come true, and he had never even beheld one before", " So he turned to the page who was walking behind him, and said: 'What is that funny little thing which is running so fast over there?' 'That is a dog, prince,' answered the page", " 'Well, bring me one like it, and we will see which can run the faster", "' And he watched the dog till it had disappeared round the corner", ' The page was much puzzled to know what to do  He had strict orders to refuse the prince nothing; yet he remembered the prophecy, and felt that this was a serious matter  At last he thought he had better tell the king the whole story, and let him decide the question', " 'Oh, get him a dog if he wants one,' said the king, 'he will only cry his heart out if he does not have it", "' So a puppy was found, exactly like the other; they might have been twins, and perhaps they were", ' Years went by, and the boy and the dog played together till the boy grew tall and strong', " The time came at last when he sent a message to his father, saying: 'Why do you keep me shut up here, doing nothing? I know all about the prophecy that was made at my birth, but I would far rather be killed at once than live an idle, useless life here", ' So give me arms, and let me go, I pray you; me and my dog too', "' And again the king listened to his wishes, and he and his dog were carried in a ship to the other side of the river, which was so broad here it might almost have been the sea", ' A black horse was waiting for him, tied to a tree, and he mounted and rode away wherever his fancy took him, the dog always at his heels', " Never was any prince so happy as he, and he rode and rode till at length he came to a king's palace", ' The king who lived in it did not care about looking after his country, and seeing that his people lived cheerful and contented lives The weather continued fine for weeks, and the little princess went out every day  So long a period of fine weather had indeed never been known upon that mountain  The only uncomfortable thing was that her nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside; and many an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the weather-cock on the stables  If it had not been for such odd behaviour Irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins  She never forgot Curdie, but him she remembered for his own sake, and indeed would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her debts until they are paid  One splendid sunshiny day, about an hour after noon, Irene, who was playing on a lawn in the garden, heard the distant blast of a bugle  She jumped up with a cry of joy, for she knew by that particular blast that her father was on his way to see her  This part of the garden lay on the slope of the hill and allowed a full view of the country below  So she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked far away to catch the first glimpse of shining armour  In a few moments a little troop came glittering round the shoulder of a hill', " Spears and helmets were sparkling and gleaming, banners were flying, horses prancing, and again came the bugle-blast which was to her like the voice of her father calling across the distance: 'Irene, I'm coming", "' On and on they came until she could clearly distinguish the king", ' He rode a white horse and was taller than any of the men with him  He wore a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet, and as he came still nearer Irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the sun  It was a long time since he had been to see her, and her little heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached, for she loved her king-papa very dearly and was nowhere so happy as in his arms', " When they reached a certain point, after which she could see them no more from the garden, she ran to the gate, and there stood till up they came, clanging and stamping, with one more bright bugle-blast which said: 'Irene, I am come", "' By this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate, but Irene stood alone in front of them", ' When the horsemen pulled up she ran to the side of the white horse and held up her arms  The king stopped and took her hands  In an instant she was on the saddle and clasped in his great strong arms  I wish I could describe the king so that you could see him in your mind  He had gentle, blue eyes, but a nose that made him look like an eagle  A long dark beard, streaked with silvery lines, flowed from his mouth almost to his waist, and as Irene sat on the saddle and hid her glad face upon his bosom it mingled with the golden hair which her mother had given her, and the two together were like a cloud with streaks of the sun woven through it  After he had held her to his heart for a minute he spoke to his white horse, and the great beautiful creature, which had been prancing so proudly a little while before, walked as gently as a lady--for he knew he had a little lady on his back--through the gate and up to the door of the house  Then the king set her on the ground and, dismounting, took her hand and walked with her into the great hall, which was hardly ever entered except when he came to see his little princess  There he sat down, with two of his counsellors who had accompanied him, to have some refreshment, and Irene sat on his right hand and drank her milk out of a wooden bowl curiously carved', " After the king had eaten and drunk he turned to the princess and said, stroking her hair: 'Now, my child, what shall we do next?' This was the question he almost always put to her first after their meal together; and Irene had been waiting for it with some impatience, for now, she thought, she should be able to settle a question which constantly perplexed her", " 'I should like you to take me to see my great old grandmother", "' The king looked grave And said: 'What does my little daughter mean?' 'I mean the Queen Irene that lives up in the tower--the very old lady, you know, with the long hair of silver", "' The king only gazed at his little princess with a look which she could not understand" ,  'When she came to the top, she found herself in a little square place, with three doors, two opposite each other, and one opposite the top of the stair  She stood for a moment, without an idea in her little head what to do next  But as she stood, she began to hear a curious humming sound  Could it be the rain? No  It was much more gentle, and even monotonous than the sound of the rain, which now she scarcely heard  The low sweet humming sound went on, sometimes stopping for a little while and then beginning again  It was more like the hum of a very happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower, than anything else I can think of at this moment  Where could it come from? She laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was there--then to another  When she laid her ear against the third door, there could be no doubt where it came from: it must be from something in that room  What could it be? She was rather afraid, but her curiosity was stronger than her fear, and she opened the door very gently and peeped in  What do you think she saw? A very old lady who sat spinning  Perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady was an old lady, when I inform you that not only was she beautiful, but her skin was smooth and white  I will tell you more  Her hair was combed back from her forehead and face, and hung loose far down and all over her back  That is not much like an old lady--is it? Ah! but it was white almost as snow  And although her face was so smooth, her eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be old  The princess, though she could not have told you why, did think her very old indeed--quite fifty, she said to herself  But she was rather older than that, as you shall hear', " While the princess stared bewildered, with her head just inside the door, the old lady lifted hers, and said, in a sweet, but old and rather shaky voice, which mingled very pleasantly with the continued hum of her wheel: 'Come in, my dear; come in", ' I am glad to see you', "' That the princess was a real princess you might see now quite plainly; for she didn't hang on to the handle of the door, and stare without moving, as I have known some do who ought to have been princesses but were only rather vulgar little girls", ' She did as she was told, stepped inside the door at once, and shut it gently behind her', " 'Come to me, my dear,' said the old lady", ' And again the princess did as she was told  She approached the old lady--rather slowly, I confess--but did not stop until she stood by her side, and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted stars in them', " 'Why, what have you been doing with your eyes, child?' asked the old lady", " 'Crying,' answered the princess", " 'Why, child?' 'Because I couldn't find my way down again", "' 'But you could find your way up", "' 'Not at first--not for a long time" ,  'Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess  He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted  There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones  There was always something about them that was not as it should be  So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess  One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents  Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it  It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate  But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look  The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels  And yet she said that she was a real princess  "Well, we\'ll soon find that out," thought the old queen  But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses  On this the princess had to lie all night  In the morning she was asked how she had slept  "Oh, very badly!" said she  "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night  Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body  It\'s horrible!" Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds  Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that  So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it  There, that is a true story      Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons  When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country, and for many years no one heard anything about him  Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father, who died at last in a good old age, leaving great riches behind him', " For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father's wealth freely, believing that he alone remained to enjoy it", ' But, one day, as he was coming down stairs, he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall, looking about as if the house belonged to him', " 'Have you forgotten me?' asked the man", " 'I can't forget a person I have never known,' was the rude answer", " 'I am your brother,' replied the stranger, 'and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made", ' And, what is worse, they tell me in the village that my father is dead  I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more', "' 'He died six months ago,' said the rich brother, 'and he left you, as your portion, the old wooden chest that stands in the loft", ' You had better go there and look for it; I have no more time to waste', "' And he went his way", ' So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft, which was at the top of the storehouse, and there he found the wooden chest, so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces', " 'What use is this old thing to me?' he said to himself", " 'Oh, well, it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself; so things might be worse after all", "' Placing the chest on his back, the man, whose name was Jose, set out for his inn, and, borrowing a hatchet, began to chop up the box", ' In doing so he discovered a secret drawer, and in it lay a paper  He opened the paper, not knowing what it might contain, and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father  Putting the precious writing in his pocket, he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside, and he ran out at once in search of him  The debtor proved to be an old miser, who lived at the other end of the village  He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed, and, indeed, when he saw it, was very unwilling to pay what he owed  However, the stranger threatened to drag him before the king, and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one  The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket, and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man  A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town, when he met a poor woman crying bitterly  He stopped and asked her what was the matter, and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying, and, to make matters worse, a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison', " 'Comfort yourself,' said the stranger kindly; 'they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods", ' I will not only pay his debts but, if he dies, the cost of his burial also  And now go home, and nurse him as well as you can', "' And so she did; but, in spite of her care, the husband died, and was buried by the stranger" ,  ' There were once a king and a queen who lived in a beautiful castle, and had a large, and fair, and rich, and happy land to rule over  From the very first they loved each other greatly, and lived very happily together, but they had no heir  They had been married for seven years, but had neither son nor daughter, and that was a great grief to both of them  More than once it happened that when the king was in a bad temper, he let it out on the poor queen, and said that here they were now, getting old, and neither they nor the kingdom had an heir, and it was all her fault  This was hard to listen to, and she went and cried and vexed herself', " Finally, the king said to her one day, 'This can't be borne any longer", " I go about childless, and it's your fault", ' I am going on a journey and shall be away for a year  If you have a child when I come back again, all will be well, and I shall love you beyond all measure, and never more say an angry word to you  But if the nest is just as empty when I come home, then I must part with you', "' After the king had set out on his journey, the queen went about in her loneliness, and sorrowed and vexed herself more than ever", " At last her maid said to her one day, 'I think that some help could be found, if your majesty would seek it", "' Then she told about a wise old woman in that country, who had helped many in troubles of the same kind, and could no doubt help the queen as well, if she would send for her", ' The queen did so, and the wise woman came, and to her she confided her sorrow, that she, was childless, and the king and his kingdom had no heir  The wise woman knew help for this', " 'Out in the king's garden,' said she, 'under the great oak that stands on the left hand, just as one goes out from the castle, is a little bush, rather brown than green, with hairy leaves and long spikes", ' On that bush there are just at this moment three buds  If your majesty goes out there alone, fasting, before sunrise, and takes the middle one of the three buds, and eats it, then in six months you will bring a princess into the world  As soon as she is born, she must have a nurse, whom I shall provide, and this nurse must live with the child in a secluded part of the palace; no other person must visit the child; neither the king nor the queen must see it until it is fourteen years old, for that would cause great sorrow and misfortune', "' The queen rewarded the old woman richly, and next morning, before the sun rose, she was down in the garden, found at once the little bush with the three buds, plucked the middle one and ate it", ' It was sweet to taste, but afterwards was as bitter as gall  Six months after this, she brought into the world a little girl  There was a nurse in readiness, whom the wise woman had provided, and preparations were made for her living with the child, quite alone, in a secluded wing of the castle, looking out on the pleasure-park  The queen did as the wise woman had told her; she gave up the child immediately, and the nurse took it and lived with it there  When the king came home and heard that a daughter had been born to him, he was of course very pleased and happy, and wanted to see her at once  The queen had then to tell him this much of the story, that it had been foretold that it would cause great sorrow and misfortune if either he or she got a sight of the child until it had completed its fourteenth year  This was a long time to wait  The king longed so much to get a sight of his daughter, and the queen no less than he, but she knew that it was not like other children, for it could speak immediately after it was born, and was as wise as older folk  This the nurse had told her, for with her the queen had a talk now and again, but there was no one who had ever seen the princess  The queen had also seen what the wise woman could do, so she insisted strongly that her warning should be obeyed  When she woke the next morning, the first thing she heard was the rain still falling  Indeed, this day was so like the last that it would have been difficult to tell where was the use of It  The first thing she thought of, however, was not the rain, but the lady in the tower; and the first question that occupied her thoughts was whether she should not ask the nurse to fulfil her promise this very morning, and go with her to find her grandmother as soon as she had had her breakfast', " But she came to the conclusion that perhaps the lady would not be pleased if she took anyone to see her without first asking leave; especially as it was pretty evident, seeing she lived on pigeons' eggs, and cooked them herself, that she did not want the household to know she was there", ' So the princess resolved to take the first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might bring her nurse  She believed the fact that she could not otherwise convince her she was telling the truth would have much weight with her grandmother  The princess and her nurse were the best of friends all dressing-time, and the princess in consequence ate an enormous little breakfast', " 'I wonder, Lootie'--that was her pet name for her nurse--'what pigeons' eggs taste like?' she said, as she was eating her egg--not quite a common one, for they always picked out the pinky ones for her", " 'We'll get you a pigeon's egg, and you shall judge for yourself,' said the nurse", " 'Oh, no, no!' returned Irene, suddenly reflecting they might disturb the old lady in getting it, and that even if they did not, she would have one less in consequence", " 'What a strange creature you are,' said the nurse--'first to want a thing and then to refuse it!' But she did not say it crossly, and the princess never minded any remarks that were not unfriendly", " 'Well, you see, Lootie, there are reasons,' she returned, and said no more, for she did not want to bring up the subject of their former strife, lest her nurse should offer to go before she had had her grandmother's permission to bring her", ' Of course she could refuse to take her, but then she would believe her less than ever  Now the nurse, as she said herself afterwards, could not be every moment in the room; and as never before yesterday had the princess given her the smallest reason for anxiety, it had not yet come into her head to watch her more closely  So she soon gave her a chance, and, the very first that offered, Irene was off and up the stairs again', " This day's adventure, however, did not turn out like yesterday's, although it began like it; and indeed to-day is very seldom like yesterday, if people would note the differences--even when it rains", ' The princess ran through passage after passage, and could not find the stair of the tower  My own suspicion is that she had not gone up high enough, and was searching on the second instead of the third floor  When she turned to go back, she failed equally in her search after the stair  She was lost once more  Something made it even worse to bear this time, and it was no wonder that she cried again', " Suddenly it occurred to her that it was after having cried before that she had found her grandmother's stair", ' She got up at once, wiped her eyes, and started upon a fresh quest  This time, although she did not find what she hoped, she found what was next best: she did not come on a stair that went up, but she came upon one that went down  It was evidently not the stair she had come up, yet it was a good deal better than none; so down she went, and was singing merrily before she reached the bottom  There, to her surprise, she found herself in the kitchen  Although she was not allowed to go there alone, her nurse had often taken her, and she was a great favourite with the servants', " So there was a general rush at her the moment she appeared, for every one wanted to have her; and the report of where she was soon reached the nurse's ears", ' She came at once to fetch her; but she never suspected how she had got there, and the princess kept her own counsel  Her failure to find the old lady not only disappointed her, but made her very thoughtful I have said the Princess Irene was about eight years old when my story begins  And this is how it begins  One very wet day, when the mountain was covered with mist which was constantly gathering itself together into raindrops, and pouring down on the roofs of the great old house, whence it fell in a fringe of water from the eaves all round about it, the princess could not of course go out  She got very tired, so tired that even her toys could no longer amuse her  You would wonder at that if I had time to describe to you one half of the toys she had', " But then, you wouldn't have the toys themselves, and that makes all the difference: you can't get tired of a thing before you have it", ' It was a picture, though, worth seeing--the princess sitting in the nursery with the sky ceiling over her head, at a great table covered with her toys  If the artist would like to draw this, I should advise him not to meddle with the toys  I am afraid of attempting to describe them, and I think he had better not try to draw them  He had better not', " He can do a thousand things I can't, but I don't think he could draw those toys", ' No man could better make the princess herself than he could, though--leaning with her back bowed into the back of the chair, her head hanging down, and her hands in her lap, very miserable as she would say herself, not even knowing what she would like, except it were to go out and get thoroughly wet, and catch a particularly nice cold, and have to go to bed and take gruel  The next moment after you see her sitting there, her nurse goes out of the room  Even that is a change, and the princess wakes up a little, and looks about her  Then she tumbles off her chair and runs out of the door, not the same door the nurse went out of, but one which opened at the foot of a curious old stair of worm-eaten oak, which looked as if never anyone had set foot upon it  She had once before been up six steps, and that was sufficient reason, in such a day, for trying to find out what was at the top of it  Up and up she ran--such a long way it seemed to her!--until she came to the top of the third flight  There she found the landing was the end of a long passage  Into this she ran  It was full of doors on each side  There were so many that she did not care to open any, but ran on to the end, where she turned into another passage, also full of doors  When she had turned twice more, and still saw doors and only doors about her, she began to get frightened  It was so silent! And all those doors must hide rooms with nobody in them! That was dreadful  Also the rain made a great trampling noise on the roof  She turned and started at full speed, her little footsteps echoing through the sounds of the rain--back for the stairs and her safe nursery  So she thought, but she had lost herself long ago', " It doesn't follow that she was lost, because she had lost herself, though", ' She ran for some distance, turned several times, and then began to be afraid  Very soon she was sure that she had lost the way back  Rooms everywhere, and no stair! Her little heart beat as fast as her little feet ran, and a lump of tears was growing in her throat' ,  " ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen whose children had all died, first one and then another, until at last only one little daughter remained, and the Queen was at her wits' end to know where to find a really good nurse who would take care of her, and bring her up", ' A herald was sent who blew a trumpet at every street corner, and commanded all the best nurses to appear before the Queen, that she might choose one for the little Princess  So on the appointed day the whole palace was crowded with nurses, who came from the four corners of the world to offer themselves, until the Queen declared that if she was ever to see the half of them, they must be brought out to her, one by one, as she sat in a shady wood near the palace  This was accordingly done, and the nurses, after they had made their curtsey to the King and Queen, ranged themselves in a line before her that she might choose  Most of them were fair and fat and charming, but there was one who was dark-skinned and ugly, and spoke a strange language which nobody could understand  The Queen wondered how she dared offer herself, and she was told to go away, as she certainly would not do  Upon which she muttered something and passed on, but hid herself in a hollow tree, from which she could see all that happened  The Queen, without giving her another thought, chose a pretty rosy-faced nurse, but no sooner was her choice made than a snake, which was hidden in the grass, bit that very nurse on her foot, so that she fell down as if dead  The Queen was very much vexed by this accident, but she soon selected another, who was just stepping forward when an eagle flew by and dropped a large tortoise upon her head, which was cracked in pieces like an egg-shell  At this the Queen was much horrified; nevertheless, she chose a third time, but with no better fortune, for the nurse, moving quickly, ran into the branch of a tree and blinded herself with a thorn  Then the Queen in dismay cried that there must be some malignant influence at work, and that she would choose no more that day; and she had just risen to return to the palace when she heard peals of malicious laughter behind her, and turning round saw the ugly stranger whom she had dismissed, who was making very merry over the disasters and mocking everyone, but especially the Queen  This annoyed Her Majesty very much, and she was about to order that she should be arrested, when the witch--for she was a witch--with two blows from a wand summoned a chariot of fire drawn by winged dragons, and was whirled off through the air uttering threats and cries', " When the King saw this he cried: 'Alas! now we are ruined indeed, for that was no other than the Fairy Carabosse, who has had a grudge against me ever since I was a boy and put sulphur into her porridge one day for fun", "' Then the Queen began to cry", " 'If I had only known who it was,' she said, 'I would have done my best to make friends with her; now I suppose all is lost", "' The King was sorry to have frightened her so much, and proposed that they should go and hold a council as to what was best to be done to avert the misfortunes which Carabosse certainly meant to bring upon the little Princess", ' So all the counsellors were summoned to the palace, and when they had shut every door and window, and stuffed up every keyhole that they might not be overheard, they talked the affair over, and decided that every fairy for a thousand leagues round should be invited to the christening of the Princess, and that the time of the ceremony should be kept a profound secret, in case the Fairy Carabosse should take it into her head to attend it  The Queen and her ladies set to work to prepare presents for the fairies who were invited: for each one a blue velvet cloak, a petticoat of apricot satin, a pair of high-heeled shoes, some sharp needles, and a pair of golden scissors  Of all the fairies the Queen knew, only five were able to come on the day appointed, but they began immediately to bestow gifts upon the Princess', " One promised that she should be perfectly beautiful, the second that she should understand anything--no matter what--the first time it was explained to her, the third that she should sing like a nightingale, the fourth that she should succeed in everything she undertook, and the fifth was opening her mouth to speak when a tremendous rumbling was heard in the chimney, and Carabosse, all covered with soot, came rolling down, crying: 'I say that she shall be the unluckiest of the unlucky until she is twenty years old", "' Then the Queen and all the fairies began to beg and beseech her to think better of it, and not be so unkind to the poor little Princess, who had never done her any harm", ' But the ugly old Fairy only grunted and made no answer  So the last Fairy, who had not yet given her gift, tried to mend matters by promising the Princess a long and happy life after the fatal time was over  At this Carabosse laughed maliciously, and climbed away up the chimney, leaving them all in great consternation, and especially the Queen  However, she entertained the fairies splendidly, and gave them beautiful ribbons, of which they are very fond, in addition to the other presents  When they were going away the oldest Fairy said that they were of opinion that it would be best to shut the Princess up in some place, with her waiting-women, so that she might not see anyone else until she was twenty years old  So the King had a tower built on purpose  It had no windows, so it was lighted with wax candles, and the only way into it was by an underground passage, which had iron doors only twenty feet apart, and guards were posted everywhere  The Princess had been named Mayblossom, because she was as fresh and blooming as Spring itself, and she grew up tall and beautiful, and everything she did and said was charming  Every time the King and Queen came to see her they were more delighted with her than before, but though she was weary of the tower, and often begged them to take her away from it, they always refused  Princess Solima was sick, not exactly ill, but so much out of sorts that her father, King Zuliman, was both annoyed and perturbed  The princess was as beautiful as a princess of those days should be; her long tresses were like threads of gold, her blue eyes rivaled the color of the sky on the balmiest summer day; and her smile was as radiant as the sunshine itself  She was learned and clever, too, and her goodness of heart gained for her as great a renown as her peerless beauty  Despite all this, Princess Solima was not happy  Indeed, she was wretched to despondency, and her melancholy weighed heavily upon her father  "What ails you, my precious daughter?" he asked her a hundred times, but she made no answer  She just sat and silently moped  She did not waste away, which puzzled the physicians; she did not grow pale, which surprised her attendants; and she did not weep, which astonished herself  But she felt as if her heart had grown heavy, as if there was no use in anything  The king squared his shoulders to show his determination and summoned his magicians and wizards and sorcerers and commanded them to perform their arts and solve the mystery of the illness of Princess Solima  A strange crew they were, ranged in a semi-circle before the king  There was the renowned astrologer from Egypt, a little man with a humpback; the mixer of mysterious potions from China, a long, lank yellow man, with tiny eyes; the alchemist from Arabia, a scowling man with his face almost concealed by whiskers; there was a Greek and a Persian and a Phoenician, each with some special knowledge and fearfully anxious to display it  They set to work', " One studied the stars, another concocted a sweet-smelling fluid, a third retired to the woods and thought deeply, a fourth made abstruse calculations with diagrams and figures, a fifth questioned the princess' handmaidens, and a sixth conceived the brilliant notion of talking with the princess herself", ' He was certainly an original wizard, and he learned more than all the others  Then they met in consultation and talked foreign languages and pretended very seriously to understand one another  One said the stars were in opposition, another said he had gazed into a crystal and had seen a glow-worm chasing a hippopotamus which a third interpreted as meaning the princess would die if the glow-worm won the race  "Rubbish!" exclaimed the magician who had spoken to the princess; "likewise stuff and nonsense and the equivalent thereof in the seventy unknown languages " That was an impertinent comment on their divinations, and so they listened seriously  "The princess," he said, "is just tired  That is a disease which will become popular and fashionable as the world grows older and more people amass riches  She is sick of being waited on hand and foot and bowed down to and all that sort of thing  She has never been allowed to romp as a child, to choose her own companions and the rest of it  Therefore, she is bored with all the etcetras  The case is comprehensible and comprehensive: it needs the exercise of imagination stimulated by prescience, conscience, patience    " The others yawned and began to collect dictionaries, and fearing that they might be tempted to fling them at him after they had found the meaning of his big words, he ceased  "I agree," said the president of the assembly, the oldest wizard, "only I diagnose the disease in simpler form  Once upon a time there was a man who had a meadow which lay on the side of a mountain, and in the meadow there was a barn in which he stored hay  But there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years, for every St', " John's eve, when the grass was in the height of its vigor, it was all eaten clean up, just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed it down to the ground during the night", ' This happened once, and it happened twice, but then the man got tired of losing his crop, and said to his sons--he had three of them, and the third was called Cinderlad--that one of them must go and sleep in the barn on St', " John's night, for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again, blade and stalk, as it had been the last two years, and the one who went to watch must keep a sharp look-out, the man said", ' The eldest was quite willing to go to the meadow; he would watch the grass, he said, and he would do it so well that neither man, nor beast, nor even the devil himself should have any of it  So when evening came he went to the barn, and lay down to sleep, but when night was drawing near there was such a rumbling and such an earthquake that the walls and roof shook again, and the lad jumped up and took to his heels as fast as he could, and never even looked back, and the barn remained empty that year just as it had been for the last two  Next St', " John's eve the man again said that he could not go on in this way, losing all the grass in the outlying field year after year, and that one of his sons must just go there and watch it, and watch well too", ' So the next oldest son was willing to show what he could do  He went to the barn and lay down to sleep, as his brother had done; but when night was drawing near there was a great rumbling, and then an earthquake, which was even worse than that on the former St', " John's night, and when the youth heard it he was terrified, and went off, running as if for a wager", " The year after, it was Cinderlad's turn, but when he made ready to go the others laughed at him, and mocked him", ' "Well, you are just the right one to watch the hay, you who have never learned anything but how to sit among the ashes and bake yourself!" said they  Cinderlad, however, did not trouble himself about what they said, but when evening drew near rambled away to the outlying field', " When he got there he went into the barn and lay down, but in about an hour's time the rumbling and creaking began, and it was frightful to hear it", ' "Well, if it gets no worse than that, I can manage to stand it," thought Cinderlad  In a little time the creaking began again, and the earth quaked so that all the hay flew about the boy  "Oh! if it gets no worse than that I can manage to stand it," thought Cinderlad  But then came a third rumbling, and a third earthquake, so violent that the boy thought the walls and roof had fallen down, but when that was over everything suddenly grew as still as death around him  "I am pretty sure that it will come again," thought Cinderlad; but no, it did not  Everything was quiet, and everything stayed quiet, and when he had lain still a short time he heard something that sounded as if a horse were standing chewing just outside the barn door  He stole away to the door, which was ajar, to see what was there, and a horse was standing eating  It was so big, and fat, and fine a horse that Cinderlad had never seen one like it before, and a saddle and bridle lay upon it, and a complete suit of armor for a knight, and everything was of copper, and so bright that it shone again  "Ha, ha! it is thou who eatest up our hay then," thought the boy; "but I will stop that " So he made haste, and took out his steel for striking fire, and threw it over the horse, and then it had no power to stir from the spot, and became so tame that the boy could do what he liked with it  So he mounted it and rode away to a place which no one knew of but himself, and there he tied it up  When he went home again his brothers laughed and asked how he had got on  "You didn\'t lie long in the barn, if even you have been so far as the field!" said they  "I lay in the barn till the sun rose, but I saw nothing and heard nothing, not I," said the boy  Once there was a king who had great riches, which, when he died, he divided among his three sons', " The two eldest of these lived in rioting and feasting, and thus wasted and squandered their father's wealth till nothing remained, and they found themselves in want and misery", ' The youngest of the three sons, on the contrary, made good use of his portion  He married a wife and soon they had a most beautiful daughter, for whom, when she was grown up, he caused a great palace to be built underground, and then killed the architect who had built it', " Next he shut up his daughter inside, and then sent heralds all over the world to make known that he who should find the king's daughter should have her to wife", ' If he were not capable of finding her then he must die  Many young men sought to discover her, but all perished in the attempt  After many had met their death thus, there came a young man, beautiful to behold, and as clever as he was beautiful, who had a great desire to attempt the enterprise  First he went to a herdsman, and begged him to hide him in a sheepskin, which had a golden fleece, and in this disguise to take him to the king  The shepherd let himself be persuaded so to do, took a skin having a golden fleece, sewed the young man in it, putting in also food and drink, and so brought him before the king', " When the latter saw the golden lamb, he asked the herd: 'Will you sell me this lamb?' But the herd answered: 'No, oh king; I will not sell it; but if you find pleasure therein, I will be willing to oblige you, and I will lend it to you, free of charge, for three days, after that you must give it back to me", "' This the king agreed to do, and he arose and took the lamb to his daughter", ' When he had led it into her palace, and through many rooms, he came to a shut door', " Then he called 'Open, Sartara Martara of the earth!' and the door opened of itself", ' After that they went through many more rooms, and came to another closed door', " Again the king called out: 'Open, Sartara Martara of the earth!' and this door opened like the other, and they came into the apartment where the princess dwelt, the floor, walls, and roof of which were all of silver", ' When the king had embraced the princess, he gave her the lamb, to her great joy  She stroked it, caressed it, and played with it', " After a while the lamb got loose, which, when the princess saw, she said: 'See, father, the lamb is free", "' But the king answered: 'It is only a lamb, why should it not be free?' Then he left the lamb with the princess, and went his way", ' In the night, however, the young man threw off the skin', " When the princess saw how beautiful he was, she fell in love with him, and asked him: 'Why did you come here disguised in a sheepskin like that?' Then he answered: 'When I saw how many people sought you, and could not find you, and lost their lives in so doing, I invented this trick, and so I am come safely to you", '\' The princess exclaimed: \'You have done well so to do; but you must know that your wager is not yet won, for my father will change me and my maidens into ducks, and will ask you, "Which of these ducks is the princess?" Then I will turn my head back, and with my bill will clean my wings, so that you may know me', "' When they had spent three days together, chatting and caressing one another, the herd came back to the king, and demanded his lamb", ' Then the king went to his daughter to bring it away, which troubled the princess very much, for she said they had played so nicely together', " But the king said: 'I cannot leave it with you, my daughter, for it is only lent to me", "' So he took it away with him, and gave it back to the shepherd", " Then the young man threw the skin from off him, and went to the king, saying: 'Sire, I am persuaded I can find your daughter", "' When the king saw how handsome he was, he said: 'My lad, I have pity on your youth", ' This enterprise has already cost the lives of many, and will certainly be your death as well  There was once a king who had only one son, and this young man tormented his father from morning till night to allow him to travel in far countries', " For a long time the king refused to give him leave; but at last, wearied out, he granted permission, and ordered his treasurer to produce a large sum of money for the prince's expenses", ' The youth was overjoyed at the thought that he was really going to see the world, and after tenderly embracing his father he set forth  He rode on for some weeks without meeting with any adventures; but one night when he was resting at an inn, he came across another traveller, with whom he fell into conversation, in the course of which the stranger inquired if he never played cards  The young man replied that he was very fond of doing so  Cards were brought, and in a very short time the prince had lost every penny he possessed to his new acquaintance  When there was absolutely nothing left at the bottom of the bag, the stranger proposed that they should have just one more game, and that if the prince won he should have the money restored to him, but in case he lost, should remain in the inn for three years, and besides that should be his servant for another three  The prince agreed to those terms, played, and lost; so the stranger took rooms for him, and furnished him with bread and water every day for three years  The prince lamented his lot, but it was no use; and at the end of three years he was released and had to go to the house of the stranger, who was really the king of a neighbouring country, and be his servant  Before he had gone very far he met a woman carrying a child, which was crying from hunger  The prince took it from her, and fed it with his last crust of bread and last drop of water, and then gave it back to its mother', " The woman thanked him gratefully, and said: 'Listen, my lord", ' You must walk straight on till you notice a very strong scent, which comes from a garden by the side of the road  Go in and hide yourself close to a tank, where three doves will come to bathe  As the last one flies past you, catch hold of its robe of feathers, and refuse to give it back till the dove has promised you three things', "' The young man did as he was told, and everything happened as the woman had said", ' He took the robe of feathers from the dove, who gave him in exchange for it a ring, a collar, and one of its own plumes, saying: \'When you are in any trouble, cry "Come to my aid, O dove!" I am the daughter of the king you are going to serve, who hates your father and made you gamble in order to cause your ruin', "' Thus the prince went on his way, and in course of time he arrived at the king's palace", " As soon as his master knew he was there, the young man was sent for into his presence, and three bags were handed to him with these words: 'Take this wheat, this millet, and this barley, and sow them at once, so that I may have loaves of them all to-morrow", "' The prince stood speechless at this command, but the king did not condescend to give any further explanation, and when he was dismissed the young man flew to the room which had been set aside for him, and pulling out his feather, he cried: 'Dove, dove! be quick and come", "' 'What is it?' said the dove, flying in through the open window, and the prince told her of the task before him, and of his despair at being unable to accomplish it", " 'Fear nothing; it will be all right,' replied the dove, as she flew away again", ' The next morning when the prince awoke he saw the three loaves standing beside his bed', " He jumped up and dressed, and he was scarcely ready when a page arrived with the message that he was to go at once into the king's chamber", ' Taking the loaves in his arm he followed the boy, and, bowing low, laid them down before the king', " The monarch looked at the loaves for a moment without speaking, then he said: 'Good", ' The man who can do this can also find the ring which my eldest daughter dropped into the sea', "' The prince hastened back to his room and summoned the dove, and when she heard this new command she said: 'Now listen", ' To-morrow take a knife and a basin and go down to the shore and get into a boat you will find there', "' The young man did not know what he was to do when he was in the boat or where he was to go, but as the dove had come to his rescue before, he was ready to obey her blindly" ,  ' Once upon a time, in the very middle of the middle of a large kingdom, there was a town, and in the town a palace, and in the palace a king  This king had one son whom his father thought was wiser and cleverer than any son ever was before, and indeed his father had spared no pains to make him so  He had been very careful in choosing his tutors and governors when he was a boy, and when he became a youth he sent him to travel, so that he might see the ways of other people, and find that they were often as good as his own  It was now a year since the prince had returned home, for his father felt that it was time that his son should learn how to rule the kingdom which would one day be his  But during his long absence the prince seemed to have changed his character altogether  From being a merry and light-hearted boy, he had grown into a gloomy and thoughtful man  The king knew of nothing that could have produced such an alteration', " He vexed himself about it from morning till night, till at length an explanation occurred to him--the young man was in love! Now the prince never talked about his feelings--for the matter of that he scarcely talked at all; and the father knew that if he was to come to the bottom of the prince's dismal face, he would have to begin", ' So one day, after dinner, he took his son by the arm and led him into another room, hung entirely with the pictures of beautiful maidens, each one more lovely than the other', " 'My dear boy,' he said, 'you are very sad; perhaps after all your wanderings it is dull for you here all alone with me", ' It would be much better if you would marry, and I have collected here the portraits of the most beautiful women in the world of a rank equal to your own  Choose which among them you would like for a wife, and I will send an embassy to her father to ask for her hand', "' 'Alas! your Majesty,' answered the prince, 'it is not love or marriage that makes me so gloomy; but the thought, which haunts me day and night, that all men, even kings, must die", ' Never shall I be happy again till I have found a kingdom where death is unknown  And I have determined to give myself no rest till I have discovered the Land of Immortality  The old king heard him with dismay; things were worse than he thought  He tried to reason with his son, and told him that during all these years he had been looking forward to his return, in order to resign his throne and its cares, which pressed so heavily upon him  But it was in vain that he talked; the prince would listen to nothing, and the following morning buckled on his sword and set forth on his journey  He had been travelling for many days, and had left his fatherland behind him, when close to the road he came upon a huge tree, and on its topmost bough an eagle was sitting shaking the branches with all his might  This seemed so strange and so unlike an eagle, that the prince stood still with surprise, and the bird saw him and flew to the ground  The moment its feet touched the ground he changed into a king', " 'Why do you look so astonished?' he asked", " 'I was wondering why you shook the boughs so fiercely,' answered the prince", " 'I am condemned to do this, for neither I nor any of my kindred can die till I have rooted up this great tree,' replied the king of the eagles", " 'But it is now evening, and I need work no more to-day", ' Come to my house with me, and be my guest for the night', "' The prince accepted gratefully the eagle's invitation, for he was tired and hungry", " They were received at the palace by the king's beautiful daughter, who gave orders that dinner should be laid for them at once", " While they were eating, the eagle questioned his guest about his travels, and if he was wandering for pleasure's sake, or with any special aim", ' Then the prince told him everything, and how he could never turn back till he had discovered the Land of Immortality In the fresh morning dawn, in the rosy air gleams a great Star, the brightest Star of the morning  His rays tremble on the white wall, as if he wished to write down on it what he can tell, what he has seen there and elsewhere during thousands of years in our rolling world  Let us hear one of his stories  "A short time ago"--the Star\'s "short time ago" is called among men "centuries ago"--"my rays followed a young artist  It was in the city of the Popes, in the world-city, Rome  Much has been changed there in the course of time, but the changes have not come so quickly as the change from youth to old age  Then already the palace of the Caesars was a ruin, as it is now; fig trees and laurels grew among the fallen marble columns, and in the desolate bathing-halls, where the gilding still clings to the wall; the Coliseum was a gigantic ruin; the church bells sounded, the incense sent up its fragrant cloud, and through the streets marched processions with flaming tapers and glowing canopies  Holy Church was there, and art was held as a high and holy thing  In Rome lived the greatest painter in the world, Raphael; there also dwelt the first of sculptors, Michael Angelo  Even the Pope paid homage to these two, and honored them with a visit  Art was recognized and honored, and was rewarded also  But, for all that, everything great and splendid was not seen and known  "In a narrow lane stood an old house  Once it had been a temple; a young sculptor now dwelt there  He was young and quite unknown  He certainly had friends, young artists, like himself, young in spirit, young in hopes and thoughts; they told him he was rich in talent, and an artist, but that he was foolish for having no faith in his own power; for he always broke what he had fashioned out of clay, and never completed anything; and a work must be completed if it is to be seen and to bring money  "\'You are a dreamer,\' they went on to say to him, \'and that\'s your misfortune  But the reason of this is, that you have never lived, you have never tasted life, you have never enjoyed it in great wholesome draughts, as it ought to be enjoyed', " In youth one must mingle one's own personality with life, that they may become one", ' Look at the great master Raphael, whom the Pope honors and the world admires', " He's no despiser of wine and bread", '\' "\'And he even appreciates the baker\'s daughter, the pretty Fornarina,\' added Angelo, one of the merriest of the young friends  "Yes, they said a good many things of the kind, according to their age and their reason  They wanted to draw the young artist out with them into the merry wild life, the mad life as it might also be called; and at certain times he felt an inclination for it', " He had warm blood, a strong imagination, and could take part in the merry chat, and laugh aloud with the rest; but what they called 'Raphael's merry life' disappeared before him like a vapor when he saw the divine radiance that beamed forth from the pictures of the great master; and when he stood in the Vatican, before the forms of beauty which the masters had hewn out of marble thousands of years since, his breast swelled, and he felt within himself something high, something holy, something elevating, great and good, and he wished that he could produce similar forms from the blocks of marble", ' He wished to make a picture of that which was within him, stirring upward from his heart to the realms of the Infinite; but how, and in what form? The soft clay was fashioned under his fingers into forms of beauty, but the next day he broke what he had fashioned, according to his wont  "One day he walked past one of those rich palaces of which Rome has many to show  He stopped before the great open portal, and beheld a garden surrounded by cloistered walks  The garden bloomed with a goodly show of the fairest roses  Great white lilies with green juicy leaves shot upward from the marble basin in which the clear water was splashing; and a form glided past, the daughter of the princely house, graceful, delicate, and wonderfully fair  On board a steamer I once met an elderly man, with such a merry face that, if it was really an index of his mind, he must have been the happiest fellow in creation; and indeed he considered himself so, for I heard it from his own mouth  He was a Dane, the owner of a travelling theatre  He had all his company with him in a large box, for he was the proprietor of a puppet-show  His inborn cheerfulness, he said, had been tested by a member of the Polytechnic Institution, and the experiment had made him completely happy  I did not at first understand all this, but afterwards he explained the whole story to me; and here it is:-- "I was giving a representation," he said, "in the hall of the posting-house in the little town of Slagelse; there was a splendid audience, entirely juvenile excepting two respectable matrons  All at once, a person in black, of student-like appearance, entered the room, and sat down; he laughed aloud at the telling points, and applauded quite at the proper time  This was a very unusual spectator for me, and I felt anxious to know who he was  I heard that he was a member of the Polytechnic Institution in Copenhagen, who had been sent out to lecture to the people in the provinces', " Punctually at eight o'clock my performance closed, for children must go early to bed, and a manager must also consult the convenience of the public", ' "At nine o\'clock the lecturer commenced his lecture and his experiments, and then I formed a part of his audience  It was wonderful both to hear and to see  The greater part of it was beyond my comprehension, but it led me to think that if we men can acquire so much, we must surely be intended to last longer than the little span which extends only to the time when we are hidden away under the earth  His experiments were quite miracles on a small scale, and yet the explanations flowed as naturally as water from his lips  At the time of Moses and the prophets, such a man would have been placed among the sages of the land; in the middle ages they would have burnt him at the stake  "All night long I could not sleep; and the next evening when I gave another performance and the lecturer was present, I was in one of my best moods  "I once heard of an actor, who, when he had to act the part of a lover, always thought of one particular lady in the audience; he only played for her, and forgot all the rest of the house, and now the Polytechnic lecturer was my she, my only auditor, for whom alone I played  "When the performance was over, and the puppets removed behind the curtain, the Polytechnic lecturer invited me into his room to take a glass of wine  He talked of my comedies, and I of his science, and I believe we were both equally pleased  But I had the best of it, for there was much in what he did that he could not always explain to me  For instance, why a piece of iron which is rubbed on a cylinder, should become magnetic  How does this happen? The magnetic sparks come to it,--but how? It is the same with people in the world; they are rubbed about on this spherical globe till the electric spark comes upon them, and then we have a Napoleon, or a Luther, or some one of the kind  "\'The whole world is but a series of miracles,\' said the lecturer, \'but we are so accustomed to them that we call them everyday matters', "' And he went on explaining things to me till my skull seemed lifted from my brain, and I declared that were I not such an old fellow, I would at once become a member of the Polytechnic Institution, that I might learn to look at the bright side of everything, although I was one of the happiest of men", ' "\'One of the happiest!\' said the lecturer, as if the idea pleased him; \'are you really happy?\' "\'Yes,\' I replied; \'for I am welcomed in every town, when I arrive with my company; but I certainly have one wish which sometimes weighs upon my cheerful temper like a mountain of lead  I should like to become the manager of a real theatre, and the director of a real troupe of men and women \' "\'I understand,\' he said; \'you would like to have life breathed into your puppets, so that they might be living actors, and you their director  And would you then be quite happy?\' "I said I believed so  But he did not; and we talked it over in all manner of ways, yet could not agree on the subject  However, the wine was excellent, and we clanked our glasses together as we drank  There must have been magic in it, or I should most certainly become tipsy; but that did not happen, for my mind seemed quite clear; and, indeed, a kind of sunshine filled the room, and beamed from the eyes of the Polytechnic lecturer  Now, it chanced at one time during the chase, while they were hunting over the plain of Cliach, that Finn went to rest on the hill of Collkilla, which is now called Knockainy; and he had his hunting-tents pitched on a level spot near the summit, and some of his chief heroes tarried with him  When the King and his companions had taken their places on the hill, the Feni unleashed their gracefully shaped, sweet-voiced hounds through the woods and sloping glens', " And it was sweet music to Finn's ear, the cry of the long-snouted dogs, as they routed the deer from their covers and the badgers from their dens; the pleasant, emulating shouts of the youths; the whistling and signalling of the huntsmen; and the encouraging cheers of the mighty heroes, as they spread themselves through the glens and woods, and over the broad green plain of Cliach", ' Then did Finn ask who of all his companions would go to the highest point of the hill directly over them to keep watch and ward and to report how the chase went on  For, he said, the Dedannans were ever on the watch to work the Feni mischief by their druidical spells, and more so during the chase than at other times  Finn Ban Mac Bresal stood forward and offered to go; and, grasping his broad spears, he went to the top, and sat viewing the plain to the four points of the sky  And the King and his companions brought forth the chess-board and chess-men and sat them down to a game  Finn Ban Mac Bresal had been watching only a little time when he saw on a plain to the east a Fomor of vast size coming towards the hill, leading a horse  As he came nearer Finn Ban observed that he was the ugliest-looking giant his eyes ever lighted on  He had a large, thick body, bloated and swollen out to a great size; clumsy, crooked legs; and broad, flat feet turned inwards  His hands and arms and shoulders were bony and thick and very strong-looking; his neck was long and thin; and while his head was poked forward, his face was turned up, as he stared straight at Finn Mac Bresal  He had thick lips, and long, crooked teeth; and his face was covered all over with bushy hair  He was fully armed; but all his weapons were rusty and soiled and slovenly looking  A broad shield of a dirty, sooty colour, rough and battered, hung over his back; he had a long, heavy, straight sword at his left hip; and he held in his left hand two thick-handled, broad-headed spears, old and rusty, and seeming as if they had not been handled for years  In his right hand he held an iron club, which he dragged after him with its end on the ground; and, as it trailed along, it tore up a track as deep as the furrow a farmer ploughs with a team of oxen  The horse he led was even larger in proportion than the giant himself, and quite as ugly  His great carcass was covered all over with tangled scraggy hair, of a sooty black; you could count his ribs and all the points of his big bones through his hide; his legs were crooked and knotty; his neck was twisted; and as for his jaws, they were so long and heavy that they made his head look twice too large for his body  The giant held him by a thick halter, and seemed to be dragging him forward by main force, the animal was so lazy and so hard to move  Every now and then, when the beast tried to stand still, the giant would give him a blow on the ribs with his big iron club, which sounded as loud as the thundering of a great billow against the rough-headed rocks of the coast', " When he gave him a pull forward by the halter, the wonder was that he did not drag the animal's head away from his body; and, on the other hand, the horse often gave the halter such a tremendous tug backwards that it was equally wonderful how the arm of the giant was not torn away from his shoulder", ' When at last he had come up he bowed his head and bended his knee, and saluted the King with great respect  Finn addressed him; and after having given him leave to speak he asked him who he was, and what was his name, and whether he belonged to one of the noble or ignoble races; also what was his profession or craft, and why he had no servant to attend to his horse  The big man made answer and said, "King of the Feni, whether I come of a noble or of an ignoble race, that, indeed, I cannot tell, for I know not who my father and mother were  As to where I came from, I am a Fomor of Lochlann in the north; but I have no particular dwelling-place, for I am continually travelling about from one country to another, serving the great lords and nobles of the world, and receiving wages for my service  "In the course of my wanderings I have often heard of you, O King, and of your greatness and splendour and royal bounty; and I have come now to ask you to take me into your service for one year; and at the end of that time I shall fix my own wages, according to my custom  "You ask me also why I have no servant for this great horse of mine  The reason of that is this: at every meal I eat my master must give me as much food and drink as would be enough for a hundred men; and whosoever the lord or chief may be that takes me into his service, it is quite enough for him to have to provide for me, without having also to feed my servant  "Moreover, I am so very heavy and lazy that I should never be able to keep up with a company on march if I had to walk;

an\' he rinted the biggest farm on this side iv the Galties; an\' bein\' mighty cute an\' a sevare worker, it was small wonder he turned a good penny every harvest', " But, unluckily, he was blessed with an ilegant large family iv daughters, an' iv coorse, his heart was allamost bruck, striving to make up fortunes for the whole of them", " An' there wasn't a conthrivance iv any soart or description for makin' money out iv the farm but he was up to", ' "Well, among the other ways he had iv gettin\' up in the world he always kep a power iv turkeys, and all soarts iv poultrey;

Then the monkey held up his persimmon-seed and said: "I also have found something good! Look!" Now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit, he had no use for the seed he had just found  The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone', " He, therefore, in his greedy nature, felt very envious of the crab's nice dumpling, and he proposed an exchange", " The crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone-like seed, and would not consent to the monkey's proposition", ' Then the cunning monkey began to persuade the crab, saying: "How unwise you are not to think of the future! Your rice-dumpling can be eaten now, and is certainly much bigger than my seed; but if you sow this seed in the ground it will soon grow and become a great tree in a few years, and bear an abundance of fine ripe persimmons year after year', " If only I could show it to you then with the yellow fruit hanging on its branches! Of course, if you don't believe me I shall sow it myself; though I am sure, later on, you will be very sorry that you did not take my advice", '" The simple-minded crab could not resist the monkey\'s clever persuasion', " He at last gave in and consented to the monkey's proposal, and the exchange was made", ' The greedy monkey soon gobbled up the dumpling, and with great reluctance gave up the persimmon-seed to the crab  He would have liked to keep that too, but he was afraid of making the crab angry and of being pinched by his sharp scissor-like claws  They then separated, the monkey going home to his forest trees and the crab to his stones along the river-side  As soon as the crab reached home he put the persimmon-seed in the ground as the monkey had told him  In the following spring the crab was delighted to see the shoot of a young tree push its way up through the ground  Each year it grew bigger, till at last it blossomed one spring, and in the following autumn bore some fine large persimmons  Among the broad smooth green leaves the fruit hung like golden balls, and as they ripened they mellowed to a deep orange', " It was the little crab's pleasure to go out day by day and sit in the sun and put out his long eyes in the same way as a snail puts out its horn, and watch the persimmons ripening to perfection", ' "How delicious they will be to eat!" he said to himself  At last, one day, he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one', " He made several attempts to climb the tree, in the vain hope of reaching one of the beautiful persimmons hanging above him; but he failed each time, for a crab's legs are not made for climbing trees but only for running along the ground and over stones, both of which he can do most cleverly", ' In his dilemma he thought of his old playmate the monkey, who, he knew, could climb trees better than any one else in the world  He determined to ask the monkey to help him, and set out to find him  Running crab-fashion up the stony river bank, over the pathways into the shadowy forest, the crab at last found the monkey taking an afternoon nap in his favorite pine-tree, with his tail curled tight around a branch to prevent him from falling off in his dreams  He was soon wide awake, however, when he heard himself called, and eagerly listening to what the crab told him  When he heard that the seed which he had long ago exchanged for a rice-dumpling had grown into a tree and was now bearing good fruit, he was delighted, for he at once devised a cunning plan which would give him all the persimmons for himself  He consented to go with the crab to pick the fruit for him  When they both reached the spot, the monkey was astonished to see what a fine tree had sprung from the seed, and with what a number of ripe persimmons the branches were loaded  He quickly climbed the tree and began to pluck and eat, as fast as he could, one persimmon after another  Each time he chose the best and ripest he could find, and went on eating till he could eat no more  A king once died, as kings are apt to do, being as liable to shortness of breath as other mortals  It was high time this king abandoned his earth life, for he had lived in a sadly extravagant manner, and his subjects could spare him without the slightest inconvenience  His father had left him a full treasury, both money and jewels being in abundance  But the foolish king just deceased had squandered every penny in riotous living  He had then taxed his subjects until most of them became paupers, and this money vanished in more riotous living  Next he sold all the grand old furniture in the palace; all the silver and gold plate and bric-a-brac; all the rich carpets and furnishings and even his own kingly wardrobe, reserving only a soiled and moth-eaten ermine robe to fold over his threadbare raiment  And he spent the money in further riotous living', " Don't ask me to explain what riotous living is", ' I only know, from hearsay, that it is an excellent way to get rid of money  And so this spendthrift king found it  He now picked all the magnificent jewels from this kingly crown and from the round ball on the top of his scepter, and sold them and spent the money  Riotous living, of course  But at last he was at the end of his resources', " He couldn't sell the crown itself, because no one but the king had the right to wear it", ' Neither could he sell the royal palace, because only the king had the right to live there  So, finally, he found himself reduced to a bare palace, containing only a big mahogany bedstead that he slept in, a small stool on which he sat to pull off his shoes and the moth-eaten ermine robe  In this straight he was reduced to the necessity of borrowing an occasional dime from his chief counselor, with which to buy a ham sandwich', " And the chief counselor hadn't many dimes", ' One who counseled his king so foolishly was likely to ruin his own prospects as well  So the king, having nothing more to live for, died suddenly and left a ten-year-old son to inherit the dismantled kingdom, the moth-eaten robe and the jewel-stripped crown  No one envied the child, who had scarcely been thought of until he became king himself  Then he was recognized as a personage of some importance, and the politicians and hangers-on, headed by the chief counselor of the kingdom, held a meeting to determine what could be done for him  These folk had helped the old king to live riotously while his money lasted, and now they were poor and too proud to work', " So they tried to think of a plan that would bring more money into the little king's treasury, where it would be handy for them to help themselves", ' After the meeting was over the chief counselor came to the young king, who was playing peg-top in the courtyard, and said: "Your majesty, we have thought of a way to restore your kingdom to its former power and magnificence " "All right," replied his majesty, carelessly  "How will you do it?" "By marrying you to a lady of great wealth," replied the counselor  "Marrying me!" cried the king  "Why, I am only ten years old!" "I know; it is to be regretted  But your majesty will grow older, and the affairs of the kingdom demand that you marry a wife  Rabbi Lion, of the ancient city of Prague, sat in his study in the Ghetto looking very troubled', " Through the window he could see the River Moldau with the narrow streets of the Jewish quarter clustered around the cemetery, which still stands to-day, and where is to be seen this famous man's tomb", " Beyond the Ghetto rose the towers and spires of the city, but just at that moment it was not the cruelty of the people to the Jews that occupied the rabbi's thoughts", ' He was unable to find a servant, even one to attend the fire on the Sabbath for him  The truth was that the people were a little afraid of the rabbi  He was a very learned man, wise and studious, and a scientist; and because he did wonderful things people called him a magician  His experiments in chemistry frightened them  Late at nights they saw little spurts of blue and red flame shine from his window, and they said that demons and witches came at his beck and call  So nobody would enter his service  "If, as they declare, I am truly a magician," he said to himself, "why should I not make for myself a servant, one that will tend the fire for me on the Sabbath?" He set to work on his novel idea and in a few weeks had completed his mechanical creature, a woman  She looked like a big, strong, laboring woman, and the rabbi was greatly pleased with his handiwork  "Now to endow it with life," he said  Carefully, in the silence of his mysterious study at midnight, he wrote out the Unpronounceable Sacred Name of God on a piece of parchment  Then he rolled it up and placed it in the mouth of the creature  Immediately it sprang up and began to move like a living thing  It rolled its eyes, waved its arms, and nearly walked through the window  In alarm, Rabbi Lion snatched the parchment from its mouth and the creature fell helpless to the floor  "I must be careful," said the rabbi  "It is a wonderful machine with its many springs and screws and levers, and will be most useful to me as soon as I learn to control it properly " All the people marveled when they saw the rabbi\'s machine-woman running errands and doing many duties, controlled only by his thoughts  She could do everything but speak, and Rabbi Lion discovered that he must take the Name from her mouth before he went to sleep  Otherwise, she might have done mischief  One cold Sabbath afternoon, the rabbi was preaching in the synagogue and the little children stood outside his house looking at the machine-woman seated by the window  When they rolled their eyes she did, and at last they shouted: "Come and play with us " She promptly jumped through the window and stood among the boys and girls  "We are cold," said one  "Canst thou make a fire for us?" The creature was made to obey orders, so she at once collected sticks and lit a fire in the street  Then, with the children, she danced round the blaze in great glee  She piled on all the sticks and old barrels she could find, and soon the fire spread and caught a house  The children ran away in fear while the fire blazed so furiously that the whole town became alarmed  A prize, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small one, had been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,--not in a single race, but for the whole year  "I obtained the first prize," said the hare  "Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself " "No," said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; "there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance  I have heard many respectable people say so, and I can quite understand it  The snail certainly took half a year to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself, and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made  He gave himself up entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which was all, of course, very praiseworthy; and therefore he obtained the second prize " "I think I ought to have had some consideration too," said the swallow  "I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight than I am; and how far I have been! far, far away " "Yes, that is your misfortune," said the fence-rail; "you are so fickle, so unsettled; you must always be travelling about into foreign lands when the cold commences here  You have no love of fatherland in you  There can be no consideration for you " "But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the moor," said the swallow, "and suppose I slept the whole time, would that be taken into account?" "Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen," said he, "that you have slept away half your time in fatherland; then you will be treated with some consideration " "I deserved the first prize, and not the second," said the snail  "I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay  I, on the other hand, made running the business of my life, and have become a cripple in the service  If any one had a first prize, it ought to have been myself  But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on the contrary, I despise it " And the snail spat at them with contempt  "I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize--at least, those for which I voted--was given with just and proper consideration," said the old boundary post in the wood, who was a member of the committee of judges  "I always act with due order, consideration, and calculation  Seven times have I already had the honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote; but to-day is the first time I have been able to carry out my will  I always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from the beginning, and the second by going through from the end  Be so kind as to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I reckon from the beginning  The eighth letter from A is H, and there we have H for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the first prize  The eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is S, and therefore the snail received the second prize  Next year, the letter I will have its turn for the first prize, and the letter R for the second " "I should really have voted for myself," said the mule, "if I had not been one of the judges on the committee  Not only the rapidity with which advance is made, but every other quality should have due consideration; as, for instance, how much weight a candidate is able to draw; but I have not brought this quality forward now, nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with which he suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead people on a false track, thinking he has concealed himself  No; there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left unnoticed' ,  " 'Phew!' cried Lisa", " 'Ugh!' cried Aina", " 'What now?' cried the big sister", " 'A worm!' cried Lisa", " 'On the raspberry!' cried Aina", " 'Kill it!' cried Otto", " 'What a fuss over a poor little worm!' said the big sister scornfully", " 'Yes, when we had cleaned the raspberries so carefully,' said Lisa", " 'It crept out from that very large one,' put in Aina", " 'And supposing someone had eaten the raspberry,' said Lisa", " 'Then they would have eaten the worm, too,' said Aina", " 'Well, what harm?' said Otto", " 'Eat a worm!' cried Lisa", " 'And kill him with one bite!' murmured Aina", " 'Just think of it!' said Otto laughing", " 'Now it is crawling on the table,' cried Aina again", " 'Blow it away!' said the big sister", " 'Tramp on it!' laughed Otto", ' But Lisa took a raspberry leaf, swept the worm carefully on to the leaf and carried it out into the yard  Then Aina noticed that a sparrow sitting on the fence was just ready to pounce on the poor little worm, so she took up the leaf, carried it out into the wood and hid it under a raspberry bush where the greedy sparrow could not find it  Yes, and what more is there to tell about a raspberry worm? Who would give three straws for such a miserable little thing? Yes, but who would not like to live in such a pretty home as it lives in; in such a fresh fragrant dark-red cottage, far away in the quiet wood among flowers and green leaves! Now it was just dinner time, so they all had a dinner of raspberries and cream', " 'Be careful with the sugar, Otto,' said the big sister; but Otto's plate was like a snowdrift in winter, with just a little red under the snow", " Soon after dinner the big sister said: 'Now we have eaten up the raspberries and we have none left to make preserve for the winter; it would be fine if we could get two baskets full of berries, then we could clean them this evening, and to-morrow we could cook them in the big preserving pan, and then we should have raspberry jam to eat on our bread!' 'Come, let us go to the wood and pick,' said Lisa", " 'Yes, let us,' said Aina", " 'You take the yellow basket and I will take the green one", "' 'Don't get lost, and come back safely in the evening,' said the big sister", " 'Greetings to the raspberry worm,' said Otto, mockingly", " 'Next time I meet him I shall do him the honour of eating him up", "' So Aina and Lisa went off to the wood", ' Ah! how delightful it was there, how beautiful! It was certainly tiresome sometimes climbing over the fallen trees, and getting caught in the branches, and waging war with the juniper bushes and the midges, but what did that matter? The girls climbed well in their short dresses, and soon they were deep in the wood' ,  " There were ance twa widows that lived on a small bit o' ground, which they rented from a farmer", ' Ane of them had twa sons, and the other had ane; and by-and-by it was time for the wife that had twa sons to send them away to seeke their fortune', " So she told her eldest son ae day to take a can and bring her water from the well, that she might bake a cake for him; and however much or however little water he might bring, the cake would be great or sma' accordingly; and that cake was to be a' that she could gie him when he went on his travels", " The lad gaed away wi' the can to the well, and filled it wi' water, and then came away hame again; but the can being broken the maist part of the water had run out before he got back", " So his cake was very sma'; yet sma' as it was, his mother asked if he was willing to take the half of it with her blessing, telling him that, if he chose rather to have the hale, he would only get it wi' her curse", " The young man, thinking he might hae to travel a far way, and not knowing when or how he might get other provisions, said he would like to hae the hale cake, com of his mother's malison what like; so she gave him the hale cake, and her malison alang wi't", ' Then he took his brither aside, and gave him a knife to keep till he should come back, desiring him to look at it every morning, and as lang as it continued to be clear, then he might be sure that the owner of it was well; but if it grew dim and rusty, then for certain some ill had befallen him  So the young man set out to seek his fortune', " And he gaed a' that day, and a' the next day; and on the third day, in the afternoon, he came up to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock o' sheep", " And he gaed up to the shepherd and asked him wha the sheep belanged to; and the man answered: So the young man went on, and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very dreadfu' beasts, ilk ane o' them wi' twa heads, and on every head four horns", " And he was sore frightened, and ran away from them as fast as he could; and glad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock, wi' the door standing wide to the wa'", ' And he gaed into the castle for shelter, and there he saw an auld wife sitting beside the kitchen fire', " He asked the wife if he might stay there for the night, as he was tired wi' a lang journey; and the wife said he might, but it was not a good place for him to be in, as it belanged to the Red Etin, who was a very terrible beast, wi' three heads, that spared no living man he could get hold of", ' The young man would have gone away, but he was afraid of the beasts on the outside of the castle; so he beseeched the old woman to conceal him as well as she could, and not to tell the Etin that he was there', " He thought, if he could put over the night, he might get away in the morning without meeting wi' the beasts, and so escape", ' But he had not been long in his hidy-hole before the awful Etin came in; and nae sooner was he in than he was heard crying: The monster soon found the poor young man, and pulled him from his hole  And when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him three questions his life should be spared  The first was: Whether Ireland or Scotland was first inhabited? The second was: Whether man was made for woman, or woman for man? The third was: Whether men or brutes were made first? The lad not being able to answer one of these questions, the Red Etin took a mace and knocked him on the head, and turned him into a pillar of stone', " On the morning after this happened the younger brither took out the knife to look at it, and he was grieved to find it a' brown wi' rust", ' He told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels also; so she requested him to take the can to the well for water, that she might bake a cake for him  The can being broken, he brought hame as little water as the other had done, and the cake was as little', " She asked whether he would have the hale cake wi' her malison, or the half wi' her blessing; and, like his brither, he thought it best to have the hale cake, come o' the malison what might", " So he gaed away; and everything happened to him that had happened to his brother! The other widow and her son heard of a' that had happened frae a fairy, and the young man determined that he would also go upon his travels, and see if he could do anything to relieve his twa friends", ' So his mother gave him a can to go to the well and bring home water, that she might bake him a cake for his journey  And he gaed, and as he was bringing hame the water, a raven owre abune his head cried to him to look, and he would see that the water was running out  And he was a young man of sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some clay and patched up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake', " When his mother put it to him to take the half-cake wi' her blessing, he took it in preference to having the hale wi' her malison; and yet the half was bigger than what the other lads had got a'thegither", " So he gaed away on his journey; and after he had traveled a far way he met wi' an auld woman, that asked him if he would give her a bit of his bannock", ' And he said he would gladly do that, and so he gave her a piece of the bannock; and for that she gied him a magical wand, that she said might yet be of service to him if he took care to use it rightly', " Then the auld woman, who was a fairy, told him a great deal that whould happen to him, and what he ought to do in a' circumstances; and after that she vanished in an instant out o' his sight" ,  ' There was a poor man there  He had a great family of sons  He had no means to put them forward  He had them at school  One day, when they were coming from school, he thought that whichever of them was last at the door he would keep him out  It was the youngest of the family that was last at the door  The father shut the door  He would not let him in  The boy went weeping  He would not let him in till night came  The father said he would never let him in--that he had boys enough  The lad went away  He was walking till night  He came to a house on the rugged side of a hill on a height, one feather giving it shelter and support  He went in  He got a place till morning  When he made his breakfast in the morning he was going  The man of the house made him a present of a red pony, a saddle, and bridle  He went riding on the pony  He went away with himself  "Now," said the pony, "whatever thing you may see before you, don\'t touch it " They went on with themselves  He saw a light before him on the high road  When he came as far as the light, there was an open box on the road, and a light coming out of it  He took up the box  There was a lock of hair in it  "Are you going to take up the box?" said the pony  "I am  I cannot go past it " "It\'s better for you to leave it," said the pony There was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate, but in summer she was forced to run about with bare feet, she was so poor, and in winter wear very large wooden shoes, which made her little insteps quite red, and that looked so dangerous! In the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker; she sat and sewed together, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of old red strips of cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind thought  They were meant for the little girl  The little girl was called Karen  On the very day her mother was buried, Karen received the red shoes, and wore them for the first time  They were certainly not intended for mourning, but she had no others, and with stockingless feet she followed the poor straw coffin in them  Suddenly a large old carriage drove up, and a large old lady sat in it: she looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then said to the clergyman: "Here, give me the little girl  I will adopt her!" And Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt  But Karen herself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew; and people said she was a nice little thing, but the looking-glass said: "Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!" Now the queen once travelled through the land, and she had her little daughter with her  And this little daughter was a princess, and people streamed to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little princess stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be stared at; she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid red morocco shoes  They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame Shoemaker had made for little Karen  Nothing in the world can be compared with red shoes  Now Karen was old enough to be confirmed; she had new clothes and was to have new shoes also  The rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of her little foot  This took place at his house, in his room; where stood large glass-cases, filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots  All this looked charming, but the old lady could not see well, and so had no pleasure in them  In the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones, just like those the princess had worn  How beautiful they were! The shoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count, but had not fitted  "That must be patent leather!" said the old lady  "They shine so!" "Yes, they shine!" said Karen, and they fitted, and were bought, but the old lady knew nothing about their being red, else she would never have allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed  Yet such was the case', " Everybody looked at her feet; and when she stepped through the chancel door on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old figures on the tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with stiff ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her red shoes", " And she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her head, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and how she should be now a matured Christian; and the organ pealed so solemnly; the sweet children's voices sang, and the old music-directors sang, but Karen only thought of her red shoes", ' In the afternoon, the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had been red, and she said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was not at all becoming, and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes to church, even when she should be older  The next Sunday there was the sacrament, and Karen looked at the black shoes, looked at the red ones--looked at them again, and put on the red shoes  The sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path through the corn; it was rather dusty there  At the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with a wonderfully long beard, which was more red than white, and he bowed to the ground, and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes  And Karen stretched out her little foot  "See, what beautiful dancing shoes!" said the soldier  "Sit firm when you dance"; and he put his hand out towards the soles  And the old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the church with Karen  Rosy-red was a sweet little girl, with beautiful blue eyes, soft pink cheeks and glorious ruddy-gold hair of the tinge that artists love to paint  Her mother died the day she was born, but her grandmother looked after her with such tender care that Rosy-red regarded her as her mother  She was very happy, was Rosy-red  All day long she sang, as she tripped gaily about the house or the woods that surrounded it, and so melodious was her voice that the birds gathered on the trees to listen to her and to encourage her to continue, by daintily chirruping whenever she ceased', " Merrily Rosy-red performed all the little duties her grandmother called upon her to do, and on festivals she was allowed to wear a delightful pair of red leather slippers, her father's gift to her on her first birthday", ' Now, although neither she nor her father knew it, they were magic slippers which grew larger as her feet grew', " Rosy-red was only a child and so did not know that slippers don't usually grow", ' Her grandmother knew the secret of the slippers, but she did not tell, and her father had become too moody and too deeply absorbed in his own thoughts and affairs to notice anything  One day--Rosy-red remembered it only too sadly--she returned from the woods to find her grandmother gone and three strange women in the house  She stopped suddenly in the midst of her singing and her cheeks turned pale, for she did not like the appearance of the strangers  "Who are you?" she asked  "I am your new mother," answered the eldest of the three, "and these are my daughters, your two new sisters " Rosy-red trembled with fear  They were all three so ugly, and she began to cry  Her new sisters scolded her for that and would have beaten her had not her father appeared  He spoke kindly, telling her he had married again, because he was lonely and that her step-mother and step-sisters would be good to her  But Rosy-red knew different  She hastened away to her own little room and hid her slippers of which she was very proud  "They have turned my dear granny out of doors; they will take from me my beautiful slippers," she sobbed  After that, Rosy-red sang no more  She became a somber girl and a drudge  The birds could not understand  They followed her through the woods, but she was silent, as if she had been stricken dumb, and her eyes always seemed eager to be shedding tears  Also, she was too busy to notice her feathered friends  She had to collect firewood for the home, to draw water from the well and struggle along with the heavy bucket whose weight made her arms and her back ache with pain  Sometimes, too, her white arms were scarred with bruises, for her cruel and selfish step-sisters did not hesitate to beat her  Often they went out to parties, or to dances, and on these occasions she had to act as their maid and help them to dress  Rosy-red did not mind; she was only happy when they were out of the house  Then only did she sing softly to herself, and the birds came to listen  And thus many unhappy years passed away  "That was a terrible affair!" said a hen, and in a quarter of the town, too, where it had not taken place  "That was a terrible affair in a hen-roost  I cannot sleep alone to-night  It is a good thing that many of us sit on the roost together " And then she told a story that made the feathers on the other hens bristle up, and the cock\'s comb fall  There was no doubt about it  But we will begin at the beginning, and that is to be found in a hen-roost in another part of the town  The sun was setting, and the fowls were flying on to their roost; one hen, with white feathers and short legs, used to lay her eggs according to the regulations, and was, as a hen, respectable in every way  As she was flying upon the roost, she plucked herself with her beak, and a little feather came out  "There it goes," she said; "the more I pluck, the more beautiful do I get " She said this merrily, for she was the best of the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable  With that she went to sleep  It was dark all around, and hen sat close to hen, but the one who sat nearest to her merry neighbour did not sleep  She had heard and yet not heard, as we are often obliged to do in this world, in order to live at peace; but she could not keep it from her neighbour on the other side any longer  "Did you hear what was said? I mention no names, but there is a hen here who intends to pluck herself in order to look well  If I were a cock, I should despise her " Just over the fowls sat the owl, with father owl and the little owls  The family has sharp ears, and they all heard every word that their neighbour had said  They rolled their eyes, and mother owl, beating her wings, said: "Don\'t listen to her! But I suppose you heard what was said? I heard it with my own ears, and one has to hear a great deal before they fall off  There is one among the fowls who has so far forgotten what is becoming to a hen that she plucks out all her feathers and lets the cock see it " "Prenez garde aux enfants!" said father owl; "children should not hear such things " "But I must tell our neighbour owl about it; she is such an estimable owl to talk to " And with that she flew away  "Too-whoo! Too-whoo!" they both hooted into the neighbour\'s dove-cot to the doves inside  "Have you heard? Have you heard? Too-whoo! There is a hen who has plucked out all her feathers for the sake of the cock; she will freeze to death, if she is not frozen already  Too-whoo!" "Where? where?" cooed the doves  "In the neighbour\'s yard  I have as good as seen it myself  It is almost unbecoming to tell the story, but there is no doubt about it " "Believe every word of what we tell you," said the doves, and cooed down into their poultry-yard' ,  " THE King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings", ' He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived  She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer', " The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself", ' Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered  "She is like a white rose!" they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies  At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand  "Your picture was beautiful," he murmured, "but you are more beautiful than your picture"; and the little Princess blushed  "She was like a white rose before," said a young Page to his neighbour, "but she is like a red rose now"; and the whole Court was delighted  For the next three days everybody went about saying, "White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"; and the King gave orders that the Page\'s salary was to be doubled  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette  When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated  It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls  Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy  "It\'s quite clear that they love each other," said the little Page, "as clear as crystal!" and the King doubled his salary a second time  "What an honour!" cried all the courtiers  After the banquet there was to be a Ball  The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, "Charming! charming!" The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight  The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage  "What are fireworks like?" she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace  "They are like the Aurora Borealis," said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, "only much more natural  I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing  You must certainly see them  There was once a rich old man who had two sons, and as his wife was dead, the elder lived with him, and helped him to look after his property  For a long time all went well; the young man got up very early in the morning, and worked hard all day, and at the end of every week his father counted up the money they had made, and rubbed his hands with delight, as he saw how big the pile of gold in the strong iron chest was becoming', " 'It will soon be full now, and I shall have to buy a larger one,' he said to himself, and so busy was he with the thought of his money, that he did not notice how bright his son's face had grown, nor how he sometimes started when he was spoken to, as if his mind was far away", ' One day, however, the old man went to the city on business, which he had not done for three years at least  It was market day, and he met with many people he knew, and it was getting quite late when he turned into the inn yard, and bade an ostler saddle his horse, and bring it round directly  While he was waiting in the hall, the landlady came up for a gossip, and after a few remarks about the weather and the vineyards she asked him how he liked his new daughter-in-law, and whether he had been surprised at the marriage  The old man stared as he listened to her', " 'Daughter-in-law? Marriage?' said he", " 'I don't know what you are talking about! I've got no daughter-in-law, and nobody has been married lately, that I ever heard of", "' Now this was exactly what the landlady, who was very curious, wanted to find out; but she put on a look of great alarm, and exclaimed: 'Oh, dear! I hope I have not made mischief", " I had no idea--or, of course, I would not have spoken--but'--and here she stopped and fumbled with her apron, as if she was greatly embarrassed", " 'As you have said so much you will have to say a little more,' retorted the old man, a suspicion of what she meant darting across him; and the woman, nothing loth, answered as before", " 'Ah, it was not all for buying or selling that your handsome son has been coming to town every week these many months past", " And not by the shortest way, either! No, it was over the river he rode, and across the hill and past the cottage of Miguel the vine-keeper, whose daughter, they say, is the prettiest girl in the whole country side, though she is too white for my taste,' and then the landlady paused again, and glanced up at the farmer, to see how he was taking it", ' She did not learn much  He was looking straight before him, his teeth set', " But as she ceased to talk, he said quietly, 'Go on", "' 'There is not much more to tell,' replied the landlady, for she suddenly remembered that she must prepare supper for the hungry men who always stopped at the inn on market days, before starting for home, 'but one fine morning they both went to the little church on top of the hill, and were married", ' My cousin is servant to the priest, and she found out about it and told me  But good-day to you, sir; here is your horse, and I must hurry off to the kitchen', "' It was lucky that the horse was sure-footed and knew the road, for his bridle hung loose on his neck, and his master took no heed of the way he was going", ' When the farm-house was reached, the man led the animal to the stable, and then went to look for his son', " 'I know everything--you have deceived me", " Get out of my sight at once--I have done with you,' he stammered, choking with passion as he came up to the young man, who was cutting a stick in front of the door, whistling gaily the while", " 'But, father--' 'You are no son of mine; I have only one now", " Begone, or it will be the worse for you,' and as he spoke he lifted up his whip", ' The young man shrank back  He feared lest his father should fall down in a fit, his face was so red and his eyes seemed bursting from his head  But it was no use staying: perhaps next morning the old man might listen to reason, though in his heart the son felt that he would never take back his words  So he turned slowly away, and walked heavily along a path which ended in a cave on the side of his hill, and there he sat through the night, thinking of what had happened  In days long past there lived a poor woodcutter who found life very hard  Indeed, it was his lot to toil for little guerdon, and although he was young and happily married there were moments when he wished himself dead and below ground  One day while at his work he was again lamenting his fate  "Some men," he said, "have only to make known their desires, and straightway these are granted, and their every wish fulfilled; but it has availed me little to wish for ought, for the gods are deaf to the prayers of such as I " As he spoke these words there was a great noise of thunder, and Jupiter appeared before him wielding his mighty thunderbolts  Our poor man was stricken with fear and threw himself on the ground  "My lord," he said, "forget my foolish speech; heed not my wishes, but cease thy thundering!" "Have no fear," answered Jupiter; "I have heard thy plaint, and have come hither to show thee how greatly thou dost wrong me  Hark! I, who am sovereign lord of this world, promise to grant in full the first three wishes which it will please thee to utter, whatever these may be  Consider well what things can bring thee joy and prosperity, and as thy happiness is at stake, be not over-hasty, but revolve the matter in thy mind " Having thus spoken Jupiter withdrew himself and made his ascent to Olympus  As for our woodcutter, he blithely corded his faggot, and throwing it over his shoulder, made for his home  To one so light of heart the load also seemed light, and his thoughts were merry as he strode along  Many a wish came into his mind, but he was resolved to seek the advice of his wife, who was a young woman of good understanding  He had soon reached his cottage, and casting down his faggot: "Behold me, Fanny," he said  "Make up the fire and spread the board, and let there be no stint  We are wealthy, Fanny, wealthy for evermore; we have only to wish for whatsoever we may desire " Thereupon he told her the story of what had befallen that day', " Fanny, whose mind was quick and active, immediately conceived many plans for the advancement of their fortune, but she approved her husband's resolve to act with prudence and circumspection", ' "\'Twere a pity," she said, "to spoil our chances through impatience  We had best take counsel of the night, and wish no wishes until to-morrow " "That is well spoken," answered Harry  "Meanwhile fetch a bottle of our best, and we shall drink to our good fortune " Fanny brought a bottle from the store behind the faggots, and our man enjoyed his ease, leaning back in his chair with his toes to the fire and his goblet in his hand   Illustration: "A LONG BLACK PUDDING CAME WINDING AND WRIGGLING TOWARDS HER"  "What fine glowing embers!" he said, "and what a fine toasting fire! I wish we had a black pudding at hand " Hardly had he spoken these words when his wife beheld, to her great astonishment, a long black pudding which, issuing from a corner of the hearth, came winding and wriggling towards her  She uttered a cry of fear, and then again exclaimed in dismay, when she perceived that this strange occurrence was due to the wish which her husband had so rashly and foolishly spoken  Turning upon him, in her anger and disappointment she called the poor man all the abusive names that she could think of  "What!" she said to him, "when you can call for a kingdom, for gold, pearls, rubies, diamonds, for princely garments and wealth untold, is this the time to set your mind upon black puddings!" "Nay!" answered the man, "\'twas a thoughtless speech, and a sad mistake; but I shall now be on my guard, and shall do better next time " "Who knows that you will?" returned his wife  "Once a witless fool, always a witless fool!" and giving free rein to her vexation and ill-temper she continued to upbraid her husband until his anger also was stirred, and he had wellnigh made a second bid and wished himself a widower' ,  " In a tiny cottage near the king's palace there once lived an old man, his wife, and his son, a very lazy fellow, who would never do a stroke of work", ' He could not be got even to look after their one cow, but left her to look after herself, while he lay on a bank and went to sleep in the sun', " For a long time his father bore with him, hoping that as he grew older he might gain more sense; but at last the old man's patience was worn out, and he told his son that he should not stay at house in idleness, and must go out into the world to seek his fortune", ' The young man saw that there was no help for it, and he set out with a wallet full of food over his shoulder  At length he came to a large house, at the door of which he knocked', " 'What do you want?' asked the old man who opened it", ' And the youth told him how his father had turned him out of his house because he was so lazy and stupid, and he needed shelter for the night', " 'That you shall have,' replied the man; 'but to-morrow I shall give you some work to do, for you must know that I am the chief herdsman of the king", "' The youth made no answer to this", ' He felt, if he was to be made to work after all, that he might as well have stayed where he was  But as he did not see any other way of getting a bed, he went slowly in', " The herdsman's two daughters and their mother were sitting at supper, and invited him to join them", ' Nothing more was said about work, and when the meal was over they all went to bed', " In the morning, when the young man was dressed, the herdsman called to him and said: 'Now listen, and I will tell you what you have to do", "' 'What is it?' asked the youth, sulkily", " 'Nothing less than to look after two hundred pigs,' was the reply", " 'Oh, I am used to that,' answered the youth", " 'Yes; but this time you will have to do it properly,' said the herdsman; and he took the youth to the place where the pigs were feeding, and told him to drive them to the woods on the side of the mountain", " This the young man did, but as soon as they reached the outskirts of the mountain they grew quite wild, and would have run away altogether, had they not luckily gone towards a narrow ravine, from which the youth easily drove them home to his father's cottage", " 'Where do all these pigs come from, and how did you get them?' asked the old man in surprise, when his son knocked at the door of the hut he had left only the day before", " 'They belong to the king's chief herdsman,' answered his son", " 'He gave them to me to look after, but I knew I could not do it, so I drove them straight to you", ' Now make the best of your good fortune, and kill them and hang them up at once', "' 'What are you talking about?' cried the father, pale with horror", " 'We should certainly both be put to death if I did any such thing", "' 'No, no; do as I tell you, and I will get out of it somehow,' replied the young man", ' And in the end he had his way  The pigs were killed, and laid side by side in a row  Then he cut off the tails and tied them together with a piece of cord, and swinging the bundle over his back, he returned to the place where they should have been feeding  Here there was a small swamp, which was just what he wanted, and finding a large stone, he fastened the rope to it, and sank it in the swamp, after which he arranged the tails carefully one by one, so that only their points were seen sticking out of the water  A long way off, near the sea coast of the east of Africa, there dwelt, once upon a time, a man and his wife  They had two children, a son and a daughter, whom they loved very much, and, like parents in other countries, they often talked of the fine marriages the young people would make some day  Out there both boys and girls marry early, and very soon, it seemed to the mother, a message was sent by a rich man on the other side of the great hills offering a fat herd of oxen in exchange for the girl  Everyone in the house and in the village rejoiced, and the maiden was despatched to her new home', " When all was quiet again the father said to his son: 'Now that we own such a splendid troop of oxen you had better hasten and get yourself a wife, lest some illness should overtake them", ' Already we have seen in the villages round about one or two damsels whose parents would gladly part with them for less than half the herd  Therefore tell us which you like best, and we will buy her for you', "' But the son answered: 'Not so; the maidens I have seen do not please me", ' If, indeed, I must marry, let me travel and find a wife for myself', "' 'It shall be as you wish,' said the parents; 'but if by-and-by trouble should come of it, it will be your fault and not ours", "' The youth, however, would not listen; and bidding his father and mother farewell, set out on his search", ' Far, far away he wandered, over mountains and across rivers, till he reached a village where the people were quite different from those of his own race  He glanced about him and noticed that the girls were fair to look upon, as they pounded maize or stewed something that smelt very nice in earthen pots--especially if you were hot and tired; and when one of the maidens turned round and offered the stranger some dinner, he made up his mind that he would wed her and nobody else  So he sent a message to her parents asking their leave to take her for his wife, and they came next day to bring their answer', " 'We will give you our daughter,' said they, 'if you can pay a good price for her", " Never was there so hardworking a girl; and how we shall do without her we cannot tell! Still-- no doubt your father and mother will come themselves and bring the price?' 'No; I have the price with me,' replied the young man; laying down a handful of gold pieces", " 'Here it is--take it", "' The old couple's eyes glittered greedily; but custom forbade them to touch the price before all was arranged", " 'At least,' said they, after a moment's pause, 'we may expect them to fetch your wife to her new home?' 'No; they are not used to travelling,' answered the bridegroom", " 'Let the ceremony be performed without delay, and we will set forth at once", ' It is a long journey', "' Then the parents called in the girl, who was lying in the sun outside the hut, and, in the presence of all the village, a goat was killed, the sacred dance took place, and a blessing was said over the heads of the young people", ' After that the bride was led aside by her father, whose duty it was to bestow on her some parting advice as to her conduct in her married life', " 'Be good to your husband's parents,' added he, 'and always do the will of your husband", "' And the girl nodded her head obediently", " Next it was the mother's turn; and, as was the custom of the tribe, she spoke to her daughter: 'Will you choose which of your sisters shall go with you to cut your wood and carry your water?' 'I do not want any of them,' answered she; 'they are no use", ' They will drop the wood and spill the water', "' 'Then will you have any of the other children? There are enough to spare,' asked the mother again", " But the bride said quickly: 'I will have none of them! You must give me our buffalo, the Rover of the Plain; he alone shall serve me", "' 'What folly you talk!' cried the parents" ,  ' Far way, in a very hot country, there once lived a man and woman who had two children, a son named Koane and a daughter called Thakane  Early in the morning and late in the evenings the parents worked hard in the fields, resting, when the sun was high, under the shade of some tree  While they were absent the little girl kept house alone, for her brother always got up before the dawn, when the air was fresh and cool, and drove out the cattle to the sweetest patches of grass he could find  One day, when Koane had slept later than usual, his father and mother went to their work before him, and there was only Thakane to be seen busy making the bread for supper', " 'Thakane,' he said, 'I am thirsty", ' Give me a drink from the tree Koumongoe, which has the best milk in the world', "' 'Oh, Koane,' cried his sister, 'you know that we are forbidden to touch that tree", ' What would father say when he came home? For he would be sure to know', "' 'Nonsense,' replied Koane, 'there is so much milk in Koumongoe that he will never miss a little", " If you won't give it to me, I sha'n't take the cattle out", ' They will just have to stay all day in the hut, and you know that they will starve', "' And he turned from her in a rage, and sat down in the corner", " After a while Thakane said to him: 'It is getting hot, had you better drive out the cattle now?' But Koane only answered sulkily: 'I told you I am not going to drive them out at all", ' If I have to do without milk, they shall do without grass', "' Thakane did not know what to do", ' She was afraid to disobey her parents, who would most likely beat her, yet the beasts would be sure to suffer if they were kept in, and she would perhaps be beaten for that too  So at last she took an axe and a tiny earthen bowl, she cut a very small hole in the side of Koumongoe, and out gushed enough milk to fill the bowl', " 'Here is the milk you wanted,' said she, going up to Koane, who was still sulking in his corner", " 'What is the use of that?' grumbled Koane; 'why, there is not enough to drown a fly", " Go and get me three times as much!' Trembling with fright, Thakane returned to the tree, and struck it a sharp blow with the axe", ' In an instant there poured forth such a stream of milk that it ran like a river into the hut', " 'Koane! Koane!' cried she, 'come and help me to plug up the hole", ' There will be no milk left for our father and mother', "' But Koane could not stop it any more than Thakane, and soon the milk was flowing through the hut downhill towards their parents in the fields below", ' The man saw a white stream a long way off, and guessed what had happened', " 'Wife, wife,' he called loudly to the woman, who was working at a little distance: 'Do you see Koumongoe running fast down the hill? That is some mischief of the children's, I am sure", ' I must go home and find out what is the matter', "' And they both threw down their hoes and hurried to the side of Koumongoe", ' Kneeling on the grass, the man and his wife made a cup of their hands and drank the milk from it  And no sooner had they done this, than Koumongoe flowed back again up the hill, and entered the hut' ,  " Long, long ago, there lived in the province of Shinshin in Japan, a traveling monkey-man, who earned his living by taking round a monkey and showing off the animal's tricks", ' One evening the man came home in a very bad temper and told his wife to send for the butcher the next morning  The wife was very bewildered and asked her husband: "Why do you wish me to send for the butcher?" "It\'s no use taking that monkey round any longer, he\'s too old and forgets his tricks', " I beat him with my stick all I know how, but he won't dance properly", ' I must now sell him to the butcher and make what money out of him I can  There is nothing else to be done " The woman felt very sorry for the poor little animal, and pleaded for her husband to spare the monkey, but her pleading was all in vain, the man was determined to sell him to the butcher  Now the monkey was in the next room and overheard every word of the conversation  He soon understood that he was to be killed, and he said to himself: "Barbarous, indeed, is my master! Here I have served him faithfully for years, and instead of allowing me to end my days comfortably and in peace, he is going to let me be cut up by the butcher, and my poor body is to be roasted and stewed and eaten? Woe is me! What am I to do  Ah! a bright thought has struck me! There is, I know, a wild bear living in the forest near by  I have often heard tell of his wisdom  Perhaps if I go to him and tell him the strait I am in he will give me his counsel  I will go and try " There was no time to lose  The monkey slipped out of the house and ran as quickly as he could to the forest to find the boar  The boar was at home, and the monkey began his tale of woe at once  "Good Mr  Boar, I have heard of your excellent wisdom  I am in great trouble, you alone can help me  I have grown old in the service of my master, and because I cannot dance properly now he intends to sell me to the butcher  What do you advise me to do? I know how clever you are!" The boar was pleased at the flattery and determined to help the monkey  He thought for a little while and then said: "Hasn\'t your master a baby?" "Oh, yes," said the monkey, "he has one infant son " "Doesn\'t it lie by the door in the morning when your mistress begins the work of the day? Well, I will come round early and when I see my opportunity I will seize the child and run off with it " "What then?" said the monkey  "Why the mother will be in a tremendous scare, and before your master and mistress know what to do, you must run after me and rescue the child and take it home safely to its parents, and you will see that when the butcher comes they won\'t have the heart to sell you " The monkey thanked the boar many times and then went home  He did not sleep much that night, as you may imagine, for thinking of the morrow', " His life depended on whether the boar's plan succeeded or not", ' He was the first up, waiting anxiously for what was to happen', " It seemed to him a very long time before his master's wife began to move about and open the shutters to let in the light of day" ,  'Once upon a time there was an old poet, one of those right good old poets  One evening, as he was sitting at home, there was a terrible storm going on outside; the rain was pouring down, but the old poet sat comfortably in his chimney-corner, where the fire was burning and the apples were roasting  "There will not be a dry thread left on the poor people who are out in this weather," he said  "Oh, open the door! I am so cold and wet through," called a little child outside  It was crying and knocking at the door, whilst the rain was pouring down and the wind was rattling all the windows  "Poor creature!" said the poet, and got up and opened the door  Before him stood a little boy; he was naked, and the water flowed from his long fair locks  He was shivering with cold; if he had not been let in, he would certainly have perished in the storm  "Poor little thing!" said the poet, and took him by the hand  "Come to me; I will soon warm you  You shall have some wine and an apple, for you are such a pretty boy " And he was, too  His eyes sparkled like two bright stars, and although the water flowed down from his fair locks, they still curled quite beautifully  He looked like a little angel, but was pale with cold, and trembling all over  In his hand he held a splendid bow, but it had been entirely spoilt by the rain, and the colours of the pretty arrows had run into one another by getting wet  The old man sat down by the fire, and taking the little boy on his knee, wrung the water out of his locks and warmed his hands in his own  He then made him some hot spiced wine, which quickly revived him; so that with reddening cheeks, he sprang upon the floor and danced around the old man  "You are a merry boy," said the latter  "What is your name?" "My name is Cupid," he answered  "Don\'t you know me? There lies my bow  I shoot with that, you know  Look, the weather is getting fine again--the moon is shining " "But your bow is spoilt," said the old poet  "That would be unfortunate," said the little boy, taking it up and looking at it  "Oh, it\'s quite dry and isn\'t damaged at all', " The string is quite tight; I'll try it", '" So, drawing it back, he took an arrow, aimed, and shot the good old poet right in the heart  "Do you see now that my bow was not spoilt?" he said, and, loudly laughing, ran away  What a naughty boy to shoot the old poet like that, who had taken him into his warm room, had been so good to him, and had given him the nicest wine and the best apple! The good old man lay upon the floor crying; he was really shot in the heart  "Oh!" he cried, "what a naughty boy this Cupid is! I shall tell all the good children about this, so that they take care never to play with him, lest he hurt them  There was once a poor old fisherman, and one year he was not getting much fish  On a day of days, while he was fishing, there rose a sea-maiden at the side of his boat, and she asked him, "Are you getting much fish?" The old man answered and said, "Not I " "What reward would you give me for sending plenty of fish to you?" "Ach!" said the old man, "I have not much to spare " "Will you give me the first son you have?" said she  "I would give ye that, were I to have a son," said he  "Then go home, and remember me when your son is twenty years of age, and you yourself will get plenty of fish after this " Everything happened as the sea-maiden said, and he himself got plenty of fish; but when the end of the twenty years was nearing, the old man was growing more and more sorrowful and heavy hearted, while he counted each day as it came  He had rest neither day nor night  The son asked his father one day, "Is any one troubling you?" The old man said, "Some one is, but that\'s nought to do with you nor any one else " The lad said, "I must know what it is " His father told him at last how the matter was with him and the sea-maiden  "Let not that put you in any trouble," said the son; "I will not oppose you " "You shall not; you shall not go, my son, though I never get fish any more " "If you will not let me go with you, go to the smithy, and let the smith make me a great strong sword, and I will go seek my fortune " His father went to the smithy, and the smith made a doughty sword for him  His father came home with the sword  The lad grasped it and gave it a shake or two, and it flew into a hundred splinters  He asked his father to go to the smithy and get him another sword in which there should be twice as much weight; and so his father did, and so likewise it happened to the next sword--it broke in two halves  Back went the old man to the smithy; and the smith made a great sword, its like he never made before  "There\'s thy sword for thee," said the smith, "and the fist must be good that plays this blade " The old man gave the sword to his son; he gave it a shake or two  "This will do," said he; "it\'s high time now to travel on my way " On the next morning he put a saddle on a black horse that his father had, and he took the world for his pillow  When he went on a bit, he fell in with the carcass of a sheep beside the road  And there were a great black dog, a falcon, and an otter, and they were quarrelling over the spoil  So they asked him to divide it for them  He came down off the horse, and he divided the carcass amongst the three  Three shares to the dog, two shares to the otter, and a share to the falcon  "For this," said the dog, "if swiftness of foot or sharpness of tooth will give thee aid, mind me, and I will be at thy side " Said the otter, "If the swimming of foot on the ground of a pool will loose thee, mind me, and I will be at thy side  There was once a fisherman who was called Salmon, and his Christian name was Matte  He lived by the shore of the big sea; where else could he live? He had a wife called Maie; could you find a better name for her? In winter they dwelt in a little cottage by the shore, but in spring they flitted to a red rock out in the sea and stayed there the whole summer until it was autumn  The cottage on the rock was even smaller than the other; it had a wooden bolt instead of an iron lock to the door, a stone hearth, a flagstaff, and a weather-cock on the roof  The rock was called Ahtola, and was not larger than the market-place of a town  Between the crevices there grew a little rowan tree and four alder bushes  Heaven only knows how they ever came there; perhaps they were brought by the winter storms  Besides that, there flourished some tufts of velvety grass, some scattered reeds, two plants of the yellow herb called tansy, four of a red flower, and a pretty white one; but the treasures of the rock consisted of three roots of garlic, which Maie had put in a cleft  Rock walls sheltered them on the north side, and the sun shone on them on the south  This does not seem much, but it sufficed Maie for a herb plot  All good things go in threes, so Matte and his wife fished for salmon in spring, for herring in summer, and for cod in winter  When on Saturdays the weather was fine and the wind favourable, they sailed to the nearest town, sold their fish, and went to church on Sunday  But it often happened that for weeks at a time they were quite alone on the rock Ahtola, and had nothing to look at except their little yellow-brown dog, which bore the grand name of Prince, their grass tufts, their bushes and blooms, the sea bays and fish, a stormy sky and the blue, white-crested waves  For the rock lay far away from the land, and there were no green islets or human habitations for miles round, only here and there appeared a rock of the same red stone as Ahtola, besprinkled day and night with the ocean spray  Matte and Maie were industrious, hard-working folk, happy and contented in their poor hut, and they thought themselves rich when they were able to salt as many casks of fish as they required for winter and yet have some left over with which to buy tobacco for the old man, and a pound or two of coffee for his wife, with plenty of burned corn and chicory in it to give it a flavour  Besides that, they had bread, butter, fish, a beer cask, and a buttermilk jar; what more did they require? All would have gone well had not Maie been possessed with a secret longing which never let her rest; and this was, how she could manage to become the owner of a cow', " 'What would you do with a cow?' asked Matte", " 'She could not swim so far, and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here; and even if we had her, we have nothing to feed her on", "' 'We have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass,' rejoined Maie", " 'Yes, of course,' laughed Matte, 'and we have also three plants of garlic", ' Garlic would be fine feeding for her', "' 'Every cow likes salt herring,' rejoined his wife", " 'Even Prince is fond of fish", "' 'That may be,' said her husband", " 'Methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring", ' All very well for Prince, who fights with the gulls over the last morsel  Put the cow out of your head, mother, we are very well off as we are', "' Maie sighed", ' She knew well that her husband was right, but she could not give up the idea of a cow  The buttermilk no longer tasted as good as usual in the coffee; she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter, and of how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them  One day as Matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they heard Prince barking, and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with three young men in it, steering towards the rock' ,  " EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden", ' It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass  Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit  The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them  "How happy we are here!" they cried to each other        One day the Giant came back  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years  After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle  When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden  "What are you doing here?" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away  "My own garden is my own garden," said the Giant; "any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself " So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board       TRESPASSERS       WILL BE      PROSECUTED He was a very selfish Giant  The poor children had now nowhere to play  They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside  "How happy we were there," they said to each other  Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom  Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost  "Spring has forgotten this garden," they cried, "so we will live here all the year round " The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver  Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came  He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down  "This is a delightful spot," he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit " So the Hail came  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go  He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice  Once upon a time there was a king who determined to take a long voyage  He assembled his fleet and all the seamen, and set out  They went straight on night and day, until they came to an island which was covered with large trees, and under every tree lay a lion  As soon as the King had landed his men, the lions all rose up together and tried to devour them  After a long battle they managed to overcome the wild beasts, but the greater number of the men were killed  Those who remained alive now went on through the forest and found on the other side of it a beautiful garden, in which all the plants of the world flourished together  There were also in the garden three springs: the first flowed with silver, the second with gold, and the third with pearls  The men unbuckled their knapsacks and filled them with those precious things', " In the middle of the garden they found a large lake, and when they reached the edge of it the Lake began to speak, and said to them, 'What men are you, and what brings you here? Are you come to visit our king?' But they were too much frightened to answer", " Then the Lake said, 'You do well to be afraid, for it is at your peril that you are come hither", ' Our king, who has seven heads, is now asleep, but in a few minutes he will wake up and come to me to take his bath! Woe to anyone who meets him in the garden, for it is impossible to escape from him  This is what you must do if you wish to save your lives  Take off your clothes and spread them on the path which leads from here to the castle  The King will then glide over something soft, which he likes very much, and he will be so pleased with that that he will not devour you  He will give you some punishment, but then he will let you go', "' The men did as the Lake advised them, and waited for a time", ' At noon the earth began to quake, and opened in many places, and out of the openings appeared lions, tigers, and other wild beasts, which surrounded the castle, and thousands and thousands of beasts came out of the castle following their king, the Seven-headed Serpent  The Serpent glided over the clothes which were spread for him, came to the Lake, and asked it who had strewed those soft things on the path? The Lake answered that it had been done by people who had come to do him homage  The King commanded that the men should be brought before him  They came humbly on their knees, and in a few words told him their story', " Then he spoke to them with a mighty and terrible voice, and said, 'Because you have dared to come here, I lay upon you the punishment", ' Every year you must bring me from among your people twelve youths and twelve maidens, that I may devour them  If you do not do this, I will destroy your whole nation', "' Then he desired one of his beasts to show the men the way out of the garden, and dismissed them", ' They then left the island and went back to their own country, where they related what had happened to them  Soon the time came round when the king of the beasts would expect the youths and maidens to be brought to him  The King therefore issued a proclamation inviting twelve youths and twelve maidens to offer themselves up to save their country; and immediately many young people, far more than enough, hastened to do so  A new ship was built, and set with black sails, and in it the youths and maidens who were appointed for the king of the beasts embarked and set out for his country  When they arrived there they went at once to the Lake, and this time the lions did not stir, nor did the springs flow, and neither did the Lake speak  So they waited then, and it was not long before the earth quaked even more terribly than the first time  THERE was once upon a time a couple of poor folks who lived in a wretched hut, far away from everyone else, in a wood  They only just managed to live from hand to mouth, and had great difficulty in doing even so much as that, but they had three sons, and the youngest of them was called Cinderlad, for he did nothing else but lie and poke about among the ashes  One day the eldest lad said that he would go out to earn his living; he soon got leave to do that, and set out on his way into the world  He walked on and on for the whole day, and when night was beginning to fall he came to a royal palace  The King was standing outside on the steps, and asked where he was going', " 'Oh, I am going about seeking a place, my father,' said the youth", " 'Wilt thou serve me, and watch my seven foals?' asked the King", " 'If thou canst watch them for a whole day and tell me at night what they eat and drink, thou shalt have the Princess and half my kingdom, but if thou canst not, I will cut three red stripes on thy back", "' The youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the foals, and that he could do it well enough", " Next morning, when day was beginning to dawn, the King's Master of the Horse let out the seven foals; and they ran away, and the youth after them just as it chanced, over hill and dale, through woods end bogs", ' When the youth had run thus for a long time he began to be tired, and when he had held on a little longer he was heartily weary of watching at all, and at the same moment he came to a cleft in a rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with her distaff in her hand', " As soon as she caught sight of the youth, who was running after the foals till the perspiration streamed down his face, she cried: 'Come hither, come hither, my handsome son, and let me comb your hair for you", "' The lad was willing enough, so he sat down in the cleft of the rock beside the old hag, and laid his head on her knees, and she combed his hair all day while he lay there and gave himself up to idleness", ' When evening was drawing near, the youth wanted to go', " 'I may just as well go straight home again,' said he, 'for it is no use to go to the King's palace", "' 'Wait till it is dusk,' said the old hag, 'and then the King's foals will pass by this place again, and you can run home with them; no one will ever know that you have been lying here all day instead of watching the foals", "' So when they came she gave the lad a bottle of water and a bit of moss, and told him to show these to the King and say that this was what his seven foals ate and drank", " 'Hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long?' said the King, when the lad came into his presence in the evening", " 'Yes, that I have!' said the youth", " 'Then you are able to tell me what it is that my seven foals eat and drink,' said the King", " So the youth produced the bottle of water and the bit of moss which he had got from the old woman, saying: 'Here you see their meat, and here you see their drink", "' Then the King knew how his watching had been done, and fell into such a rage that he ordered his people to chase the youth back to his own home at once; but first they were to cut three red stripes in his back, and rub salt into them", ' When the youth reached home again, anyone can imagine what a state of mind he was in  He had gone out once to seek a place, he said, but never would he do such a thing again  Next day the second son said that he would now go out into the world to seek his fortune', " His father and mother said 'No,' and bade him look at his brother's back, but the youth would not give up his design, and stuck to it, and after a long, long time he got leave to go, and set forth on his way", " When he had walked all day he too came to the King's palace, and the King was standing outside on the steps, and asked where he was going; and when the youth replied that he was going about in search of a place, the King said that he might enter into his service and watch his seven foals", ' Then the King promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother', " The youth at once consented to this and entered into the King's service, for he thought he could easily watch the foals and inform the King what they ate and drank", ' In the grey light of dawn the Master of the Horse let out the seven foals, and off they went again over hill and dale, and off went the lad after them  In the times of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in Bagdad a poor porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day was sent to carry a heavy load from one end of the city to the other  Before he had accomplished half the distance he was so tired that, finding himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled with rose water, and a cool breeze was blowing, he set his burden upon the ground, and sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house  Very soon he decided that he could not have chosen a pleasanter place; a delicious perfume of aloes wood and pastilles came from the open windows and mingled with the scent of the rose water which steamed up from the hot pavement  Within the palace he heard some music, as of many instruments cunningly played, and the melodious warble of nightingales and other birds, and by this, and the appetising smell of many dainty dishes of which he presently became aware, he judged that feasting and merry making were going on  He wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he had never seen before, the street in which it stood being one which he seldom had occasion to pass  To satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly dressed servants who stood at the door, and asked one of them the name of the master of the mansion  "What," replied he, "do you live in Bagdad, and not know that here lives the noble Sindbad the Sailor, that famous traveller who sailed over every sea upon which the sun shines?" The porter, who had often heard people speak of the immense wealth of Sindbad, could not help feeling envious of one whose lot seemed to be as happy as his own was miserable  Casting his eyes up to the sky he exclaimed aloud, "Consider, Mighty Creator of all things, the differences between Sindbad\'s life and mine  Every day I suffer a thousand hardships and misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barley bread to keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbad spends money right and left and lives upon the fat of the land! What has he done that you should give him this pleasant life--what have I done to deserve so hard a fate?" So saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself with misery and despair  Just at this moment a servant came out of the palace, and taking him by the arm said, "Come with me, the noble Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you " Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons, and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad, so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street  However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of, and urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to yield  He followed the servant into a vast room, where a great company was seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies  In the place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long white beard gave him a venerable air  Behind his chair stood a crowd of attendants eager to minister to his wants  This was the famous Sindbad himself  The porter, more than ever alarmed at the sight of so much magnificence, tremblingly saluted the noble company  Sindbad, making a sign to him to approach, caused him to be seated at his right hand, and himself heaped choice morsels upon his plate, and poured out for him a draught of excellent wine, and presently, when the banquet drew to a close, spoke to him familiarly, asking his name and occupation  "My lord," replied the porter, "I am called Hindbad " "I am glad to see you here," continued Sindbad  "And I will answer for the rest of the company that they are equally pleased, but I wish you to tell me what it was that you said just now in the street " For Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast began, had heard his complaint and therefore had sent for him  At this question Hindbad was covered with confusion, and hanging down his head, replied, "My lord, I confess that, overcome by weariness and ill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray you to pardon me " "Oh!" replied Sindbad, "do not imagine that I am so unjust as to blame you  On the contrary, I understand your situation and can pity you  Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right  You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the wealth and luxury that you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger, but this is far indeed from being the case  I have only reached this happy state after having for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger  "Yes, my noble friends," he continued, addressing the company, "I assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter even the most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the seas  Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my seven voyages, and the dangers and wonders that I have met with by sea and land, I will now give you a full and true account of them, which I think you will be well pleased to hear  It is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough! there the people become quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the HOTTEST lands they are burnt to Negroes  But now it was only to the HOT lands that a learned man had come from the cold; there he thought that he could run about just as when at home, but he soon found out his mistake  He, and all sensible folks, were obliged to stay within doors--the window-shutters and doors were closed the whole day; it looked as if the whole house slept, or there was no one at home  The narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine must fall there from morning till evening--it was really not to be borne  The learned man from the cold lands--he was a young man, and seemed to be a clever man--sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he became quite meagre--even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also an effect on it  It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that they began to freshen up again  In the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on all the balconies in the street--for one must have air, even if one be accustomed to be mahogany! It was lively both up and down the street  Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the street--chairs and tables were brought forth--and candles burnt--yes, above a thousand lights were burning--and the one talked and the other sung; and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along with a dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on  The street boys were screaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and detonating balls--and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers--for there were funerals with psalm and hymn--and then the din of carriages driving and company arriving: yes, it was, in truth, lively enough down in the street', " Only in that single house, which stood opposite that in which the learned foreigner lived, it was quite still; and yet some one lived there, for there stood flowers in the balcony--they grew so well in the sun's heat! and that they could not do unless they were watered--and some one must water them--there must be somebody there", ' The door opposite was also opened late in the evening, but it was dark within, at least in the front room; further in there was heard the sound of music  The learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous, but now--it might be that he only imagined it--for he found everything marvellous out there, in the warm lands, if there had only been no sun', " The stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house opposite, one saw no person about, and as to the music, it appeared to him to be extremely tiresome", ' "It is as if some one sat there, and practised a piece that he could not master--always the same piece', " 'I shall master it!' says he; but yet he cannot master it, however long he plays", '" The word mahogany can be understood, in Danish, as having two meanings  In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself; but in jest, it signifies "excessively fine," which arose from an anecdote of Nyboder, in Copenhagen, (the seamen\'s quarter', ") A sailor's wife, who was always proud and fine, in her way, came to her neighbor, and complained that she had got a splinter in her finger", ' "What of?" asked the neighbor\'s wife  "It is a mahogany splinter," said the other  "Mahogany! It cannot be less with you!" exclaimed the woman--and thence the proverb, "It is so mahogany!"--(that is, so excessively fine)--is derived', " One night the stranger awoke--he slept with the doors of the balcony open--the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought that a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the flowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the midst of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden--it was as if she also shone; the light really hurt his eyes", ' He now opened them quite wide--yes, he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the floor; he crept gently behind the curtain, but the maiden was gone; the flowers shone no longer, but there they stood, fresh and blooming as ever; the door was ajar, and, far within, the music sounded so soft and delightful, one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it  Yet it was like a piece of enchantment  And who lived there? Where was the actual entrance? The whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops, and there people could not always be running through  One evening the stranger sat out on the balcony', " The light burnt in the room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should fall on his opposite neighbor's wall", ' Yes! there it sat, directly opposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger moved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does  "I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there," said the learned man  "See, how nicely it sits between the flowers The Shee an Gannon was born in the morning, named at noon, and went in the evening to ask his daughter of the king of Erin  "I will give you my daughter in marriage," said the king of Erin; "you won\'t get her, though, unless you go and bring me back the tidings that I want, and tell me what it is that put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach Gaire, who before this laughed always, and laughed so loud that the whole world heard him  There are twelve iron spikes out here in the garden behind my castle', " On eleven of the spikes are the heads of kings' sons who came seeking my daughter in marriage, and all of them went away to get the knowledge I wanted", ' Not one was able to get it and tell me what stopped the Gruagach Gaire from laughing', " I took the heads off them all when they came back without the tidings for which they went, and I'm greatly in dread that your head'll be on the twelfth spike, for I'll do the same to you that I did to the eleven kings' sons unless you tell what put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach", '" The Shee an Gannon made no answer, but left the king and pushed away to know could he find why the Gruagach was silent  He took a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and travelled all day till evening  Then he came to a house  The master of the house asked him what sort was he, and he said: "A young man looking for hire " "Well," said the master of the house, "I was going tomorrow to look for a man to mind my cows', " If you'll work for me, you'll have a good place, the best food a man could have to eat in this world, and a soft bed to lie on", '" The Shee an Gannon took service, and ate his supper  Then the master of the house said: "I am the Gruagach Gaire; now that you are my man and have eaten your supper, you\'ll have a bed of silk to sleep on " Next morning after breakfast the Gruagach said to the Shee an Gannon: "Go out now and loosen my five golden cows and my bull without horns, and drive them to pasture; but when you have them out on the grass, be careful you don\'t let them go near the land of the giant " The new cowboy drove the cattle to pasture, and when near the land of the giant, he saw it was covered with woods and surrounded by a high wall  He went up, put his back against the wall, and threw in a great stretch of it; then he went inside and threw out another great stretch of the wall, and put the five golden cows and the bull without horns on the land of the giant  Then he climbed a tree, ate the sweet apples himself, and threw the sour ones down to the cattle of the Gruagach Gaire  Soon a great crashing was heard in the woods,--the noise of young trees bending, and old trees breaking  The cowboy looked around and saw a five-headed giant pushing through the trees; and soon he was before him  "Poor miserable creature!" said the giant; "but weren\'t you impudent to come to my land and trouble me in this way? You\'re too big for one bite, and too small for two', " I don't know what to do but tear you to pieces", '" "You nasty brute," said the cowboy, coming down to him from the tree, "\'tis little I care for you;" and then they went at each other  So great was the noise between them that there was nothing in the world but what was looking on and listening to the combat  They fought till late in the afternoon, when the giant was getting the upper hand; and then the cowboy thought that if the giant should kill him, his father and mother would never find him or set eyes on him again, and he would never get the daughter of the king of Erin  The heart in his body grew strong at this thought  He sprang on the giant, and with the first squeeze and thrust he put him to his knees in the hard ground, with the second thrust to his waist, and with the third to his shoulders  "I have you at last; you\'re done for now!", said the cowboy  Then he took out his knife, cut the five heads off the giant, and when he had them off he cut out the tongues and threw the heads over the wall  Then he put the tongues in his pocket and drove home the cattle Have you ever seen an old wooden cupboard quite black with age, and ornamented with carved foliage and curious figures? Well, just such a cupboard stood in a parlor, and had been left to the family as a legacy by the great-grandmother', " It was covered from top to bottom with carved roses and tulips; the most curious scrolls were drawn upon it, and out of them peeped little stags' heads, with antlers", ' In the middle of the cupboard door was the carved figure of a man most ridiculous to look at  He grinned at you, for no one could call it laughing  He had goat\'s legs, little horns on his head, and a long beard; the children in the room always called him, "Major general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat\'s-legs " It was certainly a very difficult name to pronounce, and there are very few who ever receive such a title, but then it seemed wonderful how he came to be carved at all; yet there he was, always looking at the table under the looking-glass, where stood a very pretty little shepherdess made of china  Her shoes were gilt, and her dress had a red rose or an ornament  She wore a hat, and carried a crook, that were both gilded, and looked very bright and pretty  Close by her side stood a little chimney-sweep, as black as coal, and also made of china  He was, however, quite as clean and neat as any other china figure; he only represented a black chimney-sweep, and the china workers might just as well have made him a prince, had they felt inclined to do so', " He stood holding his ladder quite handily, and his face was as fair and rosy as a girl's; indeed, that was rather a mistake, it should have had some black marks on it", ' He and the shepherdess had been placed close together, side by side; and, being so placed, they became engaged to each other, for they were very well suited, being both made of the same sort of china, and being equally fragile  Close to them stood another figure, three times as large as they were, and also made of china  He was an old Chinaman, who could nod his head, and used to pretend that he was the grandfather of the shepherdess, although he could not prove it  He however assumed authority over her, and therefore when "Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat\'s-legs" asked for the little shepherdess to be his wife, he nodded his head to show that he consented  "You will have a husband," said the old Chinaman to her, "who I really believe is made of mahogany', " He will make you a lady of Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs", ' He has the whole cupboard full of silver plate, which he keeps locked up in secret drawers " "I won\'t go into the dark cupboard," said the little shepherdess  "I have heard that he has eleven china wives there already " "Then you shall be the twelfth," said the old Chinaman  "To-night as soon as you hear a rattling in the old cupboard, you shall be married, as true as I am a Chinaman;" and then he nodded his head and fell asleep  Then the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her sweetheart, the china chimney-sweep  "I must entreat you," said she, "to go out with me into the wide world, for we cannot stay here " "I will do whatever you wish," said the little chimney-sweep; "let us go immediately: I think I shall be able to maintain you with my profession " "If we were but safely down from the table!" said she; "I shall not be happy till we are really out in the world " Then he comforted her, and showed her how to place her little foot on the carved edge and gilt-leaf ornaments of the table  He brought his little ladder to help her, and so they contrived to reach the floor  But when they looked at the old cupboard, they saw it was all in an uproar  The carved stags pushed out their heads, raised their antlers, and twisted their necks  Up in the Black Mountains in Caermarthenshire lies the lake known as Lyn y Van Vach  To the margin of this lake the shepherd of Myddvai once led his lambs, and lay there whilst they sought pasture  Suddenly, from the dark waters of the lake, he saw three maidens rise  Shaking the bright drops from their hair and gliding to the shore, they wandered about amongst his flock  They had more than mortal beauty, and he was filled with love for her that came nearest to him', " He offered her the bread he had with him, and she took it and tried it, but then sang to him:  Hard-baked is thy bread,  'Tis not easy to catch me, and then ran off laughing to the lake", ' Next day he took with him bread not so well done, and watched for the maidens  When they came ashore he offered his bread as before, and the maiden tasted it and sang:  Unbaked is thy bread,  I will not have thee, and again disappeared in the waves  A third time did the shepherd of Myddvai try to attract the maiden, and this time he offered her bread that he had found floating about near the shore  This pleased her, and she promised to become his wife if he were able to pick her out from among her sisters on the following day  When the time came the shepherd knew his love by the strap of her sandal  Then she told him she would be as good a wife to him as any earthly maiden could be unless he should strike her three times without cause  Of course he deemed that this could never be; and she, summoning from the lake three cows, two oxen, and a bull, as her marriage portion, was led homeward by him as his bride  The years passed happily, and three children were born to the shepherd and the lake-maiden  But one day here were going to a christening, and she said to her husband it was far to walk, so he told her to go for the horses  "I will," said she, "if you bring me my gloves which I\'ve left in the house " But when he came back with the gloves, he found she had not gone for the horses; so he tapped her lightly on the shoulder with the gloves, and said, "Go, go " "That\'s one," said she  Another time they were at a wedding, when suddenly the lake-maiden fell a-sobbing and a-weeping, amid the joy and mirth of all around her  Her husband tapped her on the shoulder, and asked her, "Why do you weep?" "Because they are entering into trouble; and trouble is upon you; for that is the second causeless blow you have given me  Be careful; the third is the last " The husband was careful never to strike her again  But one day at a funeral she suddenly burst out into fits of laughter  Her husband forgot, and touched her rather roughly on the shoulder, saying, "Is this a time for laughter?" "I laugh," she said, "because those that die go out of trouble, but your trouble has come  The last blow has been struck; our marriage is at an end, and so farewell " And with that she rose up and left the house and went to their home', " Then she, looking round upon her home, called to the cattle she had brought with her:  Brindle cow, white speckled,  Spotted cow, bold freckled,  Old white face, and gray Geringer,  And the white bull from the king's coast,  Grey ox, and black calf,  All, all, follow me home, Now the black calf had just been slaughtered, and was hanging on the hook; but it got off the hook alive and well and followed her; and the oxen, though they were ploughing, trailed the plough with them and did her bidding", ' So she fled to the lake again, they following her, and with them plunged into the dark waters  And to this day is the furrow seen which the plough left as it was dragged across the mountains to the tarn  Only once did she come again, when her sons were grown to manhood, and then she gave them gifts of healing by which they won the name of Meddygon Myddvai, the physicians of Myddvai  In the land of Erin there dwelt long ago a widow who had an only son  He was a clever boy, so she saved up enough money to send him to school, and, as soon as he was old enough, to apprentice him to any trade that he would choose  But when the time came, he said he would not be bound to any trade, and that he meant to be a thief  Now his mother was very sorrowful when she heard of this, but she knew quite well that if she tried to stop his having his own way he would only grow more determined to get it  So all the answer she made was that the end of thieves was hanging at the bridge of Dublin, and then she left him alone, hoping that when he was older he might become more sensible  One day she was going to church to hear a sermon from a great preacher, and she begged the Shifty Lad, as the neighbours called him from the tricks he played, to come with her', " But he only laughed and declared that he did not like sermons, adding: 'However, I will promise you this, that the first trade you hear named after you come out from church shall be my trade for the rest of my life", "' These words gave a little comfort to the poor woman, and her heart was lighter than before as she bade him farewell", " When the Shifty Lad thought that the hour had nearly come for the sermon to be over, he hid himself in some bushes in a little path that led straight to his mother's house, and, as she passed along, thinking of all the good things she had heard, a voice shouted close to her ear 'Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!' The suddenness of it made her jump", ' The naughty boy had managed to change his voice, so that she did not know it for his, and he had concealed himself so well that, though she peered about all round her, she could see no one  As soon as she had turned the corner the Shifty Lad came out, and by running very fast through the wood he contrived to reach home before his mother, who found him stretched out comfortably before the fire', " 'Well, have you got any news to tell me?' asked he", " 'No, nothing; for I left the church at once, and did not stop to speak to anyone", "' 'Oh, then no one has mentioned a trade to you?' he said in tones of disappointment", " 'Ye--es,' she replied slowly", ' \'At least, as I walked down the path a voice cried out "Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!" but that was all', "' 'And quite enough too,' answered the boy", " 'What did I tell you? That is going to be my trade", "' 'Then your end will be hanging at the bridge of Dublin,' said she", ' But there was no sleep for her that night, for she lay in the dark thinking about her son', " 'If he is to be a thief at all, he had better be a good one", " And who is there that can teach him?' the mother asked herself", ' But an idea came to her, and she arose early, before the sun was up, and set off for the home of the Black Rogue, or Gallows Bird, who was such a wonderful thief that, though all had been robbed by him, no one could catch him', " 'Good-morning to you,' said the woman as she reached the place where the Black Gallows Bird lived when he was not away on his business", " 'My son has a fancy to learn your trade", " Will you be kind enough to teach him?' 'If he is clever, I don't mind trying,' answered the Black Gallows Bird; 'and, of course, if ANY one can turn him into a first-rate thief, it is I", " But if he is stupid, it is of no use at all; I can't bear stupid people", "' 'No, he isn't stupid,' said the woman with a sigh", " 'So to-night, after dark, I will send him to you", "' The Shifty Lad jumped for joy when his mother told him where she had been" ,  ' There was once a fine gentleman whose entire worldly possessions consisted of a boot-jack and a hair-brush; but he had the most beautiful shirt-collar in the world, and it is about this that we are going to hear a story  The shirt-collar was so old that he began to think about marrying; and it happened one day that he and a garter came into the wash-tub together', " 'Hulloa!' said the shirt-collar, 'never before have I seen anything so slim and delicate, so elegant and pretty! May I be permitted to ask your name?' 'I shan't tell you,' said the garter", " 'Where is the place of your abode?' asked the shirt-collar", ' But the garter was of a bashful disposition, and did not think it proper to answer', " 'Perhaps you are a girdle?' said the shirt-collar, 'an under girdle? for I see that you are for use as well as for ornament, my pretty miss!' 'You ought not to speak to me!' said the garter' 'I'm sure I haven't given you any encouragement!' 'When anyone is as beautiful as you,' said the shirt-collar, 'is not that encouragement enough?' 'Go away, don't come so close!' said the garter", " 'You seem to be a gentleman!' 'So I am, and a very fine one too!' said the shirt-collar; 'I possess a boot-jack and a hair-brush!' That was not true; it was his master who owned these things; but he was a terrible boaster", " 'Don't come so close,' said the garter", " 'I'm not accustomed to such treatment!' 'What affectation!' said the shirt-collar", ' And then they were taken out of the wash-tub, starched, and hung on a chair in the sun to dry, and then laid on the ironing-board  Then came the glowing iron', " 'Mistress widow!' said the shirt-collar, 'dear mistress widow! I am becoming another man, all my creases are coming out; you are burning a hole in me! Ugh! Stop, I implore you!' 'You rag!' said the iron, travelling proudly over the shirt-collar, for it thought it was a steam engine and ought to be at the station drawing trucks", " 'Rag!' it said", ' The shirt-collar was rather frayed out at the edge, so the scissors came to cut off the threads', " 'Oh!' said the shirt-collar, 'you must be a dancer! How high you can kick! That is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen! No man can imitate you!' 'I know that!' said the scissors", " 'You ought to be a duchess!' said the shirt-collar", " 'My worldly possessions consist of a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-brush", " If only I had a duchy!' 'What! He wants to marry me?' said the scissors, and she was so angry that she gave the collar a sharp snip, so that it had to be cast aside as good for nothing", " 'Well, I shall have to propose to the hair-brush!' thought the shirt-collar", " 'It is really wonderful what fine hair you have, madam! Have you never thought of marrying?' 'Yes, that I have!' answered the hair-brush; 'I'm engaged to the boot-jack!' 'Engaged!' exclaimed the shirt-collar", ' And now there was no one he could marry, so he took to despising matrimony  Time passed, and the shirt-collar came in a rag-bag to the paper-mill  There was a large assortment of rags, the fine ones in one heap, and the coarse ones in another, as they should be  They had all much to tell, but no one more than the shirt-collar, for he was a hopeless braggart', " 'I have had a terrible number of love affairs!' he said", " 'They give me no peace", ' I was such a fine gentleman, so stiff with starch! I had a boot-jack and a hair-brush, which I never used! You should just have seen me then! Never shall I forget my first love! She was a girdle, so delicate and soft and pretty! She threw herself into a wash-tub for my sake! Then there was a widow, who glowed with love for me  But I left her alone, till she became black  Then there was the dancer, who inflicted the wound which has caused me to be here now; she was very violent! My own hair-brush was in love with me, and lost all her hair in consequence  Yes, I have experienced much in that line; but I grieve most of all for the garter,-I mean, the girdle, who threw herself into a wash-tub There was once a shilling, which came forth from the mint springing and shouting, "Hurrah! now I am going out into the wide world " And truly it did go out into the wide world  The children held it with warm hands, the miser with a cold and convulsive grasp, and the old people turned it about, goodness knows how many times, while the young people soon allowed it to roll away from them  The shilling was made of silver, it contained very little copper, and considered itself quite out in the world when it had been circulated for a year in the country in which it had been coined  One day, it really did go out into the world, for it belonged to a gentleman who was about to travel in foreign lands  This gentleman was not aware that the shilling lay at the bottom of his purse when he started, till he one day found it between his fingers  "Why," cried he, "here is a shilling from home; well, it must go on its travels with me now!" and the shilling jumped and rattled for joy, when it was put back again into the purse  Here it lay among a number of foreign companions, who were always coming and going, one taking the place of another, but the shilling from home was always put back, and had to remain in the purse, which was certainly a mark of distinction  Many weeks passed, during which the shilling had travelled a long distance in the purse, without in the least knowing where he was  He had found out that the other coins were French and Italian; and one coin said they were in this town, and another said they were in that, but the shilling was unable to make out or imagine what they meant', " A man certainly cannot see much of the world if he is tied up in a bag, and this was really the shilling's fate", ' But one day, as he was lying in the purse, he noticed that it was not quite closed, and so he slipped near to the opening to have a little peep into society  He certainly had not the least idea of what would follow, but he was curious, and curiosity often brings its own punishment  In his eagerness, he came so near the edge of the purse that he slipped out into the pocket of the trousers; and when, in the evening, the purse was taken out, the shilling was left behind in the corner to which it had fallen  As the clothes were being carried into the hall, the shilling fell out on the floor, unheard and unnoticed by any one  The next morning the clothes were taken back to the room, the gentleman put them on, and started on his journey again; but the shilling remained behind on the floor  After a time it was found, and being considered a good coin, was placed with three other coins  "Ah," thought the shilling, "this is pleasant; I shall now see the world, become acquainted with other people, and learn other customs " "Do you call that a shilling?" said some one the next moment  "That is not a genuine coin of the country,--it is false; it is good for nothing " Now begins the story as it was afterwards related by the shilling himself  "\'False! good for nothing!\' said he  That remark went through and through me like a dagger  I knew that I had a true ring, and that mine was a genuine stamp  These people must at all events be wrong, or they could not mean me', " But yes, I was the one they called 'false, and good for nothing", '\' "\'Then I must pay it away in the dark,\' said the man who had received me  So I was to be got rid of in the darkness, and be again insulted in broad daylight  "\'False! good for nothing!\' Oh, I must contrive to get lost, thought I  And I trembled between the fingers of the people every time they tried to pass me off slyly as a coin of the country  A long time ago there lived a young prince whose favourite playfellow was the son of the gardener who lived in the grounds of the palace', " The king would have preferred his choosing a friend from the pages who were brought up at court; but the prince would have nothing to say to them, and as he was a spoilt child, and allowed his way in all things, and the gardener's boy was quiet and well-behaved, he was suffered to be in the palace, morning, noon, and night", ' The game the children loved the best was a match at archery, for the king had given them two bows exactly alike, and they would spend whole days in trying to see which could shoot the highest  This is always very dangerous, and it was a great wonder they did not put their eyes out; but somehow or other they managed to escape  One morning, when the prince had done his lessons, he ran out to call his friend, and they both hurried off to the lawn which was their usual playground  They took their bows out of the little hut where their toys were kept, and began to see which could shoot the highest  At last they happened to let fly their arrows both together, and when they fell to earth again the tail feather of a golden hen was found sticking in one  Now the question began to arise whose was the lucky arrow, for they were both alike, and look as closely as you would you could see no difference between them', " The prince declared that the arrow was his, and the gardener's boy was quite sure it was HIS--and on this occasion he was perfectly right; but, as they could not decide the matter, they went straight to the king", ' When the king had heard the story, he decided that the feather belonged to his son; but the other boy would not listen to this and claimed the feather for himself', " At length the king's patience gave way, and he said angrily: 'Very well; if you are so sure that the feather is yours, yours it shall be; only you will have to seek till you find a golden hen with a feather missing from her tail", ' And if you fail to find her your head will be the forfeit', "' The boy had need of all his courage to listen silently to the king's words", ' He had no idea where the golden hen might be, or even, if he discovered that, how he was to get to her', " But there was nothing for it but to do the king's bidding, and he felt that the sooner he left the palace the better", ' So he went home and put some food into a bag, and then set forth, hoping that some accident might show him which path to take  After walking for several hours he met a fox, who seemed inclined to be friendly, and the boy was so glad to have anyone to talk to that he sat down and entered into conversation', " 'Where are you going?' asked the fox", " 'I have got to find a golden hen who has lost a feather out of her tail,' answered the boy; 'but I don't know where she lives or how I shall catch her!' 'Oh, I can show you the way!' said the fox, who was really very good-natured", ' \'Far towards the east, in that direction, lives a beautiful maiden who is called "The Sister of the Sun " She has three golden hens in her house  Perhaps the feather belongs to one of them', "' The boy was delighted at this news, and they walked on all day together, the fox in front, and the boy behind", ' When evening came they lay down to sleep, and put the knapsack under their heads for a pillow  Suddenly, about midnight, the fox gave a low whine, and drew nearer to his bedfellow', " 'Cousin,' he whispered very low, 'there is someone coming who will take the knapsack away from me", " Look over there!' And the boy, peeping through the bushes, saw a man", " 'Oh, I don't think he will rob us!' said the boy; and when the man drew near, he told them his story, which so much interested the stranger that he asked leave to travel with them, as he might be of some use", ' So when the sun rose they set out again, the fox in front as before, the man and boy following  After some hours they reached the castle of the Sister of the Sun, who kept the golden hens among her treasures  Once upon a time there lived a man who dwelt with his wife in a little hut, far away from any neighbours  But they did not mind being alone, and would have been quite happy, if it had not been for a marten, who came every night to their poultry yard, and carried off one of their fowls  The man laid all sorts of traps to catch the thief, but instead of capturing the foe, it happened that one day he got caught himself, and falling down, struck his head against a stone, and was killed  Not long after the marten came by on the look out for his supper', " Seeing the dead man lying there, he said to himself: 'That is a prize, this time I have done well'; and dragging the body with great difficulty to the sledge which was waiting for him, drove off with his booty", " He had not driven far when he met a squirrel, who bowed and said: 'Good-morning, godfather! what have you got behind you?' The marten laughed and answered: 'Did you ever hear anything so strange? The old man that you see here set traps about his hen-house, thinking to catch me but he fell into his own trap, and broke his own neck", ' He is very heavy; I wish you would help me to draw the sledge', "' The squirrel did as he was asked, and the sledge moved slowly along", ' By-and-by a hare came running across a field, but stopped to see what wonderful thing was coming', " 'What have you got there?' she asked, and the marten told his story and begged the hare to help them pull", ' The hare pulled her hardest, and after a while they were joined by a fox, and then by a wolf, and at length a bear was added to the company, and he was of more use than all the other five beasts put together  Besides, when the whole six had supped off the man he was not so heavy to draw', " The worst of it was that they soon began to get hungry again, and the wolf, who was the hungriest of all, said to the rest: 'What shall we eat now, my friends, as there is no more man?' 'I suppose we shall have to eat the smallest of us,' replied the bear, and the marten turned round to seize the squirrel who was much smaller than any of the rest", ' But the squirrel ran up a tree like lightning, and the marten remembering, just in time, that he was the next in size, slipped quick as thought into a hole in the rocks', " 'What shall we eat now?' asked the wolf again, when he had recovered from his surprise", " 'We must eat the smallest of us,' repeated the bear, stretching out a paw towards the hare; but the hare was not a hare for nothing, and before the paw had touched her, she had darted deep into the wood", ' Now that the squirrel, the marten, and the hare had all gone, the fox was the smallest of the three who were left, and the wolf and the bear explained that they were very sorry, but they would have to eat him', " Michael, the fox, did not run away as the others had done, but smiled in a friendly manner, and remarked: 'Things taste so stale in a valley; one's appetite is so much better up on a mountain", "' The wolf and the bear agreed, and they turned out of the hollow where they had been walking, and chose a path that led up the mountain side", " The fox trotted cheerfully by his two big companions, but on the way he managed to whisper to the wolf: 'Tell me, Peter, when I am eaten, what will you have for your next dinner?' This simple question seemed to put out the wolf very much", ' What would they have for their next dinner, and, what was more important still, who would there be to eat it? They had made a rule always to dine off the smallest of the party, and when the fox was gone, why of course, he was smaller than the bear', " These thoughts flashed quickly through his head, and he said hastily: 'Dear brothers, would it not be better for us to live together as comrades, and everyone to hunt for the common dinner? Is not my plan a good one?' 'It is the best thing I have ever heard,' answered the fox; and as they were two to one the bear had to be content, though in his heart he would much have preferred a good dinner at once to any friendship", ' For a few days all went well; there was plenty of game in the forest, and even the wolf had as much to eat as he could wish', " One morning the fox as usual was going his rounds when he noticed a tall, slender tree, with a magpie's nest in one of the top branches", ' Now the fox was particularly fond of young magpies, and he set about making a plan by which he could have one for dinner  At last he hit upon something which he thought would do, and accordingly he sat down near the tree and began to stare hard at it', " 'What are you looking at, Michael?' asked the magpie, who was watching him from a bough", " 'I'm looking at this tree", ' It has just struck me what a good tree it would be to cut my new snow-shoes out of', "' But at this answer the magpie screeched loudly, and exclaimed: 'Oh, not this tree, dear brother, I implore you! I have built my nest on it, and my young ones are not yet old enough to fly" ,  ' ONCE upon a time there was a young girl who reached the age of thirty-seven without ever having had a lover, for she was so foolish that no one wanted to marry her  One day, however, a young man arrived to pay his addresses to her, and her mother, beaming with joy, sent her daughter down to the cellar to draw a jug of beer  As the girl never came back the mother went down to see what had become of her, and found her sitting on the stairs, her head in her hands, while by her side the beer was running all over the floor, as she had forgotten to close the tap', " 'What are you doing there?' asked the mother", " 'I was thinking what I shall call my first child after I am married to that young man", ' All the names in the calendar are taken already', "' The mother sat down on the staircase beside her daughter and said, 'I will think about it with you, my dear", "' The father who had stayed upstairs with the young man was surprised that neither his wife nor his daughter came back, and in his turn went down to look for them", ' He found them both sitting on the stairs, while beside them the beer was running all over the ground from the tap, which was wide open', " 'What are you doing there? The beer is running all over the cellar", "' 'We were thinking what we should call the children that our daughter will have when she marries that young man", ' All the names in the calendar are taken already', "' 'Well,' said the father, 'I will think about it with you", "' As neither mother nor daughter nor father came upstairs again, the lover grew impatient, and went down into the cellar to see what they could all be doing", ' He found them all three sitting on the stairs, while beside them the beer was running all over the ground from the tap, which was wide open', " 'What in the world are you all doing that you don't come upstairs, and that you let the beer run all over the cellar?' 'Yes, I know, my boy,' said the father, 'but if you marry our daughter what shall you call your children? All the names in the calendar are taken", "' When the young man heard this answer he replied: 'Well! good-bye, I am going away", ' When I shall have found three people sillier than you I will come back and marry your daughter', "' So he continued his journey, and after walking a long way he reached an orchard", ' Then he saw some people knocking down walnuts, and trying to throw them into a cart with a fork', " 'What are you doing there?' he asked", " 'We want to load the cart with our walnuts, but we can't manage to do it", "' The lover advised them to get a basket and to put the walnuts in it, so as to turn them into the cart", " 'Well,' he said to himself, 'I have already found someone more foolish than those three", "' So he went on his way, and by-and-by he came to a wood", ' There he saw a man who wanted to give his pig some acorns to eat, and was trying with all his might to make him climb up the oak-tree', " 'What are you doing, my good man?' asked he", " 'I want to make my pig eat some acorns, and I can't get him to go up the tree", "' 'If you were to climb up and shake down the acorns the pig would pick them up", "' 'Oh, I never thought of that" ,  ' A king was once hunting in a great wood, and he hunted the game so eagerly that none of his courtiers could follow him  When evening came on he stood still and looked round him, and he saw that he had quite lost himself  He sought a way out, but could find none  Then he saw an old woman with a shaking head coming towards him; but she was a witch', " 'Good woman,' he said to her, 'can you not show me the way out of the wood?' 'Oh, certainly, Sir King,' she replied, 'I can quite well do that, but on one condition, which if you do not fulfil you will never get out of the wood, and will die of hunger", "' 'What is the condition?' asked the King", " 'I have a daughter,' said the old woman, 'who is so beautiful that she has not her equal in the world, and is well fitted to be your wife; if you will make her lady-queen I will show you the way out of the wood", "' The King in his anguish of mind consented, and the old woman led him to her little house where her daughter was sitting by the fire", ' She received the King as if she were expecting him, and he saw that she was certainly very beautiful; but she did not please him, and he could not look at her without a secret feeling of horror  As soon as he had lifted the maiden on to his horse the old woman showed him the way, and the King reached his palace, where the wedding was celebrated  The King had already been married once, and had by his first wife seven children, six boys and one girl, whom he loved more than anything in the world  And now, because he was afraid that their stepmother might not treat them well and might do them harm, he put them in a lonely castle that stood in the middle of a wood  It lay so hidden, and the way to it was so hard to find, that he himself could not have found it out had not a wise-woman given him a reel of thread which possessed a marvellous property: when he threw it before him it unwound itself and showed him the way  But the King went so often to his dear children that the Queen was offended at his absence  She grew curious, and wanted to know what he had to do quite alone in the wood  She gave his servants a great deal of money, and they betrayed the secret to her, and also told her of the reel which alone could point out the way  She had no rest now till she had found out where the King guarded the reel, and then she made some little white shirts, and, as she had learnt from her witch-mother, sewed an enchantment in each of them  And when the King had ridden off she took the little shirts and went into the wood, and the reel showed her the way  The children, who saw someone coming in the distance, thought it was their dear father coming to them, and sprang to meet him very joyfully  Then she threw over each one a little shirt, which when it had touched their bodies changed them into swans, and they flew away over the forest  The Queen went home quite satisfied, and thought she had got rid of her step-children; but the girl had not run to meet her with her brothers, and she knew nothing of her  The next day the King came to visit his children, but he found no one but the girl', " 'Where are your brothers?' asked the King", " 'Alas! dear father,' she answered, 'they have gone away and left me all alone", "' And she told him that looking out of her little window she had seen her brothers flying over the wood in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers which they had let fall in the yard, and which she had collected", ' The King mourned, but he did not think that the Queen had done the wicked deed, and as he was afraid the maiden would also be taken from him, he wanted to take her with him  But she was afraid of the stepmother, and begged the King to let her stay just one night more in the castle in the wood', " The poor maiden thought, 'My home is no longer here; I will go and seek my brothers", "' And when night came she fled away into the forest", ' She ran all through the night and the next day, till she could go no farther for weariness  Ahmed was the only child of the wealthiest merchant in Damascus  His father devoted his days to doing everything possible to anticipate his wishes', " The boy returned his father's love with interest, and the two lived together in the utmost happiness", ' They were seldom apart, the father curtailing his business journeys so that he could hastily return to Damascus, and finally restricting his affairs to those which he could perform in his own home', " For safety's sake, Ahmed, whenever he was out of his father's sight, was attended, by a big negro slave, Pedro, an imposing looking person, richly attired as befitted his station and duties", ' Pedro was a faithful servant, and he and Ahmed were the firmest friends  When Ahmed grew up to be a youth, his father decided to send him to Jerusalem to be educated  He did so reluctantly, knowing, however, that it was the wisest course to adopt Gently he broke the news to Ahmed, for he knew the latter would dislike to leave home  Ahmed was truly sorry to have to be parted from his father, but he kept back his tears and said bravely: "It is thy wish, father, therefore I question it not  I know that thou desirest only my welfare " "Well spoken, my son," said his father  "May I take Pedro with me?" asked Ahmed  "Nay, that would not be seemly," answered his father, gently  "It would make thee appear anxious to display thy wealth  Such ostentation will induce people to regard thee and thy father as foolish persons, possessed of more wealth than is good for the exercise of wisdom  Also, my son, thy future teaching must be not confined to the learning that wise men can impart unto thee  Thou art going to the great city to learn the ways of the world, to train thyself in self-reliance, and to prepare thyself for all the duties of manhood " The youth was somewhat disappointed to hear this  It was the first occasion, as far as his memory served him, that his father had failed to grant his wish; but he was nevertheless flattered by the prospect of quickly becoming a man, and he answered, "I bow to thy wisdom, my father " He left for Jerusalem, after bidding the merchant an affectionate farewell, and in the Holy City he applied himself diligently to his studies  He delighted his teachers with his cheerful attention to his lessons, and discovered a new source of happiness in learning things for himself from observation  Also, it was a pleasant sensation to conduct his own affairs, and in the great city, with its busy narrow thoroughfares and its wonderful buildings, he daily grew less homesick  Regularly he received letters by messengers from his father, and dutifully he returned, by the same means, long epistles, setting out all the big and little things that made up his life  A year passed, and one day the usual message that Ahmed expected came to him in a strange hand-writing  He opened it hastily, with a foreboding of evil and alarm', " The writer of the letter was one of the merchant's closest friends", ' He said: "O worthy son of a most worthy father, greeting to thee, and may God give thee strength to hear the terrible and sad tidings which it is my sorrowful duty to convey unto thee  Know then that it hath pleased God in his wisdom to call from this earth thy saintly father, to sit with the righteous ones in Heaven  Here in the city of Damascus there is great weeping, for thy honored father was the most upright of men, a friend to all in distress, a man whose bounteous charity to the poor and unfortunate was unsurpassed  But our grief, deep and heartfelt as it is, cannot be compared to thine  Near a big river, and between two high mountains, a man and his wife lived in a cottage a long, long time ago  A dense forest lay all round the cottage, and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood  In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare, and many an hour the two passed together, when the man was resting by the roadside, eating his dinner  Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki, a wicked, quarrelsome beast, who hated the peasant, and was never tired of doing him an ill turn', " Again and again he had crept to the hut, and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare, had either eaten it if he thought it nice, or trampled it to pieces so that no one else should get it, and at last the peasant lost patience, and made up his mind he would have the Tanuki's blood", ' So for many days the man lay hidden, waiting for the Tanuki to come by, and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal, the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly, so that he could not move  Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house, feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns', " 'He shall pay for them with his skin,' he said to his wife", " 'We will first kill him, and then cook him", "' So saying, he hanged the Tanuki, head downwards, to a beam, and went out to gather wood for a fire", ' Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight  Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner, and, stopping her work, she looked round to see what it was  That was all that the rascal wanted, and he put on directly his most humble air, and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds, which her hurting him sorely  She was filled with pity for him, but did not dare to set him free, as she knew that her husband would be very angry  The Tanuki, however, did not despair, and seeing that her heart was softened, began his prayers anew', " 'He only asked to have his bonds taken from him,' he said", " 'He would give his word not to attempt to escape, and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her", "' 'Then you can have a little rest,' he went on, 'for rice pounding is very tiring work, and not at all fit for weak women", "' These last words melted the good woman completely, and she unfastened the bonds that held him", ' Poor foolish creature! In one moment the Tanuki had seized her, stripped off all her clothes, and popped her in the mortar  In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice; and not content with that, the Tanuki placed a pot on the hearth and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife! When everything was complete he looked out of the door, and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood', " Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman's clothes, but, as he was a magician, assumed her form as well", ' Then he took the wood, kindled the fire, and very soon set a large dinner before the old man, who was very hungry, and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy  But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner, he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape', " Then he said to the peasant, 'You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them! You are caught in your own net", ' It is your own wife that you have eaten, and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor', "' With these words he turned and made for the forest", ' The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened, and seemed frozen to the place where he stood  When he had recovered himself a little, he collected the bones of his dead wife, buried them in the garden, and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki  After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly, and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife  There were formerly a King and a Queen, who were so sorry that they had no children, so sorry that it cannot be expressed  They went to all the waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried and all to no purpose  At last, however, the Queen proved with child, and was brought to bed of a daughter  There was a very fine christening; and the Princess had for her godmothers all the Fairies they could find in the whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one of them might give her a gift, as was the custom of Fairies in those days, and that by this means the Princess might have all the perfections imaginable', " After the ceremonies of the christening were over, all the company returned to the King's palace, where was prepared a great feast for the Fairies", ' There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife and fork, all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies  But as they were all sitting down at table, they saw come into the hall a very old Fairy whom they had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or inchanted  The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others, because they had seven only made for the seven Fairies  The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some threat between her teeth  One of the young Fairies, who sat by her, overheard how she grumbled; and judging that she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from the table, and hid herself behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair, as much as possible she could, the evil which the old Fairy might intend  In the mean while all the Fairies began to give their gifts to the Princess  The youngest gave her for gift, that she should be the most beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit of an angel; the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in every thing she did; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well; the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that she should play upon all kinds of music to the utmost perfection', " The old Fairy's turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite than age, she said, that the Princess should have her hand pierced with a spindle, and die of the wound", ' This terrible gift made the whole company tremble, and every body fell a-crying  At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings, and spake these words aloud: "Be reassured, O King and Queen; your daughter shall not die of this disaster: it is true, I have no power to undo intirely what my elder has done', " The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which shall last a hundred years; at the expiration of which a king's son shall come and awake her", '" The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused immediately proclamations to be made, whereby every-body was forbidden, on pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle or to have so much as any spindle in their houses  About fifteen or sixteen years after, the King and Queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure, the young Princess happened one day to divert herself running up and down the palace; when going up from one apartment to another, she came into a little room on the top of a tower, where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with her spindle', " This good woman had never heard of the King's proclamation against spindles", ' "What are you doing there, Goody?" said the Princess  "I am spinning, my pretty child," said the old woman, who did not know who she was  "Ha!" said the Princess, "this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give it to me, that I may see if I can do so " She had no sooner taken the spindle into her hand, than, whether being very hasty at it, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree of the Fairy had so ordained it, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon  The good old woman not knowing very well what to do in this affair, cried out for help', " People came in from every quarter in great numbers; they threw water upon the Princess's face, unlaced her, struck her on the palms of her hands, and rubbed her temples with Hungary-water; but nothing would bring her to herself", ' And now the King, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of the prediction of the Fairies, and judging very well that this must necessarily come to pass, since the Fairies had said it, caused the Princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver  One would have taken her for an angel, she was so very beautiful; for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion; her cheeks were carnation, and her lips like coral; indeed her eyes were shut, but she was heard to breathe softly, which satisfied those about her that she was not dead  The King commanded that they should not disturb her, but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awakening was come  The good Fairy, who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a hundred years, was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues off, when this accident befell the Princess; but she was instantly informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground at one stride  The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour after, in a fiery chariot, drawn by dragons  Round about the garden ran a hedge of hazel-bushes; beyond the hedge were fields and meadows with cows and sheep; but in the middle of the garden stood a Rose-tree in bloom, under which sat a Snail, whose shell contained a great deal--that is, himself  "Only wait till my time comes," he said; "I shall do more than grow roses, bear nuts, or give milk, like the hazel-bush, the cows and the sheep " "I expect a great deal from you," said the rose-tree  "May I ask when it will appear?" "I take my time," said the snail  "You\'re always in such a hurry  That does not excite expectation " The following year the snail lay in almost the same spot, in the sunshine under the rose-tree, which was again budding and bearing roses as fresh and beautiful as ever  The snail crept half out of his shell, stretched out his horns, and drew them in again  "Everything is just as it was last year! No progress at all; the rose-tree sticks to its roses and gets no farther " The summer and the autumn passed; the rose-tree bore roses and buds till the snow fell and the weather became raw and wet; then it bent down its head, and the snail crept into the ground  A new year began; the roses made their appearance, and the snail made his too  "You are an old rose-tree now," said the snail  "You must make haste and die  You have given the world all that you had in you; whether it was of much importance is a question that I have not had time to think about  But this much is clear and plain, that you have not done the least for your inner development, or you would have produced something else  Have you anything to say in defence? You will now soon be nothing but a stick  Do you understand what I say?" "You frighten me," said the rose--tree  "I have never thought of that " "No, you have never taken the trouble to think at all  Have you ever given yourself an account why you bloomed, and how your blooming comes about--why just in that way and in no other?" "No," said the rose-tree  "I bloom in gladness, because I cannot do otherwise  The sun shone and warmed me, and the air refreshed me; I drank the clear dew and the invigorating rain  I breathed and I lived! Out of the earth there arose a power within me, whilst from above I also received strength; I felt an ever-renewed and ever-increasing happiness, and therefore I was obliged to go on blooming  That was my life; I could not do otherwise " "You have led a very easy life," remarked the snail  "Certainly  Everything was given me," said the rose-tree  "But still more was given to you  Yours is one of those deep-thinking natures, one of those highly gifted minds that astonishes the world " "I have not the slightest intention of doing so," said the snail  There was once upon a time a man and his wife, and they had no children, which was a great grief to them', " One winter's day, when the sun was shining brightly, the couple were standing outside their cottage, and the woman was looking at all the little icicles which hung from the roof", " She sighed, and turning to her husband said, 'I wish I had as many children as there are icicles hanging there", "' 'Nothing would please me more either,' replied her husband", " Then a tiny icicle detached itself from the roof, and dropped into the woman's mouth, who swallowed it with a smile, and said, 'Perhaps I shall give birth to a snow child now!' Her husband laughed at his wife's strange idea, and they went back into the house", ' But after a short time the woman gave birth to a little girl, who was as white as snow and as cold as ice  If they brought the child anywhere near the fire, it screamed loudly till they put it back into some cool place  The little maid throve wonderfully, and in a few months she could run about and speak  But she was not altogether easy to bring up, and gave her parents much trouble and anxiety, for all summer she insisted on spending in the cellar, and in the winter she would sleep outside in the snow, and the colder it was the happier she seemed to be', " Her father and mother called her simply 'Our Snow-daughter,' and this name stuck to her all her life", ' One day her parents sat by the fire, talking over the extraordinary behaviour of their daughter, who was disporting herself in the snowstorm that raged outside', " The woman sighed deeply and said, 'I wish I had given birth to a Fire-son!' As she said these words, a spark from the big wood fire flew into the woman's lap, and she said with a laugh, 'Now perhaps I shall give birth to a Fire-son!' The man laughed at his wife's words, and thought it was a good joke", ' But he ceased to think it a joke when his wife shortly afterwards gave birth to a boy, who screamed lustily till he was put quite close to the fire, and who nearly yelled himself into a fit if the Snow-daughter came anywhere near him  The Snow-daughter herself avoided him as much as she could, and always crept into a corner as far away from him as possible', " The parents called the boy simply 'Our Fire-son,' a name which stuck to him all his life", ' They had a great deal of trouble and worry with him too; but he throve and grew very quickly, and before he was a year old he could run about and talk  He was as red as fire, and as hot to touch, and he always sat on the hearth quite close to the fire, and complained of the cold; if his sister were in the room he almost crept into the flames, while the girl on her part always complained of the great heat if her brother were anywhere near  In summer the boy always lay out in the sun, while the girl hid herself in the cellar: so it happened that the brother and sister came very little into contact with each other--in fact, they carefully avoided it  Just as the girl grew up into a beautiful woman, her father and mother both died one after the other', " Then the Fire-son, who had grown up in the meantime into a fine, strong young man, said to his sister, 'I am going out into the world, for what is the use of remaining on here?' 'I shall go with you,' she answered, 'for, except you, I have no one in the world, and I have a feeling that if we set out together we shall be lucky", "' The Fire-son said, 'I love you with all my heart, but at the same time I always freeze if you are near me, and you nearly die of heat if I approach you! How shall we travel about together without being odious the one to the other?' 'Don't worry about that,' replied the girl, 'for I've thought it all over, and have settled on a plan which will make us each able to bear with the other! See, I have had a fur cloak made for each of us, and if we put them on I shall not feel the heat so much nor you the cold", "' So they put on the fur cloaks, and set out cheerfully on their way, and for the first time in their lives quite happy in each other's company", ' For a long time the Fire-son and the Snow-daughter wandered through the world, and when at the beginning of winter they came to a big wood they determined to stay there till spring  The Fire-son built himself a hut where he always kept up a huge fire, while his sister with very few clothes on stayed outside night and day  Now it happened one day that the King of the land held a hunt in this wood, and saw the Snow-daughter wandering about in the open air  He wondered very much who the beautiful girl clad in such garments could be, and he stopped and spoke to her  He soon learnt that she could not stand heat, and that her brother could not endure cold  The King was so charmed by the Snow-daughter, that he asked her to be his wife  The girl consented, and the wedding was held with much state  The King had a huge house of ice made for his wife underground, so that even in summer it did not melt' ,  " 'How astonishingly cold it is! My body is cracking all over!' said the Snow-man", " 'The wind is really cutting one's very life out! And how that fiery thing up there glares!' He meant the sun, which was just setting", " 'It sha'n't make me blink, though, and I shall keep quite cool and collected", "' Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head; his mouth consisted of an old rake, so that he had teeth as well", ' He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys, and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges  The sun went down, the full moon rose, large, round, clear and beautiful, in the dark blue sky', " 'There it is again on the other side!' said the Snow-man, by which he meant the sun was appearing again", " 'I have become quite accustomed to its glaring", ' I hope it will hang there and shine, so that I may be able to see myself', " I wish I knew, though, how one ought to see about changing one's position", ' I should very much like to move about', " If I only could, I would glide up and down the ice there, as I saw the boys doing; but somehow or other, I don't know how to run", "' 'Bow-wow!' barked the old yard-dog; he was rather hoarse and couldn't bark very well", ' His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove', " 'The sun will soon teach you to run! I saw that last winter with your predecessor, and farther back still with his predecessors! They have all run away!' 'I don't understand you, my friend,' said the Snow-man", " 'That thing up there is to teach me to run?' He meant the moon", " 'Well, it certainly did run just now, for I saw it quite plainly over there, and now here it is on this side", "' 'You know nothing at all about it,' said the yard-dog", " 'Why, you have only just been made", ' The thing you see there is the moon; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun  He will come up again tomorrow morning, and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter  The weather is going to change; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg; the weather is certainly going to change', "' 'I can't understand him,' said the Snow-man; 'but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant", ' That thing that glares so, and then disappears, the sun, as he calls it, is not my friend  I know that by instinct', "' 'Bow-wow!' barked the yard-dog, and walked three times round himself, and then crept into his kennel to sleep", ' The weather really did change  Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood; later on came an icy wind, which sent the frost packing  But when the sun rose, it was a glorious sight  The trees and shrubs were covered with rime, and looked like a wood of coral, and every branch was thick with long white blossoms  There was once a dreadfully wicked hobgoblin  One day he was in capital spirits because he had made a looking-glass which reflected everything that was good and beautiful in such a way that it dwindled almost to nothing, but anything that was bad and ugly stood out very clearly and looked much worse  The most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled spinach, and the best people looked repulsive or seemed to stand on their heads with no bodies; their faces were so changed that they could not be recognised, and if anyone had a freckle you might be sure it would be spread over the nose and mouth  That was the best part of it, said the hobgoblin  But one day the looking-glass was dropped, and it broke into a million-billion and more pieces  And now came the greatest misfortune of all, for each of the pieces was hardly as large as a grain of sand and they flew about all over the world, and if anyone had a bit in his eye there it stayed, and then he would see everything awry, or else could only see the bad sides of a case  For every tiny splinter of the glass possessed the same power that the whole glass had  Some people got a splinter in their hearts, and that was dreadful, for then it began to turn into a lump of ice  The hobgoblin laughed till his sides ached, but still the tiny bits of glass flew about  And now we will hear all about it  In a large town, where there were so many people and houses that there was not room enough for everybody to have gardens, lived two poor children  They were not brother and sister, but they loved each other just as much as if they were  Their parents lived opposite one another in two attics, and out on the leads they had put two boxes filled with flowers  There were sweet peas in it, and two rose trees, which grow beautifully, and in summer the two children were allowed to take their little chairs and sit out under the roses  Then they had splendid games  In the winter they could not do this, but then they put hot pennies against the frozen window-panes, and made round holes to look at each other through  His name was Kay, and hers was Gerda  Outside it was snowing fast', " 'Those are the white bees swarming,' said the old grandmother", " 'Have they also a queen bee?' asked the little boy, for he knew that the real bees have one", " 'To be sure,' said the grandmother", " 'She flies wherever they swarm the thickest", ' She is larger than any of them, and never stays upon the earth, but flies again up into the black clouds  Often at midnight she flies through the streets, and peeps in at all the windows, and then they freeze in such pretty patterns and look like flowers', "' 'Yes, we have seen that,' said both children; they knew that it was true", " 'Can the Snow-queen come in here?' asked the little girl", " 'Just let her!' cried the boy, 'I would put her on the stove, and melt her!' But the grandmother stroked his hair, and told some more stories", ' In the evening, when little Kay was going to bed, he jumped on the chair by the window, and looked through the little hole  A few snow-flakes were falling outside, and one of the, the largest, lay on the edge of one of the window-boxes  The snow-flake grew larger and larger till it took the form of a maiden, dressed in finest white gauze  It was winter-time; the air was cold, the wind was sharp, but within the closed doors it was warm and comfortable, and within the closed door lay the flower; it lay in the bulb under the snow-covered earth  One day rain fell  The drops penetrated through the snowy covering down into the earth, and touched the flower-bulb, and talked of the bright world above  Soon the Sunbeam pierced its way through the snow to the root, and within the root there was a stirring  "Come in," said the flower  "I cannot," said the Sunbeam  "I am not strong enough to unlock the door! When the summer comes I shall be strong!" "When will it be summer?" asked the Flower, and she repeated this question each time a new sunbeam made its way down to her  But the summer was yet far distant  The snow still lay upon the ground, and there was a coat of ice on the water every night  "What a long time it takes! what a long time it takes!" said the Flower  "I feel a stirring and striving within me; I must stretch myself, I must unlock the door, I must get out, and must nod a good morning to the summer, and what a happy time that will be!" And the Flower stirred and stretched itself within the thin rind which the water had softened from without, and the snow and the earth had warmed, and the Sunbeam had knocked at; and it shot forth under the snow with a greenish-white blossom on a green stalk, with narrow thick leaves, which seemed to want to protect it  The snow was cold, but was pierced by the Sunbeam, therefore it was easy to get through it, and now the Sunbeam came with greater strength than before  "Welcome, welcome!" sang and sounded every ray, and the Flower lifted itself up over the snow into the brighter world  The Sunbeams caressed and kissed it, so that it opened altogether, white as snow, and ornamented with green stripes  It bent its head in joy and humility  "Beautiful Flower!" said the Sunbeams, "how graceful and delicate you are! You are the first, you are the only one! You are our love! You are the bell that rings out for summer, beautiful summer, over country and town  All the snow will melt; the cold winds will be driven away; we shall rule; all will become green, and then you will have companions, syringas, laburnums, and roses; but you are the first, so graceful, so delicate!" That was a great pleasure  It seemed as if the air were singing and sounding, as if rays of light were piercing through the leaves and the stalks of the Flower  There it stood, so delicate and so easily broken, and yet so strong in its young beauty; it stood there in its white dress with the green stripes, and made a summer  But there was a long time yet to the summer-time  Clouds hid the sun, and bleak winds were blowing  "You have come too early," said Wind and Weather  "We have still the power, and you shall feel it, and give it up to us  You should have stayed quietly at home and not have run out to make a display of yourself  Your time is not come yet!" It was a cutting cold! The days which now come brought not a single sunbeam  It was weather that might break such a little Flower in two with cold  But the Flower had more strength than she herself knew of  She was strong in joy and in faith in the summer, which would be sure to come, which had been announced by her deep longing and confirmed by the warm sunlight; and so she remained standing in confidence in the snow in her white garment, bending her head even while the snow-flakes fell thick and heavy, and the icy winds swept over her  "You\'ll break!" they said, "and fade, and fade! What did you want out here? Why did you let yourself be tempted? The Sunbeam only made game of you  Now you have what you deserve, you summer gauk "It is so delightfully cold," said the Snow Man, "that it makes my whole body crackle  This is just the kind of wind to blow life into one  How that great red thing up there is staring at me!" He meant the sun, who was just setting  "It shall not make me wink  I shall manage to keep the pieces " He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes; his mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth  He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips  The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue  "There it comes again, from the other side," said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more  "Ah, I have cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself  If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,--I should so like to move', " If I could, I would slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do; but I don't understand how; I don't even know how to run", '" "Away, away," barked the old yard-dog  He was quite hoarse, and could not pronounce "Bow wow" properly  He had once been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse ever since  "The sun will make you run some day  I saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him  Away, away, they all have to go " "I don\'t understand you, comrade," said the Snow Man  "Is that thing up yonder to teach me to run? I saw it running itself a little while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other side  "You know nothing at all," replied the yard-dog; "but then, you\'ve only lately been patched up  What you see yonder is the moon, and the one before it was the sun  It will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well; for I think the weather is going to change  I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg; I am sure there is going to be a change " "I don\'t understand him," said the Snow Man to himself; "but I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable  The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too " "Away, away," barked the yard-dog, and then he turned round three times, and crept into his kennel to sleep  There was really a change in the weather', " Towards morning, a thick fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so that the cold seemed to freeze one's bones; but when the sun rose, the sight was splendid", ' Trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost, and looked like a forest of white coral; while on every twig glittered frozen dew-drops  Once upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most mischievous of all sprites  One day he was in a very good humor, for he had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and beautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but that which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified and increased in ugliness  In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into frights, or appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so distorted that they were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole, you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose and mouth  "That\'s glorious fun!" said the sprite', " If a good thought passed through a man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the sprite laughed heartily at his clever discovery", ' All the little sprites who went to his school--for he kept a sprite school--told each other that a miracle had happened; and that now only, as they thought, it would be possible to see how the world really looked  They ran about with the mirror; and at last there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted in the mirror  So then they thought they would fly up to the sky, and have a joke there  The higher they flew with the mirror, the more terribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast  Higher and higher still they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the mirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands and fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more pieces', " And now it worked much more evil than before; for some of these pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in the wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed; and then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye for that which was evil", ' This happened because the very smallest bit had the same power which the whole mirror had possessed  Some persons even got a splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart became like a lump of ice', " Some of the broken pieces were so large that they were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's friends", ' Other pieces were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair when people put on their glasses to see well and rightly  Then the wicked sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his fancy  The fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall hear what happened next      Once upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens, but no children  This was a great grief to him, especially when he remembered that on his death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom  Now it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the King, and said, "Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be accomplished, and one of your seven Queens shall bear a son " The King\'s delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he gave orders for appropriate festivities to be prepared against the coming event throughout the length and breadth of the land', " Meanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid palace, attended by hundreds of female slaves, and fed to their hearts' content on sweetmeats and confectionery", ' Now the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before he started, the seven Queens sent him a message saying, "May it please our dearest lord not to hunt towards the north to-day, for we have dreamt bad dreams, and fear lest evil should befall you " The King, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their wishes, and set out towards the south; but as luck would have it, although he hunted diligently, he found no game  Nor had he more success to the east or west, so that, being a keen sportsman, and determined not to go home empty-handed, he forgot all about his promise, and turned to the north  Here also he was at first unsuccessful, but just as he had made up his mind to give up for that day, a white hind with golden horns and silver hoofs flashed past him into a thicket  So quickly did it pass that he scarcely saw it; nevertheless a burning desire to capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast  He instantly ordered his attendants to form a ring round the thicket, and so encircle the hind; then, gradually narrowing the circle, he pressed forward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in the midst', " Nearer and nearer he advanced, till, just as he thought to lay hold of the beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound, leapt clean over the King's head, and fled towards the mountains", ' Forgetful of all else, the King, setting spurs to his horse, followed at full speed  On, on he galloped, leaving his retinue far behind, keeping the white hind in view, never drawing bridle, until, finding himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet, he reined in his steed  Before him stood a miserable hovel, into which, being tired after his long, unsuccessful chase, he entered to ask for a drink of water  An old woman, seated in the hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request by calling to her daughter, and immediately from an inner room came a maiden so lovely and charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired, that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a sight in the wretched hovel', " She held the vessel of water to the King's lips, and as he drank he looked into her eyes, and then it became clear to him that the girl was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet he had chased so far", ' Her beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging her to return with him as his bride; but she only laughed, saying seven Queens were quite enough even for a King to manage  However, when he would take no refusal, but implored her to have pity on him, promising her everything she could desire, she replied, "Give me the eyes of your seven Queens, and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you say " The King was so carried away by the glamour of the white hind\'s magical beauty, that he went home at once, had the eyes of his seven Queens taken out, and, after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome dungeon whence they could not escape, set off once more for the hovel in the ravine, bearing with him his horrible offering  But the white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes, and threading them as a necklace, flung it round her mother\'s neck, saying, "Wear that, little mother, as a keepsake, whilst I am away in the King\'s palace " Then she went back with the bewitched monarch, as his bride, and he gave her the seven Queens\' rich clothes and jewels to wear, the seven Queens\' palace to live in, and the seven Queens\' slaves to wait upon her; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire  Now, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had their eyes torn out, and were cast into prison, a baby was born to the youngest of the Queens  It was a handsome boy, but the other Queens were very jealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate  But though at first they disliked the handsome little boy, he soon proved so useful to them, that ere long they all looked on him as their son  Almost as soon as he could walk about he began scraping at the mud wall of their dungeon, and in an incredibly short space of time had made a hole big enough for him to crawl through  Through this he disappeared, returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats, which he divided equally amongst the seven blind Queens  As he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two or three times every day to play with the little nobles in the town  No one knew who the tiny boy was, but everybody liked him, and he was so full of funny tricks and antics, so merry and bright, that he was sure to be rewarded by some girdle-cakes, a handful of parched grain, or some sweetmeats  All these things he brought home to his seven mothers, as he loved to call the seven blind Queens, who by his help lived on in their dungeon when all the world thought they had starved to death ages before  A soothsayer when on his deathbed wrote out the horoscope of his second son, whose name was Gangazara, and bequeathed it to him as his only property, leaving the whole of his estate to his eldest son  The second son thought over the horoscope, and said to himself: "Alas! am I born to this only in the world? The sayings of my father never failed', " I have seen them prove true to the last word while he was living; and how has he fixed my horoscope! 'FROM MY BIRTH POVERTY!' Nor is that my only fate", " 'FOR TEN YEARS, IMPRISONMENT'--a fate harder than poverty; and what comes next? 'DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE'; which means that I must die away from home, far from friends and relatives on a sea-coast", " Now comes the most curious part of the horoscope, that I am to 'HAVE SOME HAPPINESS AFTERWARDS!' What this happiness is, is an enigma to me", '" Thus thought he, and after all the funeral obsequies of his father were over, took leave of his elder brother, and started for Benares  He went by the middle of the Deccan, avoiding both the coasts, and went on journeying and journeying for weeks and months, till at last he reached the Vindhya mountains  While passing that desert he had to journey for a couple of days through a sandy plain, with no signs of life or vegetation  The little store of provision with which he was provided for a couple of days, at last was exhausted  The chombu, which he carried always full, filling it with the sweet water from the flowing rivulet or plenteous tank, he had exhausted in the heat of the desert  There was not a morsel in his hand to eat; nor a drop of water to drink  Turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert, out of which he saw no means of escape  Still he thought within himself, "Surely my father\'s prophecy never proved untrue  I must survive this calamity to find my death on some sea-coast " So thought he, and this thought gave him strength of mind to walk fast and try to find a drop of water somewhere to slake his dry throat  At last he succeeded; heaven threw in his way a ruined well  He thought he could collect some water if he let down his chombu with the string that he always carried noosed to the neck of it  Accordingly he let it down; it went some way and stopped, and the following words came from the well: "Oh, relieve me! I am the king of tigers, dying here of hunger  For the last three days I have had nothing  Fortune has sent you here  If you assist me now you will find a sure help in me throughout your life  Do not think that I am a beast of prey  When you have become my deliverer I will never touch you  Pray, kindly lift me up " Gangazara thought: "Shall I take him out or not? If I take him out he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth  No; that he will not do', " For my father's prophecy never came untrue", ' I must die on a sea coast, and not by a tiger " Thus thinking, he asked the tiger-king to hold tight to the vessel, which he accordingly did, and he lifted him up slowly  The tiger reached the top of the well and felt himself on safe ground  A long long time ago, an old couple dwelt in the very heart of a high mountain  They lived together in peace and harmony, although they were very different in character, the man being good-natured and honest, and the wife being greedy and quarrelsome when anyone came her way that she could possibly quarrel with  One day the old man was sitting in front of his cottage, as he was very fond of doing, when he saw flying towards him a little sparrow, followed by a big black raven  The poor little thing was very much frightened and cried out as it flew, and the great bird came behind it terribly fast, flapping its wings and craning its beak, for it was hungry and wanted some dinner', " But as they drew near the old man, he jumped up, and beat back the raven, which mounted, with hoarse screams of disappointment, into the sky, and the little bird, freed from its enemy, nestled into the old man's hand, and he carried it into the house", ' He stroked its feathers, and told it not to be afraid, for it was quite safe; but as he still felt its heart beating, he put it into a cage, where it soon plucked up courage to twitter and hop about  The old man was fond of all creatures, and every morning he used to open the cage door, and the sparrow flew happily about until it caught sight of a cat or a rat or some other fierce beast, when it would instantly return to the cage, knowing that there no harm could come to it', " The woman, who was always on the look-out for something to grumble at, grew very jealous of her husband's affection for the bird, and would gladly have done it some harm had she dared", ' At last, one morning her opportunity came  Her husband had gone to the town some miles away down the mountain, and would not be back for several hours, but before he left he did not forget to open the door of the cage', " The sparrow hopped about as usual, twittering happily, and thinking no evil, and all the while the woman's brow became blacker and blacker, and at length her fury broke out", ' She threw her broom at the bird, who was perched on a bracket high up on the wall  The broom missed the bird, but knocked down and broke the vase on the bracket, which did not soothe the angry woman  Then she chased it from place to place, and at last had it safe between her fingers, almost as frightened as on the day that it had made its first entrance into the hut  By this time the woman was more furious than ever  If she had dared, she would have killed the sparrow then and there, but as it was she only ventured to slit its tongue  The bird struggled and piped, but there was no one to hear it, and then, crying out loud with the pain, it flew from the house and was lost in the depths of the forest  By-and-bye the old man came back, and at once began to ask for his pet  His wife, who was still in a very bad temper, told him the whole story, and scolded him roundly for being so silly as to make such a fuss over a bird  But the old man, who was much troubled, declared she was a bad, hard-hearted woman, to have behaved so to a poor harmless bird; then he left the house, and went into the forest to seek for his pet  He walked many hours, whistling and calling for it, but it never came, and he went sadly home, resolved to be out with the dawn and never to rest till he had brought the wanderer back  Day after day he searched and called; and evening after evening he returned in despair  At length he gave up hope, and made up his mind that he should see his little friend no more  One hot summer morning, the old man was walking slowly under the cool shadows of the big trees, and without thinking where he was going, he entered a bamboo thicket  As the bamboos became thinner, he found himself opposite to a beautiful garden, in the centre of which stood a tiny spick-and-span little house, and out of the house came a lovely maiden, who unlatched the gate and invited him in the most hospitable way to enter and rest', " 'Oh, my dear old friend,' she exclaimed, 'how glad I am you have found me at last! I am your little sparrow, whose life you saved, and whom you took such care of", "' The old man seized her hands eagerly, but no time was given him to ask any questions, for the maiden drew him into the house, and set food before him, and waited on him herself", ' While he was eating, the damsel and her maids took their lutes, and sang and danced to him, and altogether the hours passed so swiftly that the old man never saw that darkness had come, or remembered the scolding he would get from his wife for returning home so late  Thus, in dancing and singing, and talking over the days when the maiden was a sparrow hopping in and out of her cage, the night passed away, and when the first rays of sun broke through the hedge of bamboo, the old man started up, thanked his hostess for her friendly welcome, and prepared to say farewell', " 'I am not going to let you depart like that,' said she; 'I have a present for you, which you must take as a sign of my gratitude" ,  'A sprightly tailor was employed by the great Macdonald, in his castle at Saddell, in order to make the laird a pair of trews, used in olden time  And trews being the vest and breeches united in one piece, and ornamented with fringes, were very comfortable, and suitable to be worn in walking or dancing  And Macdonald had said to the tailor, that if he would make the trews by night in the church, he would get a handsome reward  For it was thought that the old ruined church was haunted, and that fearsome things were to be seen there at night  The tailor was well aware of this; but he was a sprightly man, and when the laird dared him to make the trews by night in the church, the tailor was not to be daunted, but took it in hand to gain the prize  So, when night came, away he went up the glen, about half a mile distance from the castle, till he came to the old church  Then he chose him a nice gravestone for a seat and he lighted his candle, and put on his thimble, and set to work at the trews; plying his needle nimbly, and thinking about the hire that the laird would have to give him  For some time he got on pretty well, until he felt the floor all of a tremble under his feet; and looking about him, but keeping his fingers at work, he saw the appearance of a great human head rising up through the stone pavement of the church  And when the head had risen above the surface, there came from it a great, great voice  And the voice said: "Do you see this great head of mine?" "I see that, but I\'ll sew this!" replied the sprightly tailor; and he stitched away at the trews  Then the head rose higher up through the pavement, until its neck appeared  And when its neck was shown, the thundering voice came again and said: "Do you see this great neck of mine?" "I see that, but I\'ll sew this!" said the sprightly tailor; and he stitched away at his trews  Then the head and neck rose higher still, until the great shoulders and chest were shown above the ground  And again the mighty voice thundered: "Do you see this great chest of mine?" And again the sprightly tailor replied: "I see that, but I\'ll sew this!" and stitched away at his trews  And still it kept rising through the pavement, until it shook a great pair of arms in the tailor\'s face, and said: "Do you see these great arms of mine?" "I see those, but I\'ll sew this!" answered the tailor; and he stitched hard at his trews, for he knew that he had no time to lose  The sprightly tailor was taking the long stitches, when he saw it gradually rising and rising through the floor, until it lifted out a great leg, and stamping with it upon the pavement, said in a roaring voice: "Do you see this great leg of mine?" "Aye, aye: I see that, but I\'ll sew this!" cried the tailor; and his fingers flew with the needle, and he took such long stitches, that he was just come to the end of the trews, when it was taking up its other leg  But before it could pull it out of the pavement, the sprightly tailor had finished his task; and, blowing out his candle, and springing from off his gravestone, he buckled up, and ran out of the church with the trews under his arm  Then the fearsome thing gave a loud roar, and stamped with both his feet upon the pavement, and out of the church he went after the sprightly tailor', " Down the glen they ran, faster than the stream when the flood rides it; but the tailor had got the start and a nimble pair of legs, and he did not choose to lose the laird's reward", ' And though the thing roared to him to stop, yet the sprightly tailor was not the man to be beholden to a monster  So he held his trews tight, and let no darkness grow under his feet, until he had reached Saddell Castle  He had no sooner got inside the gate, and shut it, than the apparition came up to it; and, enraged at losing his prize, struck the wall above the gate, and left there the mark of his five great fingers', " Ye may see them plainly to this day, if ye'll only peer close enough", ' But the sprightly tailor gained his reward: for Macdonald paid him handsomely for the trews, and never discovered that a few of the stitches were somewhat long      Once upon a time there lived a man with one daughter and he made her work hard all the day  One morning when she had finished everything he had set her to do, he told her to go out into the woods and get some dry leaves and sticks to kindle a fire  The girl went out, and soon collected a large bundle, and then she plucked at a sprig of sweet-smelling rosemary for herself  But the harder she pulled the firmer seemed the plant, and at last, determined not to be beaten, she gave one great tug, and the rosemary remained in her hands', " Then she heard a voice close to her saying, 'Well?' and turning she saw before her a handsome young man, who asked why she had come to steal his firewood", ' The girl, who felt much confused, only managed to stammer out as an excuse that her father had sent her', " 'Very well,' replied the young man; 'then come with me", "' So he took her through the opening made by the torn-up root, and they travelled till they reached a beautiful palace, splendidly furnished, but only lighted from the top", ' And when they had entered he told her that he was a great lord, and that never had he seen a maiden so beautiful as she, and that if she would give him her heart they would be married and live happy for ever after', " And the maiden said 'yes, she would,' and so they were married", ' The next day the old dame who looked after the house handed her all the keys, but pointed her out one that she would do well never to use, for if she did the whole palace would fall to the ground, and the grass would grow over it, and the damsel herself would be remembered no more  The bride promised to be careful, but in a little while, when there was nothing left for her to do, she began to wonder what could be in the chest, which was opened by the key', " As everybody knows, if we once begin to think we soon begin to do, and it was not very long before the key was no longer in the maiden's hand but in the lock of the chest", ' But the lock was stiff and resisted all her efforts, and in the end she had to break it', " And what was inside after all? Why, nothing but a serpent's skin, which her husband, who was, unknown to her, a magician, put on when he was at work; and at the sight of it the girl was turning away in disgust, when the earth shook violently under her feet, the palace vanished as if it had never been, and the bride found herself in the middle of a field, not knowing where she was or whither to go", ' She burst into a flood of bitter tears, partly at her own folly, but more for the loss of her husband, whom she dearly loved  Then, breaking a sprig of rosemary off a bush hard by, she resolved, cost what it might, to seek him through the world till she found him  So she walked and she walked and she walked, till she arrived at a house built of straw  And she knocked at the door, and asked if they wanted a servant  The mistress said she did, and if the girl was willing she might stay  But day by day the poor maiden grew more and more sad, till at last her mistress begged her to say what was the matter  Then she told her story--how she was going through the world seeking after her husband', " And her mistress answered her, 'Where he is, none can tell better than the Sun, the Moon, and the Wind, for they go everywhere!' On hearing these words the damsel set forth once more, and walked till she reached the Golden Castle, where lived the Sun", " And she knocked boldly at the door, saying, 'All hail, O Sun! I have come to ask if, of your charity, you will help me in my need", ' By my own fault have I fallen into these straits, and I am weary, for I seek my husband through the wide world', "' 'Indeed!' spoke the Sun", " 'Do you, rich as you are, need help? But though you live in a palace without windows, the Sun enters everywhere, and he knows you", "' Then the bride told him the whole story", ' and did not hide her own ill-doing  And the Sun listened, and was sorry for her; and though he could not tell her where to go, he gave her a nut, and bid her open it in a time of great distress  When Abraham was born, his father, Terah, who was one of the chief officers of King Nimrod, gave a banquet to a large number of his friends', " He entertained them most sumptuously, and the merriest of the guests was the chief of the king's magicians", ' He was an old man, exceedingly fond of wine, and he drank deeply', " The feast lasted throughout the night, and the gray dawn of early morning appeared in the sky before Terah's friends thought of rising from the table", ' Suddenly the old magician jumped to his feet  "See," he cried, excitedly, pointing through the open door to the sky  "See yon bright star in the east  It flashes across the heavens " The others looked, but said they could see nothing  "Fools," shouted the old man, "ye may not see, but I do', " I, the wisest of the king's magicians and astrologers, tell you it is an omen", ' See how the brilliant star darts across the sky! It has swallowed a smaller star, and another, even a third, yet a fourth  It is an omen, I say, a portent that bodes ill  And, moreover," he added, growing still more excited, "it is an omen connected with the birth of the little son of Terah " "Nonsense," cried Terah  "Talk not to me of nonsense," said the magician, sternly  "I must hasten to inform the king " Hurriedly he left the house of Terah, followed by the other magicians, some of whom now said they also had seen a star swallow four others  They did not think it wise to contradict their chief, although he had drunk a great deal of wine and could not walk steadily  King Nimrod was awakened from his sleep, and his magicians appeared before him  "O King, live for ever," said the chief, by way of salute  "Grave indeed is the news that has led us to disturb thee in thy slumbers  This night a son has been born unto thy officer, Terah, and with the coming of the dawn a warning has appeared to us in the skies  I, the chief of thy magicians, did observe a brilliant star rise in the east and dart across the heavens and swallow four smaller stars " "We observed it, too," said the other magicians  "And what means this?" inquired the king  "It means," said the chief magician, mysteriously, "that this star-child will destroy other children, that his descendants will conquer thine  Take warning  Purchase this child from thy officer, Terah, and slay it so that it may not grow up a danger to thee " "Thy advice pleases me," said the cruel king  There were once upon a time five-and twenty tin-soldiers--all brothers, as they were made out of the same old tin spoon  Their uniform was red and blue, and they shouldered their guns and looked straight in front of them', " The first words that they heard in this world, when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off, were: 'Hurrah, tin-soldiers!' This was exclaimed by a little boy, clapping his hands; they had been given to him because it was his birthday, and now he began setting them out on the table", ' Each soldier was exactly like the other in shape, except just one, who had been made last when the tin had run short; but there he stood as firmly on his one leg as the others did on two, and he is the one that became famous  There were many other playthings on the table on which they were being set out, but the nicest of all was a pretty little castle made of cardboard, with windows through which you could see into the rooms  In front of the castle stood some little trees surrounding a tiny mirror which looked like a lake  Wax swans were floating about and reflecting themselves in it  That was all very pretty; but the most beautiful thing was a little lady, who stood in the open doorway  She was cut out of paper, but she had on a dress of the finest muslin, with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders, fastened in the middle with a glittering rose made of gold paper, which was as large as her head', " The little lady was stretching out both her arms, for she was a Dancer, and was lifting up one leg so high in the air that the Tin-soldier couldn't find it anywhere, and thought that she, too, had only one leg", " 'That's the wife for me!' he thought; 'but she is so grand, and lives in a castle, whilst I have only a box with four-and-twenty others", ' This is no place for her! But I must make her acquaintance', "' Then he stretched himself out behind a snuff-box that lay on the table; from thence he could watch the dainty little lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance", ' When the night came all the other tin-soldiers went into their box, and the people of the house went to bed  Then the toys began to play at visiting, dancing, and fighting  The tin-soldiers rattled in their box, for they wanted to be out too, but they could not raise the lid  The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the slate-pencil ran about the slate; there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk to them, in poetry too! The only two who did not stir from their places were the Tin-soldier and the little Dancer  She remained on tip-toe, with both arms outstretched; he stood steadfastly on his one leg, never moving his eyes from her face  The clock struck twelve, and crack! off flew the lid of the snuff-box; but there was no snuff inside, only a little black imp--that was the beauty of it', " 'Hullo, Tin-soldier!' said the imp", " 'Don't look at things that aren't intended for the likes of you!' But the Tin-soldier took no notice, and seemed not to hear", " 'Very well, wait till to-morrow!' said the imp", " When it was morning, and the children had got up, the Tin-soldier was put in the window; and whether it was the wind or the little black imp, I don't know, but all at once the window flew open and out fell the little Tin-soldier, head over heels, from the third-storey window! That was a terrible fall, I can tell you! He landed on his head with his leg in the air, his gun being wedged between two paving-stones", ' The nursery-maid and the little boy came down at once to look for him, but, though they were so near him that they almost trod on him, they did not notice him', " If the Tin-soldier had only called out 'Here I am!' they must have found him; but he did not think it fitting for him to cry out, because he had on his uniform", ' Soon it began to drizzle; then the drops came faster, and there was a regular down-pour  When it was over, two little street boys came along', " 'Just look!' cried one", " 'Here is a Tin-soldier! He shall sail up and down in a boat!' So they made a little boat out of newspaper, put the Tin-soldier in it, and made him sail up and down the gutter; both the boys ran along beside him, clapping their hands", ' What great waves there were in the gutter, and what a swift current! The paper-boat tossed up and down, and in the middle of the stream it went so quick that the Tin-soldier trembled; but he remained steadfast, showed no emotion, looked straight in front of him, shouldering his gun' ,  "  There dips the rocky highland  Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,  There lies a leafy island,  Where flapping herons wake  The drowsy water rats;  There we've hid our faery vats,  Full of berries,  And of reddest stolen cherries", "  Come away, O human child!  To the waters and the wild  With a faery, hand in hand,  For the world's more full of weeping than    you can understand", '  Where the wave of moonlight glosses  The dim gray sands with light,  Far off by furthest Rosses  We foot it all the night,  Weaving olden dances,  Mingling hands and mingling glances,  Till the moon has taken flight;  To and fro we leap  And chase the frothy bubbles,  While the world is full of troubles  And is anxious in its sleep', "  Come away, O human child!  To the waters and the wild  With a faery, hand in hand,  For the world's more full of weeping than    you can understand", '  Where the wandering water gushes  From the hills above Glen-Car,  In pools among the rushes  That scarce could bathe a star,  We seek for slumbering trout,  And whispering in their ears  Give them unquiet dreams;  Leaning softly out  From ferns that drop their tears  Over the young streams', "  Come away, O human child!  To the waters and the wild  With a faery, hand in hand,  For the world's more full of weeping than    you can understand", "  Away with us he's going,  The solemn-eyed:  He'll hear no more the lowing  Of the calves on the warm hillside;  Or the kettle on the hob  Sing peace into his breast,  Or see the brown mice bob  Round and round the oatmeal-chest", '  For he comes, the human child!  To the waters and the wild  With a faery, hand in hand,  From a world more full of weeping than    he can understand     This is the story which old Peter used to tell whenever either Vanya or Maroosia was cross  This did not often happen; but it would be no use to pretend that it never happened at all  Sometimes it was Vanya who scolded Maroosia, and sometimes it was Maroosia who scolded Vanya  Sometimes there were two scoldings going on at once  And old Peter did not like crossness in the hut, whoever did the scolding  He said it spoilt his tobacco and put a sour taste in the tea', " And, of course, when the children remembered that they were spoiling their grandfather's tea and tobacco they stopped just as quickly as they could, unless their tongues had run right away with them--which happens sometimes, you know, even to grown-up people", ' This story used to be told in two ways  It was either the tale of an old man who was bothered by a cross old woman, or the tale of an old woman who was bothered by a cross old man  And the moment old Peter began the story both children would ask at once, "Which is the cross one?"--for t hen they would know which of them old Peter thought was in the wrong  "This time it\'s the old woman," said their grandfather; "but, as like as not, it will be the old man next " And then any quarrelling there was came to an end, and was forgotten before the end of the story  This is the story  An old man and an old woman lived in a little wooden house  All round the house there was a garden, crammed with flowers, and potatoes, and beetroots, and cabbages  And in one corner of the house there was a narrow wooden stairway which went up and up, twisting and twisting, into a high tower  In the top of the tower was a dovecot, and on the top of the dovecot was a flat roof  Now, the old woman was never content with the doings of the old man  She scolded all day, and she scolded all night', " If there was too much rain, it was the old man's fault; and if there was a drought, and all green things were parched for lack of water, well, the old man was to blame for not altering the weather", ' And though he was old and tired, it was all the same to her how much work she put on his shoulders  The garden was full  There was no room in it at all, not even for a single pea  And all of a sudden the old woman sets her heart on growing turnips  "But there is no room in the garden," says the old man  "Sow them on the top of the dovecot," says the old woman  "But there is no earth there " "Carry earth up and put it there," says she  So the old man laboured up and down with his tired old bones, and covered the top of the dovecot with good black earth  He could only take up a very little at a time, because he was old and weak, and because the stairs were so narrow and dangerous that he had to hold on with both hands and carry the earth in a bag which he held in his teeth  Once upon a time there lived a stone-cutter, who went every day to a great rock in the side of a big mountain and cut out slabs for gravestones or for houses  He understood very well the kinds of stones wanted for the different purposes, and as he was a careful workman he had plenty of customers  For a long time he was quite happy and contented, and asked for nothing better than what he had  Now in the mountain dwelt a spirit which now and then appeared to men, and helped them in many ways to become rich and prosperous  The stone-cutter, however, had never seen this spirit, and only shook his head, with an unbelieving air, when anyone spoke of it  But a time was coming when he learned to change his opinion  One day the stone-cutter carried a gravestone to the house of a rich man, and saw there all sorts of beautiful things, of which he had never even dreamed', " Suddenly his daily work seemed to grow harder and heavier, and he said to himself: 'Oh, if only I were a rich man, and could sleep in a bed with silken curtains and golden tassels, how happy I should be!' And a voice answered him: 'Your wish is heard; a rich man you shall be!' At the sound of the voice the stone-cutter looked round, but could see nobody", ' He thought it was all his fancy, and picked up his tools and went home, for he did not feel inclined to do any more work that day  But when he reached the little house where he lived, he stood still with amazement, for instead of his wooden hut was a stately palace filled with splendid furniture, and most splendid of all was the bed, in every respect like the one he had envied  He was nearly beside himself with joy, and in his new life the old one was soon forgotten  It was now the beginning of summer, and each day the sun blazed more fiercely  One morning the heat was so great that the stone-cutter could scarcely breathe, and he determined he would stay at home till the evening  He was rather dull, for he had never learned how to amuse himself, and was peeping through the closed blinds to see what was going on in the street, when a little carriage passed by, drawn by servants dressed in blue and silver', " In the carriage sat a prince, and over his head a golden umbrella was held, to protect him from the sun's rays", " 'Oh, if I were only a prince!' said the stone-cutter to himself, as the carriage vanished round the corner", " 'Oh, if I were only a prince, and could go in such a carriage and have a golden umbrella held over me, how happy I should be!' And the voice of the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; a prince you shall be", "' And a prince he was", ' Before his carriage rode one company of men and another behind it; servants dressed in scarlet and gold bore him along, the coveted umbrella was held over his head, everything heart could desire was his  But yet it was not enough', " He looked round still for something to wish for, and when he saw that in spite of the water he poured on his grass the rays of the sun scorched it, and that in spite of the umbrella held over his head each day his face grew browner and browner, he cried in his anger: 'The sun is mightier than I; oh, if I were only the sun!' And the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; the sun you shall be", "' And the sun he was, and felt himself proud in his power", ' He shot his beams above and below, on earth and in heaven; he burnt up the grass in the fields and scorched the faces of princes as well as of poorer folk  But in a short time he began to grow tired of his might, for there seemed nothing left for him to do', " Discontent once more filled his soul, and when a cloud covered his face, and hid the earth from him, he cried in his anger: 'Does the cloud hold captive my rays, and is it mightier than I? Oh, that I were a cloud, and mightier than any!' And the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; a cloud you shall be!' And a cloud he was, and lay between the sun and the earth", " He caught the sun's beams and held them, and to his joy the earth grew green again and flowers blossomed", ' But that was not enough for him, and for days and weeks he poured forth rain till the rivers overflowed their banks, and the crops of rice stood in water  Towns and villages were destroyed by the power of the rain, only the great rock on the mountain side remained unmoved', " The cloud was amazed at the sight, and cried in wonder: 'Is the rock, then, mightier than I? Oh, if I were only the rock!' And the mountain spirit answered: 'Your wish is heard; the rock you shall be! And the rock he was, and gloried in his power", ' Proudly he stood, and neither the heat of the sun nor the force of the rain could move him' ,  " Perhaps some of you may have read a book called 'Kenneth; or the Rear-Guard of the Grand Army' of Napoleon", ' If so, you will remember how the two Scotch children found in Russia were taken care of by the French soldiers and prevented as far as possible from suffering from the horrors of the terrible Retreat  One of the soldiers, a Breton, often tried to make them forget how cold and hungry they were by telling them tales of his native country, Brittany, which is full of wonderful things  The best and warmest place round the camp fire was always given to the children, but even so the bitter frost would cause them to shiver', " It was then that the Breton would begin: 'Plouhinec is a small town near Hennebonne by the sea,' and would continue until Kenneth or Effie would interrupt him with an eager question", ' Then he forgot how his mother had told him the tale, and was obliged to begin all over again, so the story lasted a long while, and by the time it was ended the children were ready to be rolled up in what ever coverings could be found, and go to sleep  It is this story that I am going to tell to you  Plouhinec is a small town near Hennebonne by the sea  Around it stretches a desolate moor, where no corn can be grown, and the grass is so coarse that no beast grows fat on it  Here and there are scattered groves of fir trees, and small pebbles are so thick on the ground that you might almost take it for a beach  On the further side, the fairies, or korigans, as the people called them, had set up long long ago two rows of huge stones; indeed, so tall and heavy were they, that it seemed as if all the fairies in the world could not have placed them upright  Not far off them this great stone avenue, and on the banks of the little river Intel, there lived a man named Marzinne and his sister Rozennik  They always had enough black bread to eat, and wooden shoes or sabots to wear, and a pig to fatten, so the neighbours thought them quite rich; and what was still better, they thought themselves rich also  Rozennik was a pretty girl, who knew how to make the best of everything, and she could, if she wished, have chosen a husband from the young men of Plouhinec, but she cared for none of them except Bernez, whom she had played with all her life, and Bernez, though he worked hard, was so very very poor that Marzinne told him roughly he must look elsewhere for a wife  But whatever Marzinne might say Rozennik smiled and nodded to him as before, and would often turn her head as she passed, and sing snatches of old songs over her shoulder  Christmas Eve had come, and all the men who worked under Marzinne or on the farms round about were gathered in the large kitchen to eat the soup flavoured with honey followed by rich puddings, to which they were always invited on this particular night  In the middle of the table was a large wooden bowl, with wooden spoons placed in a circle round it, so that each might dip in his turn  The benches were filled, and Marzinne was about to give the signal, when the door was suddenly thrown open, and an old man came in, wishing the guests a good appetite for their supper  There was a pause, and some of the faces looked a little frightened; for the new-comer was well known to them as a beggar, who was also said to be a wizard who cast spells over the cattle, and caused the corn to grow black, and old people to die, of what, nobody knew  Still, it was Christmas Eve, and besides it was as well not to offend him, so the farmer invited him in, and gave him a seat at the table and a wooden spoon like the rest', " There was not much talk after the beggar's entrance, and everyone was glad when the meal came to an end, and the beggar asked if he might sleep in the stable, as he should die of cold if he were left outside", ' Rather unwillingly Marzinne gave him leave, and bade Bernez take the key and unlock the door  There was certainly plenty of room for a dozen beggars, for the only occupants of the stable were an old donkey and a thin ox; and as the night was bitter, the wizard lay down between them for warmth, with a sack of reeds for a pillow  He had walked far that day, and even wizards get tired sometimes, so in spite of the hard floor he was just dropping off to sleep, when midnight struck from the church tower of Plouhinec  At this sound the donkey raised her head and shook her ears, and turned towards the ox', " 'Well, my dear cousin,' said she, 'and how have you fared since last Christmas Eve, when we had a conversation together?' Instead of answering at once, the ox eyed the beggar with a long look of disgust", " 'What is the use of talking,' he replied roughly, 'when a good-for-nothing creature like that can hear all we say?' 'Oh, you mustn't lose time in grumbling,' rejoined the donkey gaily, 'and don't you see that the wizard is asleep?' 'His wicked pranks do not make him rich, certainly,' said the ox, 'and he isn't even clever enough to have found out what a piece of luck might befall him a week hence", "' 'What piece of luck?' asked the donkey", " 'Why, don't you know,' inquired the ox, 'that once very hundred years the stones on Plouhinec heath go down to drink at the river, and that while they are away the treasures underneath them are uncovered?' 'Ah, I remember now,' replied the donkey, 'but the stones return so quickly to their places, that you certainly would be crushed to death unless you have in your hands a bunch of crowsfoot and of five-leaved trefoil", "' 'Yes, but that is not enough,' said the ox; 'even supposing you get safely by, the treasure you have brought with you will crumble into dust if you do not give in exchange a baptised soul" ,  ' On the last house in a little village the storks had built a nest, and the mother stork sat in it with her four young ones, who stretched out their necks and pointed their black beaks, which had not yet turned red like those of the parent birds  A little way off, on the edge of the roof, stood the father stork, quite upright and stiff; not liking to be quite idle, he drew up one leg, and stood on the other, so still that it seemed almost as if he were carved in wood  "It must look very grand," thought he, "for my wife to have a sentry guarding her nest  They do not know that I am her husband; they will think I have been commanded to stand here, which is quite aristocratic;" and so he continued standing on one leg  In the street below were a number of children at play, and when they caught sight of the storks, one of the boldest amongst the boys began to sing a song about them, and very soon he was joined by the rest  These are the words of the song, but each only sang what he could remember of them in his own way   "Stork, stork, fly away,  Stand not on one leg, I pray,  See your wife is in her nest,  With her little ones at rest   They will hang one,  And fry another;  They will shoot a third,  And roast his brother " "Just hear what those boys are singing," said the young storks; "they say we shall be hanged and roasted " "Never mind what they say; you need not listen," said the mother  "They can do no harm " But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks, and mocking at them, excepting one of the boys whose name was Peter; he said it was a shame to make fun of animals, and would not join with them at all  The mother stork comforted her young ones, and told them not to mind  "See," she said, "How quiet your father stands, although he is only on one leg " "But we are very much frightened," said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests  The next day when the children were playing together, and saw the storks, they sang the song again--  "They will hang one,  And roast another " "Shall we be hanged and roasted?" asked the young storks  "No, certainly not," said the mother  "I will teach you to fly, and when you have learnt, we will fly into the meadows, and pay a visit to the frogs, who will bow themselves to us in the water, and cry \'Croak, croak,\' and then we shall eat them up; that will be fun " "And what next?" asked the young storks  "Then," replied the mother, "all the storks in the country will assemble together, and go through their autumn manoeuvres, so that it is very important for every one to know how to fly properly  If they do not, the general will thrust them through with his beak, and kill them  Therefore you must take pains and learn, so as to be ready when the drilling begins " "Then we may be killed after all, as the boys say; and hark! they are singing again " "Listen to me, and not to them," said the mother stork  "After the great review is over, we shall fly away to warm countries far from hence, where there are mountains and forests  To Egypt, where we shall see three-cornered houses built of stone, with pointed tops that reach nearly to the clouds  They are called Pyramids, and are older than a stork could imagine; and in that country, there is a river that overflows its banks, and then goes back, leaving nothing but mire; there we can walk about, and eat frogs in abundance " "Oh, o--h!" cried the young storks  "Yes, it is a delightful place; there is nothing to do all day long but eat, and while we are so well off out there, in this country there will not be a single green leaf on the trees, and the weather will be so cold that the clouds will freeze, and fall on the earth in little white rags' ,  " In the old days, when grandpapa was quite a little boy, and ran about in little red breeches and a red coat, and a feather in his cap--for that's the costume the little boys wore in his time when they were dressed in their best--many things were very different from what they are now", " There was often a good deal of show in the streets--show that we don't see nowadays, because it has been abolished as too old-fashioned", ' Still, it is very interesting to hear grandfather tell about it  It must really have been a gorgeous sight to behold, in those days, when the shoemaker brought over the shield, when the court-house was changed  The silken flag waved to and fro, on the shield itself a double eagle was displayed, and a big boot; the youngest lads carried the "welcome," and the chest of the workmen\'s guild, and their shirt-sleeves were adorned with red and white ribbons; the elder ones carried drawn swords, each with a lemon stuck on its point  There was a full band of music, and the most splendid of all the instruments was the "bird," as grandfather called the big stick with the crescent on the top, and all manner of dingle-dangles hanging to it--a perfect Turkish clatter of music', " The stick was lifted high in the air, and swung up and down till it jingled again, and quite dazzled one's eyes when the sun shone on all its glory of gold, and silver, and brass", ' In front of the procession ran the Harlequin, dressed in clothes made of all kinds of colored patches artfully sewn together, with a black face, and bells on his head like a sledge horse  He beat the people with his bat, which made a great clattering without hurting them, and the people would crowd together and fall back, only to advance again the next moment  Little boys and girls fell over their own toes into the gutter, old women dispensed digs with their elbows, and looked sour, and took snuff  One laughed, another chatted; the people thronged the windows and door-steps, and even all the roofs  The sun shone; and although they had a little rain too, that was good for the farmer; and when they got wetted thoroughly, they only thought what a blessing it was for the country  And what stories grandpapa could tell! As a little boy he had seen all these fine doings in their greatest pomp  The oldest of the policemen used to make a speech from the platform on which the shield was hung up, and the speech was in verse, as if it had been made by a poet, as, indeed it had; for three people had concocted it together, and they had first drunk a good bowl of punch, so that the speech might turn out well  And the people gave a cheer for the speech, but they shouted much louder for the Harlequin, when he appeared in front of the platform, and made a grimace at them  The fools played the fool most admirably, and drank mead out of spirit-glasses, which they then flung among the crowd, by whom they were caught up  Grandfather was the possessor of one of these glasses, which had been given him by a working mason, who had managed to catch it  Such a scene was really very pleasant; and the shield on the new court-house was hung with flowers and green wreaths  "One never forgets a feast like that, however old one may grow," said grandfather  Nor did he forget it, though he saw many other grand spectacles in his time, and could tell about them too; but it was most pleasant of all to hear him tell about the shield that was brought in the town from the old to the new court-house  Once, when he was a little boy, grandpapa had gone with his parents to see this festivity  He had never yet been in the metropolis of the country  There were so many people in the streets, that he thought that the shield was being carried  There were many shields to be seen; a hundred rooms might have been filled with pictures, if they had been hung up inside and outside', " At the tailor's were pictures of all kinds of clothing, to show that he could stitch up people from the coarsest to the finest; at the tobacco manufacturer's were pictures of the most charming little boys, smoking cigars, just as they do in reality; there were signs with painted butter, and herring, clerical collars, and coffins, and inscriptions and announcements into the bargain", ' A person could walk up and down for a whole day through the streets, and tire himself out with looking at the pictures; and then he would know all about what people lived in the houses, for they had hung out their shields or signs; and, as grandfather said, it was a very instructive thing, in a great town, to know at once who the inhabitants were  And this is what happened with these shields, when grandpapa came to the town  He told it me himself, and he hadn\'t "a rogue on his back," as mother used to tell me he had when he wanted to make me believe something outrageous, for now he looked quite trustworthy  The first night after he came to the town had been signalized by the most terrible gale ever recorded in the newspapers--a gale such as none of the inhabitants had ever before experienced  The air was dark with flying tiles; old wood-work crashed and fell; and a wheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone, only to get out of the way  At the time when the Tuatha De Dannan held the sovereignty of Ireland, there reigned in Leinster a king, who was remarkably fond of hearing stories  Like the other princes and chieftains of the island, he had a favourite story-teller, who held a large estate from his Majesty, on condition of telling him a new story every night of his life, before he went to sleep', " Many indeed were the stories he knew, so that he had already reached a good old age without failing even for a single night in his task; and such was the skill he displayed that whatever cares of state or other annoyances might prey upon the monarch's mind, his story-teller was sure to send him to sleep", ' One morning the story-teller arose early, and as his custom was, strolled out into his garden turning over in his mind incidents which he might weave into a story for the king at night  But this morning he found himself quite at fault; after pacing his whole demesne, he returned to his house without being able to think of anything new or strange  He found no difficulty in "there was once a king who had three sons" or "one day the king of all Ireland," but further than that he could not get  At length he went in to breakfast, and found his wife much perplexed at his delay  "Why don\'t you come to breakfast, my dear?" said she  "I have no mind to eat anything," replied the story-teller; "long as I have been in the service of the king of Leinster, I never sat down to breakfast without having a new story ready for the evening, but this morning my mind is quite shut up, and I don\'t know what to do  I might as well lie down and die at once', " I'll be disgraced for ever this evening, when the king calls for his story-teller", '" Just at this moment the lady looked out of the window  "Do you see that black thing at the end of the field?" said she  "I do," replied her husband  They drew nigh, and saw a miserable looking old man lying on the ground with a wooden leg placed beside him  "Who are you, my good man?" asked the story-teller  "Oh, then, \'tis little matter who I am', " I'm a poor, old, lame, decrepit, miserable creature, sitting down here to rest awhile", '" "An\' what are you doing with that box and dice I see in your hand?" "I am waiting here to see if any one will play a game with me," replied the beggar man  "Play with you! Why what has a poor old man like you to play for?" "I have one hundred pieces of gold in this leathern purse," replied the old man  "You may as well play with him," said the story-teller\'s wife; "and perhaps you\'ll have something to tell the king in the evening " A smooth stone was placed between them, and upon it they cast their throws  It was but a little while and the story-teller lost every penny of his money  "Much good may it do you, friend," said he  "What better hap could I look for, fool that I am!" "Will you play again?" asked the old man  "Don\'t be talking, man: you have all my money " "Haven\'t you chariot and horses and hounds?" "Well, what of them!" "I\'ll stake all the money I have against thine " "Nonsense, man! Do you think for all the money in Ireland, I\'d run the risk of seeing my lady tramp home on foot?" "Maybe you\'d win," said the bocough  "Maybe I wouldn\'t," said the story-teller  "Play with him, husband," said his wife  Once upon a time there lived a man who wasted all his money, and grew so poor that his only food was a few grains of corn, which he scratched like a fowl from out of a dust-heap  One day he was scratching as usual among a dust-heap in the street, hoping to find something for breakfast, when his eye fell upon a small silver coin, called an eighth, which he greedily snatched up', " 'Now I can have a proper meal,' he thought, and after drinking some water at a well he lay down and slept so long that it was sunrise before he woke again", ' Then he jumped up and returned to the dust-heap', " 'For who knows,' he said to himself, 'whether I may not have some good luck again", "' As he was walking down the road, he saw a man coming towards him, carrying a cage made of twigs", " 'Hi! you fellow!' called he, 'what have you got inside there?' 'Gazelles,' replied the man", " 'Bring them here, for I should like to see them", "' As he spoke, some men who were standing by began to laugh, saying to the man with the cage: 'You had better take care how you bargain with him, for he has nothing at all except what he picks up from a dust-heap, and if he can't feed himself, will he be able to feed a gazelle?' But the man with the cage made answer: 'Since I started from my home in the country, fifty people at the least have called me to show them my gazelles, and was there one among them who cared to buy? It is the custom for a trader in merchandise to be summoned hither and thither, and who knows where one may find a buyer?' And he took up his cage and went towards the scratcher of dust-heaps, and the men went with him", " 'What do you ask for your gazelles?' said the beggar", " 'Will you let me have one for an eighth?' And the man with the cage took out a gazelle, and held it out, saying, 'Take this one, master!' And the beggar took it and carried it to the dust-heap, where he scratched carefully till he found a few grains of corn, which he divided with his gazelle", ' This he did night and morning, till five days went by', " Then, as he slept, the gazelle woke him, saying, 'Master", "' And the man answered, 'How is it that I see a wonder?' 'What wonder?' asked the gazelle", " 'Why, that you, a gazelle, should be able to speak, for, from the beginning, my father and mother and all the people that are in the world have never told me of a talking gazelle", "' 'Never mind that,' said the gazelle, 'but listen to what I say! First, I took you for my master", ' Second, you gave for me all you had in the world  I cannot run away from you, but give me, I pray you, leave to go every morning and seek food for myself, and every evening I will come back to you  What you find in the dust-heaps is not enough for both of us', "' 'Go, then,' answered the master; and the gazelle went", ' When the sun had set, the gazelle came back, and the poor man was very glad, and they lay down and slept side by side', " In the morning it said to him, 'I am going away to feed", "' And the man replied, 'Go, my son,' but he felt very lonely without his gazelle, and set out sooner than usual for the dust-heap where he generally found most corn", ' And glad he was when the evening came, and he could return home  He lay on the grass chewing tobacco, when the gazelle trotted up', " 'Good evening, my master; how have you fared all day? I have been resting in the shade in a place where there is sweet grass when I am hungry, and fresh water when I am thirsty, and a soft breeze to fan me in the heat", ' It is far away in the forest, and no one knows of it but me, and to-morrow I shall go again', "' So for five days the gazelle set off at daybreak for this cool spot, but on the fifth day it came to a place where the grass was bitter, and it did not like it, and scratched, hoping to tear away the bad blades", ' But, instead, it saw something lying in the earth, which turned out to be a diamond, very large and bright', " 'Oh, ho!' said the gazelle to itself, 'perhaps now I can do something for my master who bought me with all the money he had; but I must be careful or they will say he has stolen it" ,  ' In the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived in Bagdad a merchant named Ali Cogia, who, having neither wife nor child, contented himself with the modest profits produced by his trade  He had spent some years quite happily in the house his father had left him, when three nights running he dreamed that an old man had appeared to him, and reproached him for having neglected the duty of a good Mussulman, in delaying so long his pilgrimage to Mecca  Ali Cogia was much troubled by this dream, as he was unwilling to give up his shop, and lose all his customers  He had shut his eyes for some time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage, and tried to atone to his conscience by an extra number of good works, but the dream seemed to him a direct warning, and he resolved to put the journey off no longer  The first thing he did was to sell his furniture and the wares he had in his shop, only reserving to himself such goods as he might trade with on the road  The shop itself he sold also, and easily found a tenant for his private house  The only matter he could not settle satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousand pieces of gold which he wished to leave behind him  After some thought, Ali Cogia hit upon a plan which seemed a safe one  He took a large vase, and placing the money in the bottom of it, filled up the rest with olives  After corking the vase tightly down, he carried it to one of his friends, a merchant like himself, and said to him: "My brother, you have probably heard that I am staffing with a caravan in a few days for Mecca  I have come to ask whether you would do me the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till I come back?" The merchant replied readily, "Look, this is the key of my shop: take it, and put the vase wherever you like  I promise that you shall find it in the same place on your return " A few days later, Ali Cogia mounted the camel that he had laden with merchandise, joined the caravan, and arrived in due time at Mecca  Like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred Mosque, and after all his religious duties were performed, he set out his goods to the best advantage, hoping to gain some customers among the passers-by  Very soon two merchants stopped before the pile, and when they had turned it over, one said to the other: "If this man was wise he would take these things to Cairo, where he would get a much better price than he is likely to do here " Ali Cogia heard the words, and lost no time in following the advice  He packed up his wares, and instead of returning to Bagdad, joined a caravan that was going to Cairo  The results of the journey gladdened his heart  He sold off everything almost directly, and bought a stock of Egyptian curiosities, which he intended selling at Damascus; but as the caravan with which he would have to travel would not be starting for another six weeks, he took advantage of the delay to visit the Pyramids, and some of the cities along the banks of the Nile  Now the attractions of Damascus so fascinated the worthy Ali, that he could hardly tear himself away, but at length he remembered that he had a home in Bagdad, meaning to return by way of Aleppo, and after he had crossed the Euphrates, to follow the course of the Tigris  But when he reached Mossoul, Ali had made such friends with some Persian merchants, that they persuaded him to accompany them to their native land, and even as far as India, and so it came to pass that seven years had slipped by since he had left Bagdad, and during all that time the friend with whom he had left the vase of olives had never once thought of him or of it', " In fact, it was only a month before Ali Cogia's actual return that the affair came into his head at all, owing to his wife's remarking one day, that it was a long time since she had eaten any olives, and would like some", ' "That reminds me," said the husband, "that before Ali Cogia went to Mecca seven years ago, he left a vase of olives in my care  But really by this time he must be dead, and there is no reason we should not eat the olives if we like  Give me a light, and I will fetch them and see how they taste " "My husband," answered the wife, "beware, I pray, of your doing anything so base! Supposing seven years have passed without news of Ali Cogia, he need not be dead for all that, and may come back any day  How shameful it would be to have to confess that you had betrayed your trust and broken the seal of the vase! Pay no attention to my idle words, I really have no desire for olives now  And probably after all this while they are no longer good  I have a presentiment that Ali Cogia will return, and what will he think of you? Give it up, I entreat " The merchant, however, refused to listen to her advice, sensible though it was  A mother sat there with her little child  She was so downcast, so afraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a deep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more sorrowfully on the little creature  Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed it, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face  As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove, that it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little hand  "Do you not think that I shall save him?" said she  "Our Lord will not take him from me!" And the old man--it was Death himself--he nodded so strangely, it could just as well signify yes as no  And the mother looked down in her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so heavy--she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights; and now she slept, but only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold  "What is that?" said she, and looked on all sides; but the old man was gone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him; and the old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still  But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child  Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black clothes; and she said, "Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him hasten away with thy little child; he goes faster than the wind, and he never brings back what he takes!" "Oh, only tell me which way he went!" said the mother  "Tell me the way, and I shall find him!" "I know it!" said the woman in the black clothes  "But before I tell it, thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child! I am fond of them  I have heard them before; I am Night; I saw thy tears whilst thou sang\'st them!" "I will sing them all, all!" said the mother  "But do not stop me now--I may overtake him--I may find my child!" But Night stood still and mute  Then the mother wrung her hands, sang and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then Night said, "Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw Death take his way with thy little child!" The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no longer knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush; there was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter season, and ice-flakes hung on the branches  "Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?" said the mother  "Yes," said the thorn-bush; "but I will not tell thee which way he took, unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart  I am freezing to death; I shall become a lump of ice!" And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might be thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and her blood flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart of the afflicted mother was so warm; and the thorn-bush told her the way she should go  She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat  The lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open, nor low enough that she could wade through it; and across it she must go if she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and that was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless  "Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!" said the weeping mother; and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of the waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her up, as if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore on the opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange house, one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were built up; but the poor mother could not see it; she had wept her eyes out  "Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?" said she  "He has not come here yet!" said the old grave woman, who was appointed to look after Death\'s great greenhouse! "How have you been able to find the way hither? And who has helped you?" "OUR LORD has helped me," said she  "He is merciful, and you will also be so! Where shall I find my little child?" "Nay, I know not," said the woman, "and you cannot see! Many flowers and trees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant them over again! You certainly know that every person has his or her life\'s tree or flower, just as everyone happens to be settled; they look like other plants, but they have pulsations of the heart  Children\'s hearts can also beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know your child\'s; but what will you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?" "I have nothing to give," said the afflicted mother, "but I will go to the world\'s end for you!" "Nay, I have nothing to do there!" said the woman  "But you can give me your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that I like! You shall have my white hair instead, and that\'s always something!" "Do you demand nothing else?" said she  "That I will gladly give you!" And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman\'s snow-white hair instead', " So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew strangely into one another", ' There stood fine hyacinths under glass bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants, some so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them, and black crabs pinched their stalks  There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had its name; each of them was a human life, the human frame still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about in the world  Once upon a time there lived in a little village in the very middle of France a widow and her only son, a boy about fifteen, whose name was Antoine, though no one ever called him anything but Toueno-Boueno  They were very poor indeed, and their hut shook about their ears on windy nights, till they expected the walls to fall in and crush them, but instead of going to work as a boy of his age ought to do, Toueno-Boueno did nothing but lounge along the street, his eyes fixed on the ground, seeing nothing that went on round him', " 'You are very, very stupid, my dear child,' his mother would sometimes say to him, and then she would add with a laugh, 'Certainly you will never catch a wolf by the tail", "' One day the old woman bade Antoine go into the forest and collect enough dry leaves to make beds for herself and him", ' Before he had finished it began to rain heavily, so he hid himself in the hollow trunk of a tree, where he was so dry and comfortable that he soon fell fast asleep  By and by he was awakened by a noise which sounded like a dog scratching at the door, and he suddenly felt frightened, why he did not know  Very cautiously he raised his head, and right above him he saw a big hairy animal, coming down tail foremost', " 'It is the wolf that they talk so much about,' he said to himself, and he made himself as small as he could and shrunk into a corner", ' The wolf came down the inside of the tree, slowly, slowly; Antoine felt turned to stone, so terrified was he, and hardly dared to breathe  Suddenly an idea entered his mind, which he thought might save him still', " He remembered to have heard from his mother that a wolf could neither bend his back nor turn his head, so as to look behind him, and quick as lightning he stretched up his hand, and seizing the wolf's tail, pulled it towards him", " Then he left the tree and dragged the animal to his mother's house", " 'Mother, you have often declared that I was too stupid to catch a wolf by the tail", " Now see,' he cried triumphantly", " 'Well, well, wonders will never cease,' answered the good woman, who took care to keep at a safe distance", " 'But as you really have got him, let us see if we can't put him to some use", ' Fetch the skin of the ram which died last week out of the chest, and we will sew the wolf up in it  He will make a splendid ram, and to-morrow we will drive him to the fair and sell him', "' Very likely the wolf, who was cunning and clever, may have understood what she said, but he thought it best to give no sign, and suffered the skin to be sewn upon him", " 'I can always get away if I choose,' thought he, 'it is better not to be in a hurry;' so he remained quite still while the skin was drawn over his head, which made him very hot and uncomfortable, and resisted the temptation to snap off the fingers or noses that were so close to his mouth", " The fair was at its height next day when Toueno-Boueno arrived with his wolf in ram's clothing", ' All the farmers crowded round him, each offering a higher price than the last  Never had they beheld such a beautiful beast, said they, and at last, after much bargaining, he was handed over to three brothers for a good sum of money  It happened that these three brothers owned large flocks of sheep, though none so large and fine as the one they had just bought', " 'My flock is the nearest,' observed the eldest brother; 'we will leave him in the fold for the night, and to-morrow we will decide which pastures will be best for him", "' And the wolf grinned as he listened, and held up his head a little higher than before", ' Early next morning the young farmer began to go his rounds, and the sheep-fold was the first place he visited  To his horror, the sheep were all stretched out dead before him, except one, which the wolf had eaten, bones and all  Instantly the truth flashed upon him  It was no ram that lay curled up in the corner pretending to be asleep (for in reality he could bend back and turn his head as much as he liked), but a wolf who was watching him out of the corner of his eye, and might spring upon him at any moment  In a certain village there lived two people who had both the same name  Both were called Klaus, but one owned four horses and the other only one  In order to distinguish the one from the other, the one who had four horses was called Big Klaus, and the one who had only one horse, Little Klaus  Now you shall hear what befell them both, for this is a true story  The whole week through Little Klaus had to plough for Big Klaus, and lend him his one horse; then Big Klaus lent him his four horses, but only once a week, and that was on Sunday  Hurrah! how loudly Little Klaus cracked his whip over all the five horses! for they were indeed as good as his on this one day  The sun shone brightly, and all the bells in the church-towers were pealing; the people were dressed in their best clothes, and were going to church, with their hymn books under their arms, to hear the minister preach', " They saw Little Klaus ploughing with the five horses; but he was so happy that he kept on cracking his whip, and calling out 'Gee-up, my five horses!' 'You mustn't say that,' said Big Klaus", " 'Only one horse is yours", "' But as soon as someone else was going by Little Klaus forgot that he must not say it, and called out 'Gee-up, my five horses!' 'Now you had better stop that,' said Big Klaus, 'for if you say it once more I will give your horse such a crack on the head that it will drop down dead on the spot!' 'I really won't say it again!' said Little Klaus", " But as soon as more people passed by, and nodded him good-morning, he became so happy in thinking how well it looked to have five horses ploughing his field that, cracking his whip, he called out 'Gee-up, my five horses!' 'I'll see to your horses!' said Big Klaus; and, seizing an iron bar, he struck Little Klaus' one horse such a blow on the head that it fell down and died on the spot", " 'Alas! Now I have no horse!' said Little Klaus, beginning to cry", ' Then he flayed the skin off his horse, dried it, and put it in a sack, which he threw over his shoulder, and went into the town to sell it  He had a long way to go, and had to pass through a great dark forest  A dreadful storm came on, in which he lost his way, and before he could get on to the right road night came on, and it was impossible to reach the town that evening  Right in front of him was a large farm-house  The window-shutters were closed, but the light came through the chinks', " 'I should very much like to be allowed to spend the night there,' thought Little Klaus; and he went and knocked at the door", " The farmer's wife opened it, but when she heard what he wanted she told him to go away; her husband was not at home, and she took in no strangers", " 'Well, I must lie down outside,' said Little Klaus; and the farmer's wife shut the door in his face", ' Close by stood a large haystack, and between it and the house a little out-house, covered with a flat thatched roof', " 'I can lie down there,' thought Little Klaus, looking at the roof; 'it will make a splendid bed, if only the stork won't fly down and bite my legs", "' For a live stork was standing on the roof, where it had its nest", ' So Little Klaus crept up into the out-house, where he lay down, and made himself comfortable for the night  The wooden shutters over the windows were not shut at the top, and he could just see into the room  There stood a large table, spread with wine and roast meat and a beautiful fish', " The farmer's wife and the sexton sat at the table, but there was no one else", ' She was filling up his glass, while he stuck his fork into the fish which was his favourite dish', " 'If one could only get some of that!' thought Little Klaus, stretching his head towards the window", ' Ah, what delicious cakes he saw standing there! It WAS a feast! Then he heard someone riding along the road towards the house  In the days of long ago, when Persia was a famous and beautiful land, with innumerable rose gardens that perfumed the whole country and gorgeous palaces, there lived a king, named Hormuz  He was a cruel monarch, this Shah of Persia  He tyrannized over his people and never allowed them to live in peace  Above all, he hated the Jews  "These descendants of Abraham," he said to his grand vizier, "never know when they are beaten  How many times it has been reported to me that they have been wiped out of existence, or driven from the land, I know not  Yet nothing, it seems, can crush their spirit  Tell me, why is this?" "It is because they have a firm faith in their future," answered the vizier  "What mean you by those words?" demanded the king, angrily  "I speak only of what I have heard from their wise men," the vizier replied, hastily  "They hold the belief that they will be restored as a united people to their own land " "Under their own king?" interrupted Hormuz  "Under a descendant of the royal House of David," the vizier answered, solemnly  The king stamped his foot with rage  "How dare they think of any other Shah but me," he exclaimed, for his one idea of ruling over people was that he had every right to be cruel to them  Then he said suddenly, "Think you that if there were no more people who could trace their ancestry to this--this David, their faith would be shattered?" "Peradventure, it may be so " "It shall be so," cried the king  "There shall be no remnants of this House of David " He summoned his executioners, and when they were lined up before him, he surveyed the evil-looking band with a cunning gleam in his eye  "Unto you," he said, in a rasping voice, "I hand over all the descendants of the House of David to be found among the Jews in the whole of the realm of Persia  Slay them instantly  See to it that not a single one--man, woman, or child--is left alive  Woe betide you, and you my counselors"--this with a meaning glance at the grand vizier--"if my commands are not carried out to the letter  To your duties  Ye are dismissed from the presence " Waving them away, he indulged his fancy in thoughts of the coming executions, chuckling the while  From day to day he received reports that his commands were being carried out  The land was filled with weeping, for the cruel butchery was worse than war  None could defend themselves  Mere suspicion was enough for the executioners  Once upon a time there lived a man who had three sons  The eldest was called Peppe, the second Alfin, and the youngest Ciccu  They were all very poor, and at last things got so bad that they really had not enough to eat', " So the father called his sons, and said to them, ' My dear boys, I am too old to work any more, and there is nothing left for me but to beg in the streets", "' 'No, no!' exclaimed his sons; 'that you shall never do", ' Rather, if it must be, would we do it ourselves  But we have thought of a better plan than that', "' 'What is it?' asked the father", " 'Well, we will take you in the forest, where you shall cut wood, and then we will bind it up in bundles and sell it in the town", "' So their father let them do as they said, and they all made their way into the forest; and as the old man was weak from lack of food his sons took it in turns to carry him on their backs", ' Then they built a little hut where they might take shelter, and set to work  Every morning early the father cut his sticks, and the sons bound them in bundles, and carried them to the town, bringing back the food the old man so much needed  Some months passed in this way, and then the father suddenly fell ill, and knew that the time had come when he must die  He bade his sons fetch a lawyer, so that he might make his will, and when the man arrived he explained his wishes', " 'I have,' said he, 'a little house in the village, and over it grows a fig-tree", ' The house I leave to my sons, who are to live in it together; the fig-tree I divide as follows  To my son Peppe I leave the branches  To my son Alfin I leave the trunk  To my son Ciccu I leave the fruit  Besides the house and tree, I have an old coverlet, which I leave to my eldest son  And an old purse, which I leave to my second son  And a horn, which I leave to my youngest son  And now farewell', "' Thus speaking, he laid himself down, and died quietly", ' The brothers wept bitterly for their father, whom they loved, and when they had buried him they began to talk over their future lives', " 'What shall we do now?' said they", " 'Shall we live in the wood, or go back to the village?' And they made up their minds to stay where they were and continue to earn their living by selling firewood", ' One very hot evening, after they had been working hard all day, they fell asleep under a tree in front of the hut  And as they slept there came by three fairies, who stopped to look at them', " 'What fine fellows!' said one" ,  'There was a man in Ireland once who was called Malcolm Harper', " The man was a right good man, and he had a goodly share of this world's goods", ' He had a wife, but no family  What did Malcolm hear but that a soothsayer had come home to the place, and as the man was a right good man, he wished that the soothsayer might come near them  Whether it was that he was invited or that he came of himself, the soothsayer came to the house of Malcolm  "Are you doing any soothsaying?" says Malcolm  "Yes, I am doing a little  Are you in need of soothsaying?" "Well, I do not mind taking soothsaying from you, if you had soothsaying for me, and you would be willing to do it " "Well, I will do soothsaying for you  What kind of soothsaying do you want?" "Well, the soothsaying I wanted was that you would tell me my lot or what will happen to me, if you can give me knowledge of it " "Well, I am going out, and when I return, I will tell you " And the soothsayer went forth out of the house and he was not long outside when he returned  "Well," said the soothsayer, "I saw in my second sight that it is on account of a daughter of yours that the greatest amount of blood shall be shed that has ever been shed in Erin since time and race began  And the three most famous heroes that ever were found will lose their heads on her account " After a time a daughter was born to Malcolm, he did not allow a living being to come to his house, only himself and the nurse  He asked this woman, "Will you yourself bring up the child to keep her in hiding far away where eye will not see a sight of her nor ear hear a word about her?" The woman said she would, so Malcolm got three men, and he took them away to a large mountain, distant and far from reach, without the knowledge or notice of any one  He caused there a hillock, round and green, to be dug out of the middle, and the hole thus made to be covered carefully over so that a little company could dwell there together  This was done  Deirdre and her foster-mother dwelt in the bothy mid the hills without the knowledge or the suspicion of any living person about them and without anything occurring, until Deirdre was sixteen years of age  Deirdre grew like the white sapling, straight and trim as the rash on the moss  She was the creature of fairest form, of loveliest aspect, and of gentlest nature that existed between earth and heaven in all Ireland--whatever colour of hue she had before, there was nobody that looked into her face but she would blush fiery red over it  The woman that had charge of her, gave Deirdre every information and skill of which she herself had knowledge and skill  There was not a blade of grass growing from root, nor a bird singing in the wood, nor a star shining from heaven but Deirdre had a name for it  But one thing, she did not wish her to have either part or parley with any single living man of the rest of the world  But on a gloomy winter night, with black, scowling clouds, a hunter of game was wearily travelling the hills, and what happened but that he missed the trail of the hunt, and lost his course and companions  A drowsiness came upon the man as he wearily wandered over the hills, and he lay down by the side of the beautiful green knoll in which Deirdre lived, and he slept  The man was faint from hunger and wandering, and benumbed with cold, and a deep sleep fell upon him  When he lay down beside the green hill where Deirdre was, a troubled dream came to the man, and he thought that he enjoyed the warmth of a fairy broch, the fairies being inside playing music', " The hunter shouted out in his dream, if there was any one in the broch, to let him in for the Holy One's sake", ' Deirdre heard the voice and said to her foster-mother: "O foster-mother, what cry is that?" "It is nothing at all, Deirdre--merely the birds of the air astray and seeking each other  In a certain town there lived a judge who was married but had no children  One day he was standing lost in thought before his house, when an old man passed by', " 'What is the matter, sir, said he, 'you look troubled?' 'Oh, leave me alone, my good man!' 'But what is it?' persisted the other", " 'Well, I am successful in my profession and a person of importance, but I care nothing for it all, as I have no children", "' Then the old man said, 'Here are twelve apples", ' If your wife eats them, she will have twelve sons', "' The judge thanked him joyfully as he took the apples, and went to seek his wife", " 'Eat these apples at once,' he cried, 'and you will have twelve sons", "' So she sat down and ate eleven of them, but just as she was in the middle of the twelfth her sister came in, and she gave her the half that was left", ' The eleven sons came into the world, strong and handsome boys; but when the twelfth was born, there was only half of him  By-and-by they all grew into men, and one day they told their father it was high time he found wives for them', " 'I have a brother,' he answered, 'who lives away in the East, and he has twelve daughters; go and marry them", "' So the twelve sons saddled their horses and rode for twelve days, till they met an old woman", " 'Good greeting to you, young men!' said she, 'we have waited long for you, your uncle and I", ' The girls have become women, and are sought, in marriage by many, but I knew you would come one day, and I have kept them for you  Follow me into my house', "' And the twelve brothers followed her gladly, and their father's brother stood at the door, and gave them meat and drink", " But at night, when every one was asleep, Halfman crept softly to his brothers, and said to them, 'Listen, all of you! This man is no uncle of ours, but an ogre", "' 'Nonsense; of course he is our uncle,' answered they", " 'Well, this very night you will see!' said Halfman", ' And he did not go to bed, but hid himself and watched  Now in a little while he saw the wife of the ogre steal into the room on tiptoe and spread a red cloth over the brothers and then go and cover her daughters with a white cloth  After that she lay down and was soon snoring loudly  When Halfman was quite sure she was sound asleep, he took the red cloth from his brothers and put it on the girls, and laid their white cloth over his brothers', " Next he drew their scarlet caps from their heads and exchanged them for the veils which the ogre's daughters were wearing", ' This was hardly done when he heard steps coming along the floor, so he hid himself quickly in the folds of a curtain  There was only half of him! The ogress came slowly and gently along, stretching out her hands before her, so that she might not fall against anything unawares, for she had only a tiny lantern slung at her waist, which did not give much light  And when she reached the place where the sisters were lying, she stooped down and held a corner of the cloth up to the lantern  Yes! it certainly was red! Still, to make sure that there was no mistake, she passed her hands lightly over their heads, and felt the caps that covered them  Then she was quite certain the brothers lay sleeping before her, and began to kill them one by one  Once upon a time there lived a poor woman who had only one child, and he was a little boy called Hassebu  When he ceased to be a baby, and his mother thought it was time for him to learn to read, she sent him to school', " And, after he had done with school, he was put into a shop to learn how to make clothes, and did not learn; and he was put to do silversmith's work, and did not learn; and whatsoever he was taught, he did not learn it", " His mother never wished him to do anything he did not like, so she said: 'Well, stay at home, my son", "' And he stayed at home, eating and sleeping", " One day the boy said to his mother: 'What was my father's business?' 'He was a very learned doctor,' answered she", " 'Where, then, are his books?' asked Hassebu", " 'Many days have passed, and I have thought nothing of them", ' But look inside and see if they are there', "' So Hassebu looked, and saw they were eaten by insects, all but one book, which he took away and read", " He was sitting at home one morning poring over the medicine book, when some neighbours came by and said to his mother: 'Give us this boy, that we may go together to cut wood", "' For wood-cutting was their trade, and they loaded several donkeys with the wood, and sold it in the town", " And his mother answered, 'Very well; to-morrow I will buy him a donkey, and you can all go together", "' So the donkey was bought, and the neighbours came, and they worked hard all day, and in the evening they brought the wood back into the town, and sold it for a good sum of money", ' And for six days they went and did the like, but on the seventh it rained, and the wood-cutters ran and hid in the rocks, all but Hassebu, who did not mind wetting, and stayed where he was  While he was sitting in the place where the wood-cutters had left him, he took up a stone that lay near him, and idly dropped it on the ground', " It rang with a hollow sound, and he called to his companions, and said, 'Come here and listen; the ground seems hollow!' 'Knock again!' cried they", ' And he knocked and listened', " 'Let us dig,' said the boy", ' And they dug, and found a large pit like a well, filled with honey up to the brim', " 'This is better than firewood,' said they; 'it will bring us more money", ' And as you have found it, Hassebu, it is you who must go inside and dip out the honey and give to us, and we will take it to the town and sell it, and will divide the money with you', "' The following day each man brought every bowl and vessel he could find at home, and Hassebu filled them all with honey", ' And this he did every day for three months  At the end of that time the honey was very nearly finished, and there was only a little left, quite at the bottom, and that was very deep down, so deep that it seemed as if it must be right in the middle of the earth', " Seeing this, the men said to Hassebu, 'We will put a rope under your arms, and let you down, so that you may scrape up all the honey that is left, and when you have done we will lower the rope again, and you shall make it fast, and we will draw you up", "' 'Very well,' answered the boy, and he went down, and he scraped and scraped till there was not so much honey left as would cover the point of a needle", ' \'Now I am ready!\' he cried; but they consulted together and said, \'Let us leave him there inside the pit, and take his share of the money, and we will tell his mother, "Your son was caught by a lion and carried off into the forest, and we tried to follow him, but could not "\' Then they arose and went into the town and told his mother as they had agreed, and she wept much and made her mourning for many months', " And when the men were dividing the money, one said, 'Let us send a little to our friend's mother,' and they sent some to her; and every day one took her rice, and one oil; one took her meat, and one took her cloth, every day" ,  ' There was once upon a time a peasant-woman who had a daughter and a step-daughter', " The daughter had her own way in everything, and whatever she did was right in her mother's eyes; but the poor step-daughter had a hard time", ' Let her do what she would, she was always blamed, and got small thanks for all the trouble she took; nothing was right, everything wrong; and yet, if the truth were known, the girl was worth her weight in gold--she was so unselfish and good-hearted', " But her step-mother did not like her, and the poor girl's days were spent in weeping; for it was impossible to live peacefully with the woman", " The wicked shrew was determined to get rid of the girl by fair means or foul, and kept saying to her father: 'Send her away, old man; send her away--anywhere so that my eyes sha'n't be plagued any longer by the sight of her, or my ears tormented by the sound of her voice", ' Send her out into the fields, and let the cutting frost do for her', "' In vain did the poor old father weep and implore her pity; she was firm, and he dared not gainsay her", ' So he placed his daughter in a sledge, not even daring to give her a horse-cloth to keep herself warm with, and drove her out on to the bare, open fields, where he kissed her and left her, driving home as fast as he could, that he might not witness her miserable death  Deserted by her father, the poor girl sat down under a fir-tree at the edge of the forest and began to weep silently  Suddenly she heard a faint sound: it was King Frost springing from tree to tree, and cracking his fingers as he went  At length he reached the fir-tree beneath which she was sitting, and with a crisp crackling sound he alighted beside her, and looked at her lovely face', " 'Well, maiden,' he snapped out, 'do you know who I am? I am King Frost, king of the red-noses", "' 'All hail to you, great King!' answered the girl, in a gentle, trembling voice", " 'Have you come to take me?' 'Are you warm, maiden?' he replied", " 'Quite warm, King Frost,' she answered, though she shivered as she spoke", " Then King Frost stooped down, and bent over the girl, and the crackling sound grew louder, and the air seemed to be full of knives and darts; and again he asked: 'Maiden, are you warm? Are you warm, you beautiful girl?' And though her breath was almost frozen on her lips, she whispered gently, 'Quite warm, King Frost", "' Then King Frost gnashed his teeth, and cracked his fingers, and his eyes sparkled, and the crackling, crisp sound was louder than ever, and for the last time he asked her: 'Maiden, are you still warm? Are you still warm, little love?' And the poor girl was so stiff and numb that she could just gasp, 'Still warm, O King!' Now her gentle, courteous words and her uncomplaining ways touched King Frost, and he had pity on her, and he wrapped her up in furs, and covered her with blankets, and he fetched a great box, in which were beautiful jewels and a rich robe embroidered in gold and silver", ' And she put it on, and looked more lovely than ever, and King Frost stepped with her into his sledge, with six white horses', " In the meantime the wicked step-mother was waiting at home for news of the girl's death, and preparing pancakes for the funeral feast", " And she said to her husband: 'Old man, you had better go out into the fields and find your daughter's body and bury her", "' Just as the old man was leaving the house the little dog under the table began to bark, saying:   'YOUR daughter shall live to be your delight;    HER daughter shall die this very night", "' 'Hold your tongue, you foolish beast!' scolded the woman", ' \'There\'s a pancake for you, but you must say:   "HER daughter shall have much silver and gold;    HIS daughter is frozen quite stiff and cold "\' But the doggie ate up the pancake and barked, saying:   \'His daughter shall wear a crown on her head;    Her daughter shall die unwooed, unwed', "' Then the old woman tried to coax the doggie with more pancakes and to terrify it with blows, but he barked on, always repeating the same words", ' And suddenly the door creaked and flew open, and a great heavy chest was pushed in, and behind it came the step-daughter, radiant and beautiful, in a dress all glittering with silver and gold', " For a moment the step-mother's eyes were dazzled", " Then she called to her husband: 'Old man, yoke the horses at once into the sledge, and take my daughter to the same field and leave her on the same spot exactly; 'and so the old man took the girl and left her beneath the same tree where he had parted from his daughter", " In a few minutes King Frost came past, and, looking at the girl, he said: 'Are you warm, maiden?' 'What a blind old fool you must be to ask such a question!' she answered angrily", " 'Can't you see that my hands and feet are nearly frozen?' Then King Frost sprang to and fro in front of her, questioning her, and getting only rude, rough words in reply, till at last he got very angry, and cracked his fingers, and gnashed his teeth, and froze her to death" ,  ' Far away over the sea of the West there reigned a king who had two sons; and the name of the one was Oireal, and the name of the other was Iarlaid  When the boys were still children, their father and mother died, and a great council was held, and a man was chosen from among them who would rule the kingdom till the boys were old enough to rule it themselves', " The years passed on, and by-and-by another council was held, and it was agreed that the king's sons were now of an age to take the power which rightly belonged to them", ' So the youths were bidden to appear before the council, and Oireal the elder was smaller and weaker than his brother', " 'I like not to leave the deer on the hill and the fish in the rivers, and sit in judgment on my people,' said Oireal, when he had listened to the words of the chief of the council", " And the chief waxed angry, and answered quickly: 'Not one clod of earth shall ever be yours if this day you do not take on yourself the vows that were taken by the king your father", "' Then spake Iarlaid, the younger, and he said: 'Let one half be yours, and the other give to me; then you will have fewer people to rule over", "' 'Yes, I will do that,' answered Oireal", ' After this, one half of the men of the land of Lochlann did homage to Oireal, and the other half to Iarlaid  And they governed their kingdoms as they would, and in a few years they became grown men with beards on their chins; and Iarlaid married the daughter of the king of Greece, and Oireal the daughter of the king of Orkney  The next year sons were born to Oireal and Iarlaid; and the son of Oireal was big and strong, but the son of Iarlaid was little and weak, and each had six foster brothers who went everywhere with the princes  One day Manus, son of Oireal, and his cousin, the son of Iarlaid, called to their foster brothers, and bade them come and play a game at shinny in the great field near the school where they were taught all that princes and nobles should know  Long they played, and swiftly did the ball pass from one to another, when Manus drove the ball at his cousin, the son of Iarlaid  The boy, who was not used to be roughly handled, even in jest, cried out that he was sorely hurt, and went home with his foster brothers and told his tale to his mother  The wife of Iarlaid grew white and angry as she listened, and thrusting her son aside, sought the council hall where Iarlaid was sitting', " 'Manus has driven a ball at my son, and fain would have slain him,' said she", " 'Let an end be put to him and his ill deeds", "' But Iarlaid answered: 'Nay, I will not slay the son of my brother", "' 'And he shall not slay my son,' said the queen", ' And calling to her chamberlain she ordered him to lead the prince to the four brown boundaries of the world, and to leave him there with a wise man, who would care for him, and let no harm befall him  And the wise man set the boy on the top of a hill where the sun always shone, and he could see every man, but no man could see him  Then she summoned Manus to the castle, and for a whole year she kept him fast, and his own mother could not get speech of him  But in the end, when the wife of Oireal fell sick, Manus fled from the tower which was his prison, and stole back to his on home  For a few years he stayed there in peace, and then the wife of Iarlaid his uncle sent for him', " 'It is time that you were married,' she said, when she saw that Manus had grown tall and strong like unto Iarlaid", " 'Tall and strong you are, and comely of face", ' I know a bride that will suit you well, and that is the daughter of the mighty earl of Finghaidh, that does homage for his lands to me  I myself will go with a great following to his house, and you shall go with me', "' Thus it was done; and though the earl's wife was eager to keep her daughter with her yet a while, she was fain to yield, as the wife of Iarlaid vowed that not a rood of land should the earl have, unless he did her bidding", ' But if he would give his daughter to Manus, she would bestow on him the third part of her own kingdom, with much treasure beside  There was a sultan, who had three sons and a niece  The eldest of the Princes was called Houssain, the second Ali, the youngest Ahmed, and the Princess, his niece, Nouronnihar  The Princess Nouronnihar was the daughter of the younger brother of the Sultan, who died, and left the Princess very young', " The Sultan took upon himself the care of his daughter's education, and brought her up in his palace with the three Princes, proposing to marry her when she arrived at a proper age, and to contract an alliance with some neighboring prince by that means", ' But when he perceived that the three Princes, his sons, loved her passionately, he thought more seriously on that affair  He was very much concerned; the difficulty he foresaw was to make them agree, and that the two youngest should consent to yield her up to their elder brother  As he found them positively obstinate, he sent for them all together, and said to them: "Children, since for your good and quiet I have not been able to persuade you no longer to aspire to the Princess, your cousin, I think it would not be amiss if every one traveled separately into different countries, so that you might not meet each other', " And, as you know I am very curious, and delight in everything that's singular, I promise my niece in marriage to him that shall bring me the most extraordinary rarity; and for the purchase of the rarity you shall go in search after, and the expense of traveling, I will give you every one a sum of money", '" As the three Princes were always submissive and obedient to the Sultan\'s will, and each flattered himself fortune might prove favorable to him, they all consented to it  The Sultan paid them the money he promised them; and that very day they gave orders for the preparations for their travels, and took their leave of the Sultan, that they might be the more ready to go the next morning  Accordingly they all set out at the same gate of the city, each dressed like a merchant, attended by an officer of confidence dressed like a slave, and all well mounted and equipped', " They went the first day's journey together, and lay all at an inn, where the road was divided into three different tracts", ' At night, when they were at supper together, they all agreed to travel for a year, and to meet at that inn; and that the first that came should wait for the rest; that, as they had all three taken their leave together of the Sultan, they might all return together  The next morning by break of day, after they had embraced and wished each other good success, they mounted their horses and took each a different road  Prince Houssain, the eldest brother, arrived at Bisnagar, the capital of the kingdom of that name, and the residence of its king', " He went and lodged at a khan appointed for foreign merchants; and, having learned that there were four principal divisions where merchants of all sorts sold their commodities, and kept shops, and in the midst of which stood the castle, or rather the King's palace, he went to one of these divisions the next day", ' Prince Houssain could not view this division without admiration  It was large, and divided into several streets, all vaulted and shaded from the sun, and yet very light too  The shops were all of a size, and all that dealt in the same sort of goods lived in one street; as also the handicrafts-men, who kept their shops in the smaller streets  The multitude of shops, stocked with all sorts of merchandise, as the finest linens from several parts of India, some painted in the most lively colors, and representing beasts, trees, and flowers; silks and brocades from Persia, China, and other places, porcelain both from Japan and China, and tapestries, surprised him so much that he knew not how to believe his own eyes; but when he came to the goldsmiths and jewelers he was in a kind of ecstacy to behold such prodigious quantities of wrought gold and silver, and was dazzled by the lustre of the pearls, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and other jewels exposed to sale  Another thing Prince Houssain particularly admired was the great number of rose-sellers who crowded the streets; for the Indians are so great lovers of that flower that no one will stir without a nosegay in his hand or a garland on his head; and the merchants keep them in pots in their shops, that the air is perfectly perfumed  After Prince Houssain had run through that division, street by street, his thoughts fully employed on the riches he had seen, he was very much tired, which a merchant perceiving, civilly invited him to sit down in his shop, and he accepted; but had not been sat down long before he saw a crier pass by with a piece of tapestry on his arm, about six feet square, and cried at thirty purses  The Prince called to the crier, and asked to see the tapestry, which seemed to him to be valued at an exorbitant price, not only for the size of it, but the meanness of the stuff; when he had examined it well, he told the crier that he could not comprehend how so small a piece of tapestry, and of so indifferent appearance, could be set at so high a price  The crier, who took him for a merchant, replied: "If this price seems so extravagant to you, your amazement will be greater when I tell you I have orders to raise it to forty purses, and not to part with it under " "Certainly," answered Prince Houssain, "it must have something very extraordinary in it, which I know nothing of " "You have guessed it, sir," replied the crier, "and will own it when you come to know that whoever sits on this piece of tapestry may be transported in an instant wherever he desires to be, without being stopped by any obstacle " At this discourse of the crier the Prince of the Indies, considering that the principal motive of his travel was to carry the Sultan, his father, home some singular rarity, thought that he could not meet with any which could give him more satisfaction  "If the tapestry," said he to the crier, "has the virtue you assign it, I shall not think forty purses too much, but shall make you a present besides " "Sir," replied the crier, "I have told you the truth; and it is an easy matter to convince you of it, as soon as you have made the bargain for forty purses, on condition I show you the experiment  But, as I suppose you have not so much about you, and to receive them I must go with you to your khan, where you lodge, with the leave of the master of the shop, we will go into the back shop, and I will spread the tapestry; and when we have both sat down, and you have formed the wish to be transported into your apartment of the khan, if we are not transported thither it shall be no bargain, and you shall be at your liberty  Many, many years ago there lived in Nara, the ancient Capital of Japan, a wise State minister, by name Prince Toyonari Fujiwara  His wife was a noble, good, and beautiful woman called Princess Murasaki (Violet)  They had been married by their respective families according to Japanese custom when very young, and had lived together happily ever since  They had, however, one cause for great sorrow, for as the years went by no child was born to them  This made them very unhappy, for they both longed to see a child of their own who would grow up to gladden their old age, carry on the family name, and keep up the ancestral rites when they were dead  The Prince and his lovely wife, after long consultation and much thought, determined to make a pilgrimage to the temple of Hase-no-Kwannon (Goddess of Mercy at Hase), for they believed, according to the beautiful tradition of their religion, that the Mother of Mercy, Kwannon, comes to answer the prayers of mortals in the form that they need the most  Surely after all these years of prayer she would come to them in the form of a beloved child in answer to their special pilgrimage, for that was the greatest need of their two lives  Everything else they had that this life could give them, but it was all as nothing because the cry of their hearts was unsatisfied  So the Prince Toyonari and his wife went to the temple of Kwannon at Hase and stayed there for a long time, both daily offering incense and praying to Kwannon, the Heavenly Mother, to grant them the desire of their whole lives  And their prayer was answered  A daughter was born at last to the Princess Murasaki, and great was the joy of her heart  On presenting the child to her husband, they both decided to call her Hase-Hime, or the Princess of Hase, because she was the gift of the Kwannon at that place  They both reared her with great care and tenderness, and the child grew in strength and beauty  When the little girl was five years old her mother fell dangerously ill and all the doctors and their medicines could not save her  A little before she breathed her last she called her daughter to her, and gently stroking her head, said: "Hase-Hime, do you know that your mother cannot live any longer? Though I die, you must grow up a good girl  Do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family  Perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother', " If so do not grieve for me, but look upon your father's second wife as your true mother, and be obedient and filial to both her and your father", ' Remember when you are grown up to be submissive to those who are your superiors, and to be kind to all those who are under you', " Don't forget this", ' I die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman " Hase-Hime listened in an attitude of respect while her mother spoke, and promised to do all that she was told  There is a proverb which says "As the soul is at three so it is at one hundred," and so Hase-Hime grew up as her mother had wished, a good and obedient little Princess, though she was now too young to understand how great was the loss of her mother  Not long after the death of his first wife, Prince Toyonari married again, a lady of noble birth named Princess Terute  Very different in character, alas! to the good and wise Princess Murasaki, this woman had a cruel, bad heart  She did not love her step-daughter at all, and was often very unkind to the little motherless girl, saving to herself: "This is not my child! this is not my child!" But Hase-Hime bore every unkindness with patience, and even waited upon her step-mother kindly and obeyed her in every way and never gave any trouble, just as she had been trained by her own good mother, so that the Lady Terute had no cause for complaint against her  The little Princess was very diligent, and her favorite studies were music and poetry  She would spend several hours practicing every day, and her father had the most proficient of masters he could find to teach her the koto (Japanese harp), the art of writing letters and verse  When she was twelve years of age she could play so beautifully that she and her step-mother were summoned to the Palace to perform before the Emperor  It was the Festival of the Cherry Flowers, and there were great festivities at the Court  The insignia of the great Japanese Empire is composed of three treasures which have been considered sacred, and guarded with jealous care from time immemorial  These are the Yatano-no-Kagami or the Mirror of Yata, the Yasakami-no-Magatama or the Jewel of Yasakami, and the Murakumo-no-Tsurugi or the Sword of Murakumo  Of these three treasures of the Empire, the sword of Murakumo, afterwards known as Kusanagi-no-Tsrugugi, or the grass-cleaving sword, is considered the most precious and most highly to be honored, for it is the symbol of strength to this nation of warriors and the talisman of invincibility for the Emperor, while he holds it sacred in the shrine of his ancestors  Nearly two thousand years ago this sword was kept at the shrines of Ite, the temples dedicated to the worship of Amaterasu, the great and beautiful Sun Goddess from whom the Japanese Emperors are said to be descended  There is a story of knightly adventure and daring which explains why the name of the sword was changed from that of Murakumo to Kasanagi, which means grass clearing  Once, many, many years ago, there was born a son to the Emperor Keiko, the twelfth in descent from the great Jimmu, the founder of the Japanese dynasty  This Prince was the second son of the Emperor Keiko, and he was named Yamato  From his childhood he proved himself to be of remarkable strength, wisdom and courage, and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great things, and he loved him even more than he did his elder son', " Now when Prince Yamato had grown to manhood (in the olden days of Japanese history, a boy was considered to have reached man's estate at the early age of sixteen) the realm was much troubled by a band of outlaws whose chiefs were two brothers, Kumaso and Takeru", ' These rebels seemed to delight in rebelling against the King, in breaking the laws and defying all authority  At last King Keiko ordered his younger son Prince Yamato to subdue the brigands and, if possible, to rid the land of their evil lives  Prince Yamato was only sixteen years of age, he had but reached his manhood according to the law, yet though he was such a youth in years he possessed the dauntless spirit of a warrior of fuller age and knew not what fear was', " Even then there was no man who could rival him for courage and bold deeds, and he received his father's command with great joy", ' He at once made ready to start, and great was the stir in the precincts of the Palace as he and his trusty followers gathered together and prepared for the expedition, and polished up their armor and donned it', " Before he left his father's Court he went to pray at the shrine of Ise and to take leave of his aunt the Princess Yamato, for his heart was somewhat heavy at the thought of the dangers he had to face, and he felt that he needed the protection of his ancestress, Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess", ' The Princess his aunt came out to give him glad welcome, and congratulated him on being trusted with so great a mission by his father the King  She then gave him one of her gorgeous robes as a keepsake to go with him and to bring him good luck, saying that it would surely be of service to him on this adventure  She then wished him all success in his undertaking and bade him good speed  The young Prince bowed low before his aunt, and received her gracious gift with much pleasure and many respectful bows  "I will now set out," said the Prince, and returning to the Palace he put himself at the head of his troops', " Thus cheered by his aunt's blessing, he felt ready for all that might befall, and marching through the land he went down to the Southern Island of Kiushiu, the home of the brigands", ' Before many days had passed he reached the Southern Island, and then slowly but surely made his way to the head-quarters of the chiefs Kumaso and Takeru  He now met with great difficulties, for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough  The mountains were high and steep, the valleys dark and deep, and huge trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped the progress of his army  It was all but impossible to go on  Though the Prince was but a youth he had the wisdom of years, and, seeing that it was vain to try and lead his men further, he said to himself: "To attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my men only makes my task harder  We cannot clear the roads and fight as well  It is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares  In that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion " So he now bade his army halt by the way  The Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, was much pleased with the tale of the blind man and the dervish, and when it was finished he turned to the young man who had ill-treated his horse, and inquired his name also  The young man replied that he was called Sidi-Nouman  "Sidi-Nouman," observed the Caliph, "I have seen horses broken all my life long, and have even broken them myself, but I have never seen any horse broken in such a barbarous manner as by you yesterday  Every one who looked on was indignant, and blamed you loudly  As for myself, I was so angry that I was very nearly disclosing who I was, and putting a stop to it at once  Still, you have not the air of a cruel man, and I would gladly believe that you did not act in this way without some reason  As I am told that it was not the first time, and indeed that every day you are to be seen flogging and spurring your horse, I wish to come to the bottom of the matter  But tell me the whole truth, and conceal nothing " Sidi-Nouman changed colour as he heard these words, and his manner grew confused; but he saw plainly that there was no help for it  So he prostrated himself before the throne of the Caliph and tried to obey, but the words stuck in his throat, and he remained silent', " The Caliph, accustomed though he was to instant obedience, guessed something of what was passing in the young man's mind, and sought to put him at his ease", ' "Sidi-Nouman," he said, "do not think of me as the Caliph, but merely as a friend who would like to hear your story  If there is anything in it that you are afraid may offend me, take courage, for I pardon you beforehand  Speak then openly and without fear, as to one who knows and loves you " Reassured by the kindness of the Caliph, Sidi-Nouman at length began his tale  "Commander of the Faithful," said he, "dazzled though I am by the lustre of your Highness\' presence, I will do my best to satisfy your wishes  I am by no means perfect, but I am not naturally cruel, neither do I take pleasure in breaking the law  I admit that the treatment of my horse is calculated to give your Highness a bad opinion of me, and to set an evil example to others; yet I have not chastised it without reason, and I have hopes that I shall be judged more worthy of pity than punishment " Commander of the Faithful, I will not trouble to describe my birth; it is not of sufficient distinction to deserve your Highness\' attention  My ancestors were careful people, and I inherited enough money to enable me to live comfortably, though without show  Having therefore a modest fortune, the only thing wanting to my happiness was a wife who could return my affection, but this blessing I was not destined to get; for on the very day after my marriage, my bride began to try my patience in every way that was most hard to bear  Now, seeing that the customs of our land oblige us to marry without ever beholding the person with whom we are to pass our lives, a man has of course no right to complain as long as his wife is not absolutely repulsive, or is not positively deformed  And whatever defects her body may have, pleasant ways and good behaviour will go far to remedy them  The first time I saw my wife unveiled, when she had been brought to my house with the usual ceremonies, I was enchanted to find that I had not been deceived in regard to the account that had been given me of her beauty  I began my married life in high spirits, and the best hopes of happiness  The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife did not appear, I ordered a servant to call her  Still she did not come, and I waited impatiently for some time  At last she entered the room, and she took our places at the table, and plates of rice were set before us  I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but great was my surprise to notice that my wife, instead of doing the same, drew from her pocket a little case, from which she selected a long pin, and by the help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth  "Amina," I exclaimed in astonishment, "is that the way you eat rice at home? And did you do it because your appetite was so small, or did you wish to count the grains so that you might never eat more than a certain number? If it was from economy, and you are anxious to teach me not to be wasteful, you have no cause for alarm  ONCE upon a time there was a King in the North who had won many wars, but now he was old  Yet he took a new wife, and then another Prince, who wanted to have married her, came up against him with a great army  The old King went out and fought bravely, but at last his sword broke, and he was wounded and his men fled  But in the night, when the battle was over, his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain, and at last she found him, and asked whether he might be healed', " But he said 'No,' his luck was gone, his sword was broken, and he must die", ' And he told her that she would have a son, and that son would be a great warrior, and would avenge him on the other King, his enemy  And he bade her keep the broken pieces of the sword, to make a new sword for his son, and that blade should be called Gram  Then he died', " And his wife called her maid to her and said, 'Let us change clothes, and you shall be called by my name, and I by yours, lest the enemy finds us", "' So this was done, and they hid in a wood, but there some strangers met them and carried them off in a ship to Denmark", ' And when they were brought before the King, he thought the maid looked like a Queen, and the Queen like a maid', " So he asked the Queen, 'How do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning?' And she said: 'I know because, when I was younger, I used to have to rise and light the fires, and still I waken at the same time", "' 'A strange Queen to light the fires,' thought the King", " Then he asked the Queen, who was dressed like a maid, 'How do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing near the dawn?' 'My father gave me a gold ring,' said she, 'and always, ere the dawning, it grows cold on my finger", "' 'A rich house where the maids wore gold,' said the King", " 'Truly you are no maid, but a King's daughter", "' So he treated her royally, and as time went on she had a son called Sigurd, a beautiful boy and very strong", ' He had a tutor to be with him, and once the tutor bade him go to the King and ask for a horse', " 'Choose a horse for yourself,' said the King; and Sigurd went to the wood, and there he met an old man with a white beard, and said, 'Come! help me in horse-choosing", "' Then the old man said, 'Drive all the horses into the river, and choose the one that swims across", "' So Sigurd drove them, and only one swam across", " Sigurd chose him: his name was Grani, and he came of Sleipnir's breed, and was the best horse in the world", ' For Sleipnir was the horse of Odin, the God of the North, and was as swift as the wind', " But a day or two later his tutor said to Sigurd, 'There is a great treasure of gold hidden not far from here, and it would become you to win it", "' But Sigurd answered, 'I have heard stories of that treasure, and I know that the dragon Fafnir guards it, and he is so huge and wicked that no man dares to go near him", "' 'He is no bigger than other dragons,' said the tutor, 'and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him", "' 'I am no coward,' says Sigurd; 'why do you want me to fight with this dragon?' Then his tutor, whose name was Regin, told him that all this great hoard of red gold had once belonged to his own father", ' And his father had three sons--the first was Fafnir, the Dragon; the next was Otter, who could put on the shape of an otter when he liked; and the next was himself, Regin, and he was a great smith and maker of swords  Now there was at that time a dwarf called Andvari, who lived in a pool beneath a waterfall, and there he had hidden a great hoard of gold  And one day Otter had been fishing there, and had killed a salmon and eaten it, and was sleeping, like an otter, on a stone  As long as our father lived Alnaschar was very idle  Instead of working for his bread he was not ashamed to ask for it every evening, and to support himself next day on what he had received the night before  When our father died, worn out by age, he only left seven hundred silver drachmas to be divided amongst us, which made one hundred for each son  Alnaschar, who had never possessed so much money in his life, was quite puzzled to know what to do with it  After reflecting upon the matter for some time he decided to lay it out on glasses, bottles, and things of that sort, which he would buy from a wholesale merchant  Having bought his stock he next proceeded to look out for a small shop in a good position, where he sat down at the open door, his wares being piled up in an uncovered basket in front of him, waiting for a customer among the passers-by  In this attitude he remained seated, his eyes fixed on the basket, but his thoughts far away  Unknown to himself he began to talk out loud, and a tailor, whose shop was next door to his, heard quite plainly what he was saying  "This basket," said Alnaschar to himself, "has cost me a hundred drachmas--all that I possess in the world  Now in selling the contents piece by piece I shall turn two hundred, and these hundreds I shall again lay out in glass, which will produce four hundred  By this means I shall in course of time make four thousand drachmas, which will easily double themselves  When I have got ten thousand I will give up the glass trade and become a jeweller, and devote all my time to trading in pearls, diamonds, and other precious stones  At last, having all the wealth that heart can desire, I will buy a beautiful country house, with horses and slaves, and then I will lead a merry life and entertain my friends  At my feasts I will send for musicians and dancers from the neighbouring town to amuse my guests', " In spite of my riches I shall not, however, give up trade till I have amassed a capital of a hundred thousand drachmas, when, having become a man of much consideration, I shall request the hand of the grand-vizir's daughter, taking care to inform the worthy father that I have heard favourable reports of her beauty and wit, and that I will pay down on our wedding day 3 thousand gold pieces", ' Should the vizir refuse my proposal, which after all is hardly to be expected, I will seize him by the beard and drag him to my house " When I shall have married his daughter I will give her ten of the best eunuchs that can be found for her service  Then I shall put on my most gorgeous robes, and mounted on a horse with a saddle of fine gold, and its trappings blazing with diamonds, followed by a train of slaves, I shall present myself at the house of the grand-vizir, the people casting down their eyes and bowing low as I pass along', " At the foot of the grand-vizir's staircase I shall dismount, and while my servants stand in a row to right and left I shall ascend the stairs, at the head of which the grand-vizir will be waiting to receive me", ' He will then embrace me as his son-in-law, and giving me his seat will place himself below me  This being done (as I have every reason to expect), two of my servants will enter, each bearing a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold  One of these I shall present to him saying, "Here are the thousand gold pieces that I offered for your daughter\'s hand, and here," I shall continue, holding out the second purse, "are another thousand to show you that I am a man who is better than his word " After hearing of such generosity the world will talk of nothing else  I shall return home with the same pomp as I set out, and my wife will send an officer to compliment me on my visit to her father, and I shall confer on the officer the honour of a rich dress and a handsome gift  Should she send one to me I shall refuse it and dismiss the bearer  I shall never allow my wife to leave her rooms on any pretext whatever without my permission, and my visits to her will be marked by all the ceremony calculated to inspire respect  No establishment will be better ordered than mine, and I shall take care always to be dressed in a manner suitable to my position  In the evening, when we retire to our apartments, I shall sit in the place of honour, where I shall assume a grand demeanour and speak little, gazing straight before me, and when my wife, lovely as the full moon, stands humbly in front of my chair I shall pretend not to see her  Then her women will say to me, "Respected lord and master, your wife and slave is before you waiting to be noticed  She is mortified that you never deign to look her way; she is tired of standing so long  There now remains for me to relate to you the story of my sixth brother, whose name was Schacabac  Like the rest of us, he inherited a hundred silver drachmas from our father, which he thought was a large fortune, but through ill-luck, he soon lost it all, and was driven to beg  As he had a smooth tongue and good manners, he really did very well in his new profession, and he devoted himself specially to making friends with the servants in big houses, so as to gain access to their masters  One day he was passing a splendid mansion, with a crowd of servants lounging in the courtyard  He thought that from the appearance of the house it might yield him a rich harvest, so he entered and inquired to whom it belonged  "My good man, where do you come from?" replied the servant  "Can\'t you see for yourself that it can belong to nobody but a Barmecide?" for the Barmecides were famed for their liberality and generosity  My brother, hearing this, asked the porters, of whom there were several, if they would give him alms  They did not refuse, but told him politely to go in, and speak to the master himself  My brother thanked them for their courtesy and entered the building, which was so large that it took him some time to reach the apartments of the Barmecide  At last, in a room richly decorated with paintings, he saw an old man with a long white beard, sitting on a sofa, who received him with such kindness that my brother was emboldened to make his petition  "My lord," he said, "you behold in me a poor man who only lives by the help of persons as rich and as generous as you " Before he could proceed further, he was stopped by the astonishment shown by the Barmecide  "Is it possible," he cried, "that while I am in Bagdad, a man like you should be starving? That is a state of things that must at once be put an end to! Never shall it be said that I have abandoned you, and I am sure that you, on your part, will never abandon me " "My lord," answered my brother, "I swear that I have not broken my fast this whole day " "What, you are dying of hunger?" exclaimed the Barmecide  "Here, slave; bring water, that we may wash our hands before meat!" No slave appeared, but my brother remarked that the Barmecide did not fail to rub his hands as if the water had been poured over them  Then he said to my brother, "Why don\'t you wash your hands too?" and Schacabac, supposing that it was a joke on the part of the Barmecide (though he could see none himself), drew near, and imitated his motion  When the Barmecide had done rubbing his hands, he raised his voice, and cried, "Set food before us at once, we are very hungry " No food was brought, but the Barmecide pretended to help himself from a dish, and carry a morsel to his mouth, saying as he did so, "Eat, my friend, eat, I entreat  Help yourself as freely as if you were at home! For a starving man, you seem to have a very small appetite " "Excuse me, my lord," replied Schacabac, imitating his gestures as before, "I really am not losing time, and I do full justice to the repast " "How do you like this bread?" asked the Barmecide  "I find it particularly good myself " "Oh, my lord," answered my brother, who beheld neither meat nor bread, "never have I tasted anything so delicious " "Eat as much as you want," said the Barmecide  "I bought the woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of gold, so that I might never be without it " After ordering a variety of dishes (which never came) to be placed on the table, and discussing the merits of each one, the Barmecide declared that having dined so well, they would now proceed to take their wine  To this my brother at first objected, declaring that it was forbidden; but on the Barmecide insisting that it was out of the question that he should drink by himself, he consented to take a little  The Barmecide, however, pretended to fill their glasses so often, that my brother feigned that the wine had gone into his head, and struck the Barmecide such a blow on the head, that he fell to the ground  I was born, Commander of the Faithful, in Bagdad, and was left an orphan while I was yet a very young man, for my parents died within a few days of each other  I had inherited from them a small fortune, which I worked hard night and day to increase, till at last I found myself the owner of eighty camels  These I hired out to travelling merchants, whom I frequently accompanied on their various journeys, and always returned with large profits  One day I was coming back from Balsora, whither I had taken a supply of goods, intended for India, and halted at noon in a lonely place, which promised rich pasture for my camels  I was resting in the shade under a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards Balsora, sat down by my side, and I inquired whence he had come and to what place he was going  We soon made friends, and after we had asked each other the usual questions, we produced the food we had with us, and satisfied our hunger  While we were eating, the dervish happened to mention that in a spot only a little way off from where we were sitting, there was hidden a treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till they could carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full as if it had never been touched  At this news I became almost beside myself with joy and greed, and I flung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming: "Good dervish, I see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to you, therefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you? Alone and on foot, you could carry away a mere handful  But tell me where it is, and I will load my eighty camels with it, and give you one of them as a token of my gratitude " Certainly my offer does not sound very magnificent, but it was great to me, for at his words a wave of covetousness had swept over my heart, and I almost felt as if the seventy-nine camels that were left were nothing in comparison  The dervish saw quite well what was passing in my mind, but he did not show what he thought of my proposal  "My brother," he answered quietly, "you know as well as I do, that you are behaving unjustly  It was open to me to keep my secret, and to reserve the treasure for myself  But the fact that I have told you of its existence shows that I had confidence in you, and that I hoped to earn your gratitude for ever, by making your fortune as well as mine  But before I reveal to you the secret of the treasure, you must swear that, after we have loaded the camels with as much as they can carry, you will give half to me, and let us go our own ways  I think you will see that this is fair, for if you present me with forty camels, I on my side will give you the means of buying a thousand more " I could not of course deny that what the dervish said was perfectly reasonable, but, in spite of that, the thought that the dervish would be as rich as I was unbearable to me  Still there was no use in discussing the matter, and I had to accept his conditions or bewail to the end of my life the loss of immense wealth  So I collected my camels and we set out together under the guidance of the dervish  After walking some time, we reached what looked like a valley, but with such a narrow entrance that my camels could only pass one by one  The little valley, or open space, was shut up by two mountains, whose sides were formed of straight cliffs, which no human being could climb  When we were exactly between these mountains the dervish stopped  "Make your camels lie down in this open space," he said, "so that we can easily load them; then we will go to the treasure " I did what I was bid, and rejoined the dervish, whom I found trying to kindle a fire out of some dry wood  As soon as it was alight, he threw on it a handful of perfumes, and pronounced a few words that I did not understand, and immediately a thick column of smoke rose high into the air  He separated the smoke into two columns, and then I saw a rock, which stood like a pillar between the two mountains, slowly open, and a splendid palace appear within  But, Commander of the Faithful, the love of gold had taken such possession of my heart, that I could not even stop to examine the riches, but fell upon the first pile of gold within my reach and began to heap it into a sack that I had brought with me  The dervish likewise set to work, but I soon noticed that he confined himself to collecting precious stones, and I felt I should be wise to follow his example  At length the camels were loaded with as much as they could carry, and nothing remained but to seal up the treasure, and go our ways  Before, however, this was done, the dervish went up to a great golden vase, beautifully chased, and took from it a small wooden box, which he hid in the bosom of his dress, merely saying that it contained a special kind of ointment  In a town of moderate size, two men lived in neighbouring houses; but they had not been there very long before one man took such a hatred of the other, and envied him so bitterly, that the poor man determined to find another home, hoping that when they no longer met every day his enemy would forget all about him  So he sold his house and the little furniture it contained, and moved into the capital of the country, which was luckily at no great distance  About half a mile from this city he bought a nice little place, with a large garden and a fair-sized court, in the centre of which stood an old well  In order to live a quieter life, the good man put on the robe of a dervish, and divided his house into a quantity of small cells, where he soon established a number of other dervishes  The fame of his virtue gradually spread abroad, and many people, including several of the highest quality, came to visit him and ask his prayers  Of course it was not long before his reputation reached the ears of the man who envied him, and this wicked wretch resolved never to rest till he had in some way worked ill to the dervish whom he hated  So he left his house and his business to look after themselves, and betook himself to the new dervish monastery, where he was welcomed by the founder with all the warmth imaginable  The excuse he gave for his appearance was that he had come to consult the chief of the dervishes on a private matter of great importance  "What I have to say must not be overheard," he whispered; "command, I beg of you, that your dervishes retire into their cells, as night is approaching, and meet me in the court " The dervish did as he was asked without delay, and directly they were alone together the envious man began to tell a long story, edging, as they walked to and fro, always nearer to the well, and when they were quite close, he seized the dervish and dropped him in  He then ran off triumphantly, without having been seen by anyone, and congratulating himself that the object of his hatred was dead, and would trouble him no more  But in this he was mistaken! The old well had long been inhabited (unknown to mere human beings) by a set of fairies and genii, who caught the dervish as he fell, so that he received no hurt  The dervish himself could see nothing, but he took for granted that something strange had happened, or he must certainly have been dashed against the side of the well and been killed  He lay quite still, and in a moment he heard a voice saying, "Can you guess whom this man is that we have saved from death?" "No," replied several other voices  And the first speaker answered, "I will tell you  This man, from pure goodness of heart, forsook the town where he lived and came to dwell here, in the hope of curing one of his neighbours of the envy he felt towards him', " But his character soon won him the esteem of all, and the envious man's hatred grew, till he came here with the deliberate intention of causing his death", ' And this he would have done, without our help, the very day before the Sultan has arranged to visit this holy dervish, and to entreat his prayers for the princess, his daughter " "But what is the matter with the princess that she needs the dervish\'s prayers?" asked another voice  "She has fallen into the power of the genius Maimoum, the son of Dimdim," replied the first voice  "But it would be quite simple for this holy chief of the dervishes to cure her if he only knew! In his convent there is a black cat which has a tiny white tip to its tail  Now to cure the princess the dervish must pull out seven of these white hairs, burn three, and with their smoke perfume the head of the princess  This will deliver her so completely that Maimoum, the son of Dimdim, will never dare to approach her again " The fairies and genii ceased talking, but the dervish did not forget a word of all they had said; and when morning came he perceived a place in the side of the well which was broken, and where he could easily climb out  The dervishes, who could not imagine what had become of him, were enchanted at his reappearance  He told them of the attempt on his life made by his guest of the previous day, and then retired into his cell  He was soon joined here by the black cat of which the voice had spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his master  He took him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull seven white hairs out of his tail, and put them on one side till they were needed  The sun had not long risen before the Sultan, who was anxious to leave nothing undone that might deliver the princess, arrived with a large suite at the gate of the monastery, and was received by the dervishes with profound respect  The Sultan lost no time in declaring the object of his visit, and leading the chief of the dervishes aside, he said to him, "Noble scheik, you have guessed perhaps what I have come to ask you?" "Yes, sire," answered the dervish; "if I am not mistaken, it is the illness of the princess which has procured me this honour  In order, madam, to explain how I came to lose my right eye, and to wear the dress of a Calender, you must first know that I am the son of a king', " My father's only brother reigned over the neighbouring country, and had two children, a daughter and a son, who were of the same age as myself", " As I grew up, and was allowed more liberty, I went every year to pay a visit to my uncle's court, and usually stayed there about two months", ' In this way my cousin and I became very intimate, and were much attached to each other  The very last time I saw him he seemed more delighted to see me than ever, and gave a great feast in my honour  When we had finished eating, he said to me, "My cousin, you would never guess what I have been doing since your last visit to us! Directly after your departure I set a number of men to work on a building after my own design  It is now completed, and ready to be lived in  I should like to show it to you, but you must first swear two things: to be faithful to me, and to keep my secret " Of course I did not dream of refusing him anything he asked, and gave the promise without the least hesitation  He then bade me wait an instant, and vanished, returning in a few moments with a richly dressed lady of great beauty, but as he did not tell me her name, I thought it was better not to inquire', " We all three sat down to table and amused ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent things, and with drinking each other's health", ' Suddenly the prince said to me, "Cousin, we have no time to lose; be so kind as to conduct this lady to a certain spot, where you will find a dome-like tomb, newly built  You cannot mistake it  Go in, both of you, and wait till I come  I shall not be long " As I had promised I prepared to do as I was told, and giving my hand to the lady, I escorted her, by the light of the moon, to the place of which the prince had spoken  We had barely reached it when he joined us himself, carrying a small vessel of water, a pickaxe, and a little bag containing plaster  With the pickaxe he at once began to destroy the empty sepulchre in the middle of the tomb  One by one he took the stones and piled them up in a corner  When he had knocked down the whole sepulchre he proceeded to dig at the earth, and beneath where the sepulchre had been I saw a trap-door  He raised the door and I caught sight of the top of a spiral staircase; then he said, turning to the lady, "Madam, this is the way that will lead you down to the spot which I told you of " The lady did not answer, but silently descended the staircase, the prince following her  At the top, however, he looked at me  "My cousin," he exclaimed, "I do not know how to thank you for your kindness  Farewell " "What do you mean?" I cried  "I don\'t understand " "No matter," he replied, "go back by the path that you came " He would say no more, and, greatly puzzled, I returned to my room in the palace and went to bed  When I woke, and considered my adventure, I thought that I must have been dreaming, and sent a servant to ask if the prince was dressed and could see me  I am now going to begin my story (said the old man), so please attend  This hind that you see with me is my wife  We have no children of our own, therefore I adopted the son of a favorite slave, and determined to make him my heir  My wife, however, took a great dislike to both mother and child, which she concealed from me till too late  When my adopted son was about ten years old I was obliged to go on a journey', " Before I went I entrusted to my wife's keeping both the mother and child, and begged her to take care of them during my absence, which lasted a whole year", ' During this time she studied magic in order to carry out her wicked scheme  When she had learnt enough she took my son into a distant place and changed him into a calf  Then she gave him to my steward, and told him to look after a calf she had bought  She also changed the slave into a cow, which she sent to my steward  When I returned I inquired after my slave and the child  "Your slave is dead," she said, "and as for your son, I have not seen him for two months, and I do not know where he is " I was grieved to hear of my slave\'s death, but as my son had only disappeared, I thought I should soon find him  Eight months, however, passed, and still no tidings of him; then the feast of Bairam came  To celebrate it I ordered my steward to bring me a very fat cow to sacrifice  He did so  The cow that he brought was my unfortunate slave  I bound her, but just as I was about to kill her she began to low most piteously, and I saw that her eyes were streaming with tears  It seemed to me most extraordinary, and, feeling a movement of pity, I ordered the steward to lead her away and bring another  My wife, who was present, scoffed at my compassion, which made her malice of no avail  "What are you doing?" she cried  "Kill this cow  It is the best we have to sacrifice " To please her, I tried again, but again the animal\'s lows and tears disarmed me  "Take her away," I said to the steward, "and kill her; I cannot " The steward killed her, but on skinning her found that she was nothing but bones, although she appeared so fat  I was vexed  "Keep her for yourself," I said to the steward, "and if you have a fat calf, bring that in her stead " In a short time he brought a very fat calf, which, although I did not know it, was my son  It tried hard to break its cord and come to me  Sire, there was once upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor that he could scarcely manage to support his wife and three children  He went every day to fish very early, and each day he made a rule not to throw his nets more than four times  He started out one morning by moonlight and came to the sea-shore  He undressed and threw his nets, and as he was drawing them towards the bank he felt a great weight  He though he had caught a large fish, and he felt very pleased  But a moment afterwards, seeing that instead of a fish he only had in his nets the carcase of an ass, he was much disappointed  Vexed with having such a bad haul, when he had mended his nets, which the carcase of the ass had broken in several places, he threw them a second time  In drawing them in he again felt a great weight, so that he thought they were full of fish  But he only found a large basket full of rubbish  He was much annoyed  "O Fortune," he cried, "do not trifle thus with me, a poor fisherman, who can hardly support his family!" So saying, he threw away the rubbish, and after having washed his nets clean of the dirt, he threw them for the third time  But he only drew in stones, shells, and mud  He was almost in despair  Then he threw his nets for the fourth time  When he thought he had a fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble  There was no fish however, but he found a yellow pot, which by its weight seemed full of something, and he noticed that it was fastened and sealed with lead, with the impression of a seal  He was delighted  "I will sell it to the founder," he said; "with the money I shall get for it I shall buy a measure of wheat " He examined the jar on all sides; he shook it to see if it would rattle  But he heard nothing, and so, judging from the impression of the seal and the lid, he thought there must be something precious inside  To find out, he took his knife, and with a little trouble he opened it  He turned it upside down, but nothing came out, which surprised him very much  He set it in front of him, and whilst he was looking at it attentively, such a thick smoke came out that he had to step back a pace or two  This smoke rose up to the clouds, and stretching over the sea and the shore, formed a thick mist, which caused the fisherman much astonishment  When all the smoke was out of the jar it gathered itself together, and became a thick mass in which appeared a genius, twice as large as the largest giant  When he saw such a terrible-looking monster, the fisherman would like to have run away, but he trembled so with fright that he could not move a step  "Great king of the genii," cried the monster, "I will never again disobey you!" At these words the fisherman took courage  "What is this you are saying, great genius? Tell me your history and how you came to be shut up in that vase " At this, the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily  "Speak to me more civilly," he said, "before I kill you  Once upon a time, at the town of Senna on the banks of the Zambesi, was born a child  He was not like other children, for he was very tall and strong; over his shoulder he carried a big sack, and in his hand an iron hammer  He could also speak like a grown man, but usually he was very silent', " One day his mother said to him: 'My child, by what name shall we know you?' And he answered: 'Call all the head men of Senna here to the river's bank", "' And his mother called the head men of the town, and when they had come he led them down to a deep black pool in the river where all the fierce crocodiles lived", " 'O great men!' he said, while they all listened, 'which of you will leap into the pool and overcome the crocodiles?' But no one would come forward", ' So he turned and sprang into the water and disappeared', " The people held their breath, for they thought: 'Surely the boy is bewitched and throws away his life, for the crocodiles will eat him!' Then suddenly the ground trembled, and the pool, heaving and swirling, became red with blood, and presently the boy rising to the surface swam on shore", ' But he was no longer just a boy! He was stronger than any man and very tall and handsome, so that the people shouted with gladness when they saw him  \'Now, O my people!\' he cried, waving his hand, \'you know my name--I am Makoma, "the Greater"; for have I not slain the crocodiles into the pool where none would venture?\' Then he said to his mother: \'Rest gently, my mother, for I go to make a home for myself and become a hero', "' Then, entering his hut he took Nu-endo, his iron hammer, and throwing the sack over his shoulder, he went away", ' Makoma crossed the Zambesi, and for many moons he wandered towards the north and west until he came to a very hilly country where, one day, he met a huge giant making mountains  \'Greeting,\' shouted Makoma, \'you are you?\' \'I am Chi-eswa-mapiri, who makes the mountains,\' answered the giant; \'and who are you?\' \'I am Makoma, which signifies "greater,"\' answered he', " 'Greater than who?' asked the giant", " 'Greater than you!' answered Makoma", ' The giant gave a roar and rushed upon him  Makoma said nothing, but swinging his great hammer, Nu-endo, he struck the giant upon the head', " He struck him so hard a blow that the giant shrank into quite a little man, who fell upon his knees saying: 'You are indeed greater than I, O Makoma; take me with you to be your slave!' So Makoma picked him up and dropped him into the sack that he carried upon his back", " He was greater than ever now, for all the giant's strength had gone into him; and he resumed his journey, carrying his burden with as little difficulty as an eagle might carry a hare", ' Before long he came to a country broken up with huge stones and immense clods of earth   Looking over one of the heaps he saw a giant wrapped in dust dragging out the very earth and hurling it in handfuls on either side of him', " 'Who are you,' cried Makoma, 'that pulls up the earth in this way?' 'I am Chi-dubula-taka,' said he, 'and I am making the river-beds", "' 'Do you know who I am?' said Makoma", ' \'I am he that is called "greater"!\' \'Greater than who?\' thundered the giant', " 'Greater than you!' answered Makoma", ' With a shout, Chi-dubula-taka seized a great clod of earth and launched it at Makoma  But the hero had his sack held over his left arm and the stones and earth fell harmlessly upon it, and, tightly gripping his iron hammer, he rushed in and struck the giant to the ground  Chi-dubula-taka grovelled before him, all the while growing smaller and smaller; and when he had become a convenient size Makoma picked him up and put him into the sack beside Chi- eswa-mapiri', " He went on his way even greater than before, as all the river-maker's power had become his; and at last he came to a forest of bao- babs and thorn trees", ' He was astonished at their size, for every one was full grown and larger than any trees he had ever seen, and close by he saw Chi-gwisa-miti, the giant who was planting the forest  A good man had a beautiful wife, whom he loved passionately, and never left if possible  One day, when he was obliged by important business to go away from her, he went to a place where all kinds of birds are sold and bought a parrot  This parrot not only spoke well, but it had the gift of telling all that had been done before it  He brought it home in a cage, and asked his wife to put it in her room, and take great care of it while he was away  Then he departed  On his return he asked the parrot what had happened during his absence, and the parrot told him some things which made him scold his wife  She thought that one of her slaves must have been telling tales of her, but they told her it was the parrot, and she resolved to revenge herself on him', " When her husband next went away for one day, she told on slave to turn under the bird's cage a hand-mill; another to throw water down from above the cage, and a third to take a mirror and turn it in front of its eyes, from left to right by the light of a candle", ' The slaves did this for part of the night, and did it very well  The next day when the husband came back he asked the parrot what he had seen  The bird replied, "My good master, the lightning, thunder and rain disturbed me so much all night long, that I cannot tell you what I have suffered " The husband, who knew that it had neither rained nor thundered in the night, was convinced that the parrot was not speaking the truth, so he took him out of the cage and threw him so roughly on the ground that he killed him  Nevertheless he was sorry afterwards, for he found that the parrot had spoken the truth  "When the Greek king," said the fisherman to the genius, "had finished the story of the parrot, he added to the vizir, "And so, vizir, I shall not listen to you, and I shall take care of the physician, in case I repent as the husband did when he had killed the parrot " But the vizir was determined  "Sire," he replied, "the death of the parrot was nothing  But when it is a question of the life of a king it is better to sacrifice the innocent than save the guilty  It is no uncertain thing, however  The physician, Douban, wishes to assassinate you  My zeal prompts me to disclose this to your Majesty  If I am wrong, I deserve to be punished as a vizir was once punished " "What had the vizir done," said the Greek king, "to merit the punishment?" "I will tell your Majesty, if you will do me the honour to listen," answered the vizir "     Long, long ago there lived a man called Sentaro  His surname meant "Millionaire," but although he was not so rich as all that, he was still very far removed from being poor  He had inherited a small fortune from his father and lived on this, spending his time carelessly, without any serious thoughts of work, till he was about thirty-two years of age  One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of death and sickness came to him  The idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched  "I should like to live," he said to himself, "till I am five or six hundred years old at least, free from all sickness', " The ordinary span of a man's life is very short", '" He wondered whether it were possible, by living simply and frugally henceforth, to prolong his life as long as he wished  He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had lived a thousand years, and there was a Princess of Yamato, who, it was said, lived to the age of five hundred  This was the latest story of a very long life record  Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no-Shiko  He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history  He built all the large palaces, and also the famous great wall of China  He had everything in the world he could wish for, but in spite of all his happiness and the luxury and the splendor of his Court, the wisdom of his councilors and the glory of his reign, he was miserable because he knew that one day he must die and leave it all  When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night, when he rose in the morning, as he went through his day, the thought of death was always with him  He could not get away from it  Ah--if only he could find the "Elixir of Life," he would be happy  The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them all if they could not find for him the "Elixir of Life" of which he had so often read and heard  One old courtier, Jofuku by name, said that far away across the seas there was a country called Horaizan, and that certain hermits lived there who possessed the secret of the "Elixir of Life " Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever  The Emperor ordered Jofuku to set out for the land of Horaizan, to find the hermits, and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir  He gave Jofuku one of his best junks, fitted it out for him, and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for Jofuku to take as presents to the hermits  Jofuku sailed for the land of Horaizan, but he never returned to the waiting Emperor; but ever since that time Mount Fuji has been said to be the fabled Horaizan and the home of hermits who had the secret of the elixir, and Jofuku has been worshiped as their patron god  Now Sentaro determined to set out to find the hermits, and if he could, to become one, so that he might obtain the water of perpetual life  He remembered that as a child he had been told that not only did these hermits live on Mount Fuji, but that they were said to inhabit all the very high peaks  So he left his old home to the care of his relatives, and started out on his quest  He traveled through all the mountainous regions of the land, climbing to the tops of the highest peaks, but never a hermit did he find  At last, after wandering in an unknown region for many days, he met a hunter  "Can you tell me," asked Sentaro, "where the hermits live who have the Elixir of Life?" "No " said the hunter; "I can\'t tell you where such hermits live, but there is a notorious robber living in these parts  Sire, there was once upon a time a merchant who possessed great wealth, in land and merchandise, as well as in ready money  He was obliged from time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs  One day, having to go a long way from home, he mounted his horse, taking with him a small wallet in which he had put a few biscuits and dates, because he had to pass through the desert where no food was to be got  He arrived without any mishap, and, having finished his business, set out on his return  On the fourth day of his journey, the heat of the sun being very great, he turned out of his road to rest under some trees  He found at the foot of a large walnut-tree a fountain of clear and running water  He dismounted, fastened his horse to a branch of the tree, and sat by the fountain, after having taken from his wallet some of his dates and biscuits  When he had finished this frugal meal he washed his face and hands in the fountain  When he was thus employed he saw an enormous genius, white with rage, coming towards him, with a scimitar in his hand  "Arise," he cried in a terrible voice, "and let me kill you as you have killed my son!" As he uttered these words he gave a frightful yell  The merchant, quite as much terrified at the hideous face of the monster as at his words, answered him tremblingly, "Alas, good sir, what can I have done to you to deserve death?" "I shall kill you," repeated the genius, "as you have killed my son " "But," said the merchant, "how can I have killed your son? I do not know him, and I have never even seen him " "When you arrived here did you not sit down on the ground?" asked the genius, "and did you not take some dates from your wallet, and whilst eating them did not you throw the stones about?" "Yes," said the merchant, "I certainly did so " "Then," said the genius, "I tell you you have killed my son, for whilst you were throwing about the stones, my son passed by, and one of them struck him in the eye and killed him  So I shall kill you " "Ah, sir, forgive me!" cried the merchant  "I will have no mercy on you," answered the genius  "But I killed your son quite unintentionally, so I implore you to spare my life " "No," said the genius, "I shall kill you as you killed my son," and so saying, he seized the merchant by the arm, threw him on the ground, and lifted his sabre to cut off his head  The merchant, protesting his innocence, bewailed his wife and children, and tried pitifully to avert his fate  The genius, with his raised scimitar, waited till he had finished, but was not in the least touched  Scheherazade, at this point, seeing that it was day, and knowing that the Sultan always rose very early to attend the council, stopped speaking  "Indeed, sister," said Dinarzade, "this is a wonderful story " "The rest is still more wonderful," replied Scheherazade, "and you would say so, if the sultan would allow me to live another day, and would give me leave to tell it to you the next night " Schahriar, who had been listening to Scheherazade with pleasure, said to himself, "I will wait till to-morrow; I can always have her killed when I have heard the end of her story " All this time the grand-vizir was in a terrible state of anxiety  But he was much delighted when he saw the Sultan enter the council-chamber without giving the terrible command that he was expecting  The next morning, before the day broke, Dinarzade said to her sister, "Dear sister, if you are awake I pray you to go on with your story " The Sultan did not wait for Scheherazade to ask his leave  "Finish," said he, "the story of the genius and the merchant  Long, long ago there lived an old man and his wife who supported themselves by cultivating a small plot of land  Their life had been a very happy and peaceful one save for one great sorrow, and this was they had no child  Their only pet was a dog named Shiro, and on him they lavished all the affection of their old age  Indeed, they loved him so much that whenever they had anything nice to eat they denied themselves to give it to Shiro  Now Shiro means "white," and he was so called because of his color  He was a real Japanese dog, and very like a small wolf in appearance  The happiest hour of the day both for the old man and his dog was when the man returned from his work in the field, and having finished his frugal supper of rice and vegetables, would take what he had saved from the meal out to the little veranda that ran round the cottage  Sure enough, Shiro was waiting for his master and the evening tit-bit  Then the old man said "Chin, chin!" and Shiro sat up and begged, and his master gave him the food  Next door to this good old couple there lived another old man and his wife who were both wicked and cruel, and who hated their good neighbors and the dog Shiro with all their might  Whenever Shiro happened to look into their kitchen they at once kicked him or threw something at him, sometimes even wounding him', " One day Shiro was heard barking for a long time in the field at the back of his master's house", ' The old man, thinking that perhaps some birds were attacking the corn, hurried out to see what was the matter  As soon as Shiro saw his master he ran to meet him, wagging his tail, and, seizing the end of his kimono, dragged him under a large yenoki tree  Here he began to dig very industriously with his paws, yelping with joy all the time  The old man, unable to understand what it all meant, stood looking on in bewilderment  But Shiro went on barking and digging with all his might  The thought that something might be hidden beneath the tree, and that the dog had scented it, at last struck the old man  He ran back to the house, fetched his spade and began to dig the ground at that spot  What was his astonishment when, after digging for some time, he came upon a heap of old and valuable coins, and the deeper he dug the more gold coins did he find  So intent was the old man on his work that he never saw the cross face of his neighbor peering at him through the bamboo hedge  At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground  Shiro sat by erect with pride and looking fondly at his master as if to say, "You see, though only a dog, I can make some return for all the kindness you show me " The old man ran in to call his wife, and together they carried home the treasure  Thus in one day the poor old man became rich  His gratitude to the faithful dog knew no bounds, and he loved and petted him more than ever, if that were possible', " The cross old neighbor, attracted by Shiro's barking, had been an unseen and envious witness of the finding of the treasure", ' He began to think that he, too, would like to find a fortune', " So a few days later he called at the old man's house and very ceremoniously asked permission to borrow Shiro for a short time", " Shiro's master thought this a strange request, because he knew quite well that not only did his neighbor not love his pet dog, but that he never lost an opportunity of striking and tormenting him whenever the dog crossed his path" ,  ' "Madam," said the young man, addressing Zobeida, "if you wish to know how I lost my right eye, I shall have to tell you the story of my whole life " I was scarcely more than a baby, when the king my father, finding me unusually quick and clever for my age, turned his thoughts to my education  I was taught first to read and write, and then to learn the Koran, which is the basis of our holy religion, and the better to understand it, I read with my tutors the ablest commentators on its teaching, and committed to memory all the traditions respecting the Prophet, which have been gathered from the mouth of those who were his friends  I also learnt history, and was instructed in poetry, versification, geography, chronology, and in all the outdoor exercises in which every prince should excel  But what I liked best of all was writing Arabic characters, and in this I soon surpassed my masters, and gained a reputation in this branch of knowledge that reached as far as India itself  Now the Sultan of the Indies, curious to see a young prince with such strange tastes, sent an ambassador to my father, laden with rich presents, and a warm invitation to visit his court  My father, who was deeply anxious to secure the friendship of so powerful a monarch, and held besides that a little travel would greatly improve my manners and open my mind, accepted gladly, and in a short time I had set out for India with the ambassador, attended only by a small suite on account of the length of the journey, and the badness of the roads  However, as was my duty, I took with me ten camels, laden with rich presents for the Sultan  We had been travelling for about a month, when one day we saw a cloud of dust moving swiftly towards us; and as soon as it came near, we found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers  Our men barely numbered half, and as we were also hampered by the camels, there was no use in fighting, so we tried to overawe them by informing them who we were, and whither we were going  The robbers, however, only laughed, and declared that was none of their business, and, without more words, attacked us brutally  I defended myself to the last, wounded though I was, but at length, seeing that resistance was hopeless, and that the ambassador and all our followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my horse and rode away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell dead from a wound in his side  I managed to jump off without any injury, and looked about to see if I was pursued  But for the moment I was safe, for, as I imagined, the robbers were all engaged in quarrelling over their booty  I found myself in a country that was quite new to me, and dared not return to the main road lest I should again fall into the hands of the robbers  Luckily my wound was only a slight one, and after binding it up as well as I could, I walked on for the rest of the day, till I reached a cave at the foot of a mountain, where I passed the night in peace, making my supper off some fruits I had gathered on the way  I wandered about for a whole month without knowing where I was going, till at length I found myself on the outskirts of a beautiful city, watered by winding streams, which enjoyed an eternal spring  My delight at the prospect of mixing once more with human beings was somewhat damped at the thought of the miserable object I must seem  My face and hands had been burned nearly black; my clothes were all in rags, and my shoes were in such a state that I had been forced to abandon them altogether', " I entered the town, and stopped at a tailor's shop to inquire where I was", ' The man saw I was better than my condition, and begged me to sit down, and in return I told him my whole story  The tailor listened with attention, but his reply, instead of giving me consolation, only increased my trouble  "Beware," he said, "of telling any one what you have told me, for the prince who governs the kingdom is your father\'s greatest enemy, and he will be rejoiced to find you in his power " I thanked the tailor for his counsel, and said I would do whatever he advised; then, being very hungry, I gladly ate of the food he put before me, and accepted his offer of a lodging in his house  In a few days I had quite recovered from the hardships I had undergone, and then the tailor, knowing that it was the custom for the princes of our religion to learn a trade or profession so as to provide for themselves in times of ill-fortune, inquired if there was anything I could do for my living  I replied that I had been educated as a grammarian and a poet, but that my great gift was writing  "All that is of no use here," said the tailor  "Take my advice, put on a short coat, and as you seem hardy and strong, go into the woods and cut firewood, which you will sell in the streets  By this means you will earn your living, and be able to wait till better times come  The hatchet and the cord shall be my present  Great prince of the genii, you must know that we are three brothers--these two black dogs and myself  Our father died, leaving us each a thousand sequins  With this sum we all three took up the same profession, and became merchants  A short time after we had opened our shops, my eldest brother, one of these two dogs, resolved to travel in foreign countries for the sake of merchandise  With this intention he sold all he had and bought merchandise suitable to the voyages he was about to make  He set out, and was away a whole year  At the end of this time a beggar came to my shop  "Good-day," I said  "Good-day," he answered; "is it possible that you do not recognise me?" Then I looked at him closely and saw he was my brother  I made him come into my house, and asked him how he had fared in his enterprise  "Do not question me," he replied, "see me, you see all I have  It would but renew my trouble to tell of all the misfortunes that have befallen me in a year, and have brought me to this state " I shut up my shop, paid him every attention, taking him to the bath, giving him my most beautiful robes  I examined my accounts, and found that I had doubled my capital--that is, that I now possessed two thousand sequins  I gave my brother half, saying: "Now, brother, you can forget your losses " He accepted them with joy, and we lived together as we had before  Some time afterwards my second brother wished also to sell his business and travel  My eldest brother and I did all we could to dissuade him, but it was of no use  He joined a caravan and set out  He came back at the end of a year in the same state as his elder brother  I took care of him, and as I had a thousand sequins to spare I gave them to him, and he re-opened his shop  One day, my two brothers came to me to propose that we should make a journey and trade  At first I refused to go  "You travelled," I said, "and what did you gain?" But they came to me repeatedly, and after having held out for five years I at last gave way  But when they had made their preparation, and they began to buy the merchandise we needed, they found they had spent every piece of the thousand sequins I had given them  I did not reproach them  I divided my six thousand sequins with them, giving a thousand to each and keeping one for myself, and the other three I buried in a corner of my house  We bought merchandise, loaded a vessel with it, and set forth with a favorable wind', " After two months' sailing we arrived at a seaport, where we disembarked and did a great trade", ' Then we bought the merchandise of the country, and were just going to sail once more, when I was stopped on the shore by a beautiful though poorly dressed woman  Far, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there stood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he was rich and handsome  His great army was made up of men ready to obey his slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city he had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows  His council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose long beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned as a whole college  This council always told the king the exact truth  Now the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy anything because he could not find a bride to his mind  One day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed into the harbour and several merchants came on shore', " Said the king to himself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands", ' I will ask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome as I am', "' So he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came he said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders", ' I wish to ask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully', " 'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king, or a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be worthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?' The merchants considered for some time", " At last the eldest of them said: 'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a mighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she can certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the wisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles", "' 'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?' 'It is not near,' was the answer", " 'The journey would take ten years, and we do not know the way", ' And even if we did, what use would that be? The princess is no bride for you', "' 'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily", " 'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment", ' Should you send an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten more to return--twenty years in all', " Will not the princess have grown old in that time and have lost all her beauty?' The king reflected gravely", ' Then he thanked the merchants, gave them leave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed them  After they were gone the king remained deep in thought  He felt puzzled and anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his mind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers  The huntsmen blew their horns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all set out across country till they came to a green hedge  On the other side of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye could reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze like a rippling sea of gold  The king drew rein and admired the field', " 'Upon my word,' said he, 'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen", ' If all the fields in my kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread than my people could eat', "' And he wished to know to whom the field belonged", ' Off rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a nice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching on rye bread and drinking water  They wore red shirts bound with gold braid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from another  In the reign of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived at Bagdad a porter who, in spite of his humble calling, was an intelligent and sensible man  One morning he was sitting in his usual place with his basket before him, waiting to be hired, when a tall young lady, covered with a long muslin veil, came up to him and said, "Pick up your basket and follow me " The porter, who was greatly pleased by her appearance and voice, jumped up at once, poised his basket on his head, and accompanied the lady, saying to himself as he went, "Oh, happy day! Oh, lucky meeting!" The lady soon stopped before a closed door, at which she knocked  It was opened by an old man with a long white beard, to whom the lady held out money without speaking  The old man, who seemed to understand what she wanted, vanished into the house, and returned bringing a large jar of wine, which the porter placed in his basket  Then the lady signed to him to follow, and they went their way  The next place she stopped at was a fruit and flower shop, and here she bought a large quantity of apples, apricots, peaches, and other things, with lilies, jasmine, and all sorts of sweet-smelling plants  From this shop she went to a butcher\'s, a grocer\'s, and a poulterer\'s, till at last the porter exclaimed in despair, "My good lady, if you had only told me you were going to buy enough provisions to stock a town, I would have brought a horse, or rather a camel " The lady laughed, and told him she had not finished yet, but after choosing various kinds of scents and spices from a druggist\'s store, she halted before a magnificent palace, at the door of which she knocked gently  The porteress who opened it was of such beauty that the eyes of the man were quite dazzled, and he was the more astonished as he saw clearly that she was no slave  The lady who had led him hither stood watching him with amusement, till the porteress exclaimed, "Why don\'t you come in, my sister? This poor man is so heavily weighed down that he is ready to drop " When they were both inside the door was fastened, and they all three entered a large court, surrounded by an open-work gallery  At one end of the court was a platform, and on the platform stood an amber throne supported by four ebony columns, garnished with pearls and diamonds  In the middle of the court stood a marble basin filled with water from the mouth of a golden lion  The porter looked about him, noticing and admiring everything; but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting on the throne, who was even more beautiful than the other two  By the respect shown to her by the others, he judged that she must be the eldest, and in this he was right', " This lady's name was Zobeida, the porteress was Sadie, and the housekeeper was Amina", ' At a word from Zobeida, Sadie and Amina took the basket from the porter, who was glad enough to be relieved from its weight; and when it was emptied, paid him handsomely for its use  But instead of taking up his basket and going away, the man still lingered, till Zobeida inquired what he was waiting for, and if he expected more money  "Oh, madam," returned he, "you have already given me too much, and I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking my departure at once  But, if you will pardon my saying so, I was lost in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves  A company of women without men is, however, as dull as a company of men without women " And after telling some stories to prove his point, he ended by entreating them to let him stay and make a fourth at their dinner', " The ladies were rather amused at the man's assurances and after some discussion it was agreed that he should be allowed to stay, as his society might prove entertaining", ' "But listen, friend," said Zobeida, "if we grant your request, it is only on condition that you behave with the utmost politeness, and that you keep the secret of our way of living, which chance has revealed to you " Then they all sat down to table, which had been covered by Amina with the dishes she had bought  After the first few mouthfuls Amina poured some wine into a golden cup  She first drank herself, according to the Arab custom, and then filled it for her sisters', " When it came to the porter's turn he kissed Amina's hand, and sang a song, which he composed at the moment in praise of the wine", ' The three ladies were pleased with the song, and then sang themselves, so that the repast was a merry one, and lasted much longer than usual  There was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very fond of hunting  He often allowed him to indulge in this pastime, but he had ordered his grand-vizir always to go with him, and never to lose sight of him  One day the huntsman roused a stag, and the prince, thinking that the vizir was behind, gave chase, and rode so hard that he found himself alone  He stopped, and having lost sight of it, he turned to rejoin the vizir, who had not been careful enough to follow him  But he lost his way  Whilst he was trying to find it, he saw on the side of the road a beautiful lady who was crying bitterly', " He drew his horse's rein, and asked her who she was and what she was doing in this place, and if she needed help", ' "I am the daughter of an Indian king," she answered, "and whilst riding in the country I fell asleep and tumbled off  My horse has run away, and I do not know what has become of him " The young prince had pity on her, and offered to take her behind him, which he did  As they passed by a ruined building the lady dismounted and went in  The prince also dismounted and followed her  To his great surprise, he heard her saying to some one inside, "Rejoice my children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth " And other voices replied, "Where is he, mamma, that we may eat him at once, as we are very hungry?" The prince at once saw the danger he was in  He now knew that the lady who said she was the daughter of an Indian king was an ogress, who lived in desolate places, and who by a thousand wiles surprised and devoured passers-by  He was terrified, and threw himself on his horse  The pretended princess appeared at this moment, and seeing that she had lost her prey, she said to him, "Do not be afraid  What do you want?" "I am lost," he answered, "and I am looking for the road " "Keep straight on," said the ogress, "and you will find it " The prince could hardly believe his ears, and rode off as hard as he could', " He found his way, and arrived safe and sound at his father's house, where he told him of the danger he had run because of the grand-vizir's carelessness", ' The king was very angry, and had him strangled immediately  "Sire," went on the vizir to the Greek king, "to return to the physician, Douban  If you do not take care, you will repent of having trusted him  Who knows what this remedy, with which he has cured you, may not in time have a bad effect on you?" The Greek king was naturally very weak, and did not perceive the wicked intention of his vizir, nor was he firm enough to keep to his first resolution  "Well, vizir," he said, "you are right  Perhaps he did come to take my life  He might do it by the mere smell of one of his drugs  I must see what can be done " "The best means, sire, to put your life in security, is to send for him at once, and to cut off his head directly he comes," said the vizir "Near the shores of the great Belt, which is one of the straits that connect the Cattegat with the Baltic, stands an old mansion with thick red walls  I know every stone of it," says the Wind  "I saw it when it was part of the castle of Marck Stig on the promontory  But the castle was obliged to be pulled down, and the stone was used again for the walls of a new mansion on another spot--the baronial residence of Borreby, which still stands near the coast', " I knew them well, those noble lords and ladies, the successive generations that dwelt there; and now I'm going to tell you of Waldemar Daa and his daughters", ' How proud was his bearing, for he was of royal blood, and could boast of more noble deeds than merely hunting the stag and emptying the wine-cup', " His rule was despotic: 'It shall be,' he was accustomed to say", ' His wife, in garments embroidered with gold, stepped proudly over the polished marble floors  The tapestries were gorgeous, and the furniture of costly and artistic taste  She had brought gold and plate with her into the house  The cellars were full of wine  Black, fiery horses, neighed in the stables  There was a look of wealth about the house of Borreby at that time  They had three children, daughters, fair and delicate maidens--Ida, Joanna, and Anna Dorothea; I have never forgotten their names  They were a rich, noble family, born in affluence and nurtured in luxury  "Whir-r-r, whir-r-r!" roared the Wind, and went on, "I did not see in this house, as in other great houses, the high-born lady sitting among her women, turning the spinning-wheel  She could sweep the sounding chords of the guitar, and sing to the music, not always Danish melodies, but the songs of a strange land', " It was 'Live and let live,' here", ' Stranger guests came from far and near, music sounded, goblets clashed, and I," said the Wind, "was not able to drown the noise  Ostentation, pride, splendor, and display ruled, but not the fear of the Lord  "It was on the evening of the first day of May," the Wind continued, "I came from the west, and had seen the ships overpowered with the waves, when all on board persisted or were cast shipwrecked on the coast of Jutland', " I had hurried across the heath and over Jutland's wood-girt eastern coast, and over the island of Funen, and then I drove across the great belt, sighing and moaning", ' At length I lay down to rest on the shores of Zeeland, near to the great house of Borreby, where the splendid forest of oaks still flourished  The young men of the neighborhood were collecting branches and brushwood under the oak-trees  The largest and dryest they could find they carried into the village, and piled them up in a heap and set them on fire  Then the men and maidens danced, and sung in a circle round the blazing pile  I lay quite quiet," said the Wind, "but I silently touched a branch which had been brought by one of the handsomest of the young men, and the wood blazed up brightly, blazed brighter than all the rest  Then he was chosen as the chief, and received the name of the Shepherd; and might choose his lamb from among the maidens  There was greater mirth and rejoicing than I had ever heard in the halls of the rich baronial house', " Then the noble lady drove by towards the baron's mansion with her three daughters, in a gilded carriage drawn by six horses" ,  ' Down in the south, where the sun shines so hotly that everything and everybody sleeps all day, and even the great forests seem silent, except early in the morning and late in the evening--down in this country there once lived a young man and a maiden  The girl had been born in the town, and had scarcely ever left it; but the young man was a native of another country, and had only come to the city near the great river because he could find no work to do where he was  A few months after his arrival, when the days were cooler, and the people did not sleep so much as usual, a great feast was held a little way out of the town, and to this feast everyone flocked from thirty miles and more  Some walked and some rode, some came in beautiful golden coaches; but all had on splendid dresses of red or blue, while wreaths of flowers rested on their hair  It was the first time that the youth had been present on such an occasion, and he stood silently aside watching the graceful dances and the pretty games played by the young people  And as he watched, he noticed one girl, dressed in white with scarlet pomegranates in her hair, who seemed to him lovelier than all the rest  When the feast was over, and the young man returned home, his manner was so strange that it drew the attention of all his friends', " Through his work next day the youth continued to see the girl's face, throwing the ball to her companions, or threading her way between them as she danced", ' At night sleep fled from him, and after tossing for hours on his bed, he would get up and plunge into a deep pool that lay a little way in the forest  This state of things went on for some weeks, then at last chance favoured him  One evening, as he was passing near the house where she lived, he saw her standing with her back to the wall, trying to beat off with her fan the attacks of a savage dog that was leaping at her throat  Alonzo, for such was his name, sprang forward, and with one blow of his fist stretched the creature dead upon the road  He then helped the frightened and half-fainting girl into the large cool verandah where her parents were sitting, and from that hour he was a welcome guest in the house, and it was not long before he was the promised husband of Julia  Every day, when his work was done, he used to go up to the house, half hidden among flowering plants and brilliant creepers, where humming-birds darted from bush to bush, and parrots of all colours, red and green and grey, shrieked in chorus  There he would find the maiden waiting for him, and they would spend an hour or two under the stars, which looked so large and bright that you felt as if you could almost touch them', " 'What did you do last night after you went home?' suddenly asked the girl one evening", " 'Just the same as I always do,' answered he", " 'It was too hot to sleep, so it was no use going to bed, and I walked straight of to the forest and bathed in one of those deep dark pools at the edge of the river", ' I have been there constantly for several months, but last night a strange thing happened  I was taking my last plunge, when I heard--sometimes from one side, and sometimes from another--the sound of a voice singing more sweetly than any nightingale, though I could not catch any words  I left the pool, and, dressing myself as fast as I could, I searched every bush and tree round the water, as I fancied that perhaps it was my friend who was playing a trick on me, but there was not a creature to be seen; and when I reached home I found my friend fast asleep', "' As Julia listened her face grew deadly white, and her whole body shivered as if with cold", ' From her childhood she had heard stories of the terrible beings that lived in the forests and were hidden under the banks of the rivers, and could only be kept off by powerful charms  Could the voice which had bewitched Alonzo have come from one of these? Perhaps, who knows, it might be the voice of the dreaded Yara herself, who sought young men on the eve of their marriage as her prey', " For a moment the girl sat choked with fear, as these thoughts rushed through her; then she said: 'Alonzo, will you promise something?' 'What is that?' asked he", " 'It is something that has to do with our future happiness", "' 'Oh! it is serious, then? Well, of course I promise", " Now tell me!' 'I want you to promise,' she answered, lowering her voice to a whisper, 'never to bathe in those pools again", "' 'But why not, queen of my soul; have I not gone there always, and nothing has harmed me, flower of my heart?' 'No; but perhaps something will", ' If you will not promise I shall go mad with fright It was near the end of January, and a terrible fall of snow was pelting down, and whirling through the streets and lanes; the windows were plastered with snow on the outside, snow fell in masses from the roofs', " Every one seemed in a great hurry; they ran, they flew, fell into each other's arms, holding fast for a moment as long as they could stand safely", ' Coaches and horses looked as if they had been frosted with sugar  The footmen stood with their backs against the carriages, so as to turn their faces from the wind  The foot passengers kept within the shelter of the carriages, which could only move slowly on in the deep snow  At last the storm abated, and a narrow path was swept clean in front of the houses; when two persons met in this path they stood still, for neither liked to take the first step on one side into the deep snow to let the other pass him  There they stood silent and motionless, till at last, as if by tacit consent, they each sacrificed a leg and buried it in the deep snow  Towards evening, the weather became calm  The sky, cleared from the snow, looked more lofty and transparent, while the stars shone with new brightness and purity  The frozen snow crackled under foot, and was quite firm enough to bear the sparrows, who hopped upon it in the morning dawn  They searched for food in the path which had been swept, but there was very little for them, and they were terribly cold  "Tweet, tweet," said one to another; "they call this a new year, but I think it is worse than the last', " We might just as well have kept the old year; I'm quite unhappy, and I have a right to be so", '" "Yes, you have; and yet the people ran about and fired off guns, to usher in the new year," said a little shivering sparrow  "They threw things against the doors, and were quite beside themselves with joy, because the old year had disappeared  I was glad too, for I expected we should have some warm days, but my hopes have come to nothing  It freezes harder than ever; I think mankind have made a mistake in reckoning time " "That they have," said a third, an old sparrow with a white poll; "they have something they call a calendar; it\'s an invention of their own, and everything must be arranged according to it, but it won\'t do  When spring comes, then the year begins  It is the voice of nature, and I reckon by that " "But when will spring come?" asked the others  "It will come when the stork returns, but he is very uncertain, and here in the town no one knows anything about it  In the country they have more knowledge; shall we fly away there and wait? we shall be nearer to spring then, certainly " "That may be all very well," said another sparrow, who had been hopping about for a long time, chirping, but not saying anything of consequence, "but I have found a few comforts here in town which, I\'m afraid, I should miss out in the country  Here in this neighborhood, there lives a family of people who have been so sensible as to place three or four flower-pots against the wall in the court-yard, so that the openings are all turned inward, and the bottom of each points outward  In the latter a hole has been cut large enough for me to fly in and out  I and my husband have built a nest in one of these pots, and all our young ones, who have now flown away, were brought up there  The people who live there of course made the whole arrangement that they might have the pleasure of seeing us, or they would not have done it  It pleased them also to strew bread-crumbs for us, and so we have food, and may consider ourselves provided for  So I think my husband and I will stay where we are; although we are not very happy, but we shall stay  You must know, sire, that my father was Mahmoud, the king of this country, the Black Isles, so called from the four little mountains which were once islands, while the capital was the place where now the great lake lies  My story will tell you how these changes came about  My father died when he was sixty-six, and I succeeded him  I married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, and I thought she loved me too  But one afternoon, when I was half asleep, and was being fanned by two of her maids, I heard one say to the other, "What a pity it is that our mistress no longer loves our master! I believe she would like to kill him if she could, for she is an enchantress " I soon found by watching that they were right, and when I mortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime, she begged that she might build a palace in the garden, where she wept and bewailed him for two years  At last I begged her to cease grieving for him, for although he could not speak or move, by her enchantments she just kept him alive  She turned upon me in a rage, and said over me some magic words, and I instantly became as you see me now, half man and half marble  Then this wicked enchantress changed the capital, which was a very populous and flourishing city, into the lake and desert plain you saw  The fish of four colours which are in it are the different races who lived in the town; the four hills are the four islands which give the name to my kingdom  All this the enchantress told me to add to my troubles  And this is not all  Every day she comes and beats me with a whip of buffalo hide  When the young king had finished his sad story he burst once more into tears, and the Sultan was much moved  "Tell me," he cried, "where is this wicked woman, and where is the miserable object of her affection, whom she just manages to keep alive?" "Where she lives I do not know," answered the unhappy prince, "but she goes every day at sunrise to see if the slave can yet speak to her, after she has beaten me " "Unfortunate king," said the Sultan, "I will do what I can to avenge you " So he consulted with the young king over the best way to bring this about, and they agreed their plan should be put in effect the next day  The Sultan then rested, and the young king gave himself up to happy hopes of release  The next day the Sultan arose, and then went to the palace in the garden where the black slave was  He drew his sword and destroyed the little life that remained in him, and then threw the body down a well  He then lay down on the couch where the slave had been, and waited for the enchantress  She went first to the young king, whom she beat with a hundred blows  Then she came to the room where she thought her wounded slave was, but where the Sultan really lay  She came near his couch and said, "Are you better to-day, my dear slave? Speak but one word to me " "How can I be better," answered the Sultan, imitating the language of the Ethiopians, "when I can never sleep for the cries and groans of your husband?" "What joy to hear you speak!" answered the queen  "Do you wish him to regain his proper shape?" "Yes," said the Sultan; "hasten to set him at liberty, so that I may no longer hear his cries " The queen at once went out and took a cup of water, and said over it some words that made it boil as if it were on the fire  Then she threw it over the prince, who at once regained his own form  He was filled with joy, but the enchantress said, "Hasten away from this place and never come back, lest I kill you " So he hid himself to see the end of the Sultan\'s plan' ,  " There once lived a merchant whose name was Mark, and whom people called 'Mark the Rich", "' He was a very hard-hearted man, for he could not bear poor people, and if he caught sight of a beggar anywhere near his house, he would order the servants to drive him away, or would set the dogs at him", " One day three very poor old men came begging to the door, and just as he was going to let the fierce dogs loose on them, his little daughter, Anastasia, crept close up to him and said: 'Dear daddy, let the poor old men sleep here to-night, do--to please me", "' Her father could not bear to refuse her, and the three beggars were allowed to sleep in a loft, and at night, when everyone in the house was fast asleep, little Anastasia got up, climbed up to the loft, and peeped in", ' The three old men stood in the middle of the loft, leaning on their sticks, with their long grey beards flowing down over their hands, and were talking together in low voices', " 'What news is there?' asked the eldest", " 'In the next village the peasant Ivan has just had his seventh son", " What shall we name him, and what fortune shall we give him?' said the second", " The third whispered, 'Call him Vassili, and give him all the property of the hard-hearted man in whose loft we stand, and who wanted to drive us from his door", "' After a little more talk the three made themselves ready and crept softly away", ' Anastasia, who had heard every word, ran straight to her father, and told him all  Mark was very much surprised; he thought, and thought, and in the morning he drove to the next village to try and find out if such a child really had been born  He went first to the priest, and asked him about the children in his parish', " 'Yesterday,' said the priest, 'a boy was born in the poorest house in the village", ' I named the unlucky little thing "Vassili " He is the seventh son, and the eldest is only seven years old, and they hardly have a mouthful amongst them all', " Who can be got to stand godfather to such a little beggar boy?' The merchant's heart beat fast, and his mind was full of bad thoughts about that poor little baby", ' He would be godfather himself, he said, and he ordered a fine christening feast; so the child was brought and christened, and Mark was very friendly to its father', " After the ceremony was over he took Ivan aside and said: 'Look here, my friend, you are a poor man", " How can you afford to bring up the boy? Give him to me and I'll make something of him, and I'll give you a present of a thousand crowns", " Is that a bargain?' Ivan scratched his head, and thought, and thought, and then he agreed", ' Mark counted out the money, wrapped the baby up in a fox skin, laid it in the sledge beside him, and drove back towards home', " When he had driven some miles he drew up, carried the child to the edge of a steep precipice and threw it over, muttering, 'There, now try to take my property!' Very soon after this some foreign merchants travelled along that same road on the way to see Mark and to pay the twelve thousand crowns which they owed him", ' As they were passing near the precipice they heard a sound of crying, and on looking over they saw a little green meadow wedged in between two great heaps of snow, and on the meadow lay a baby amongst the flowers  The merchants picked up the child, wrapped it up carefully, and drove on  When they saw Mark they told him what a strange thing they had found', " Mark guessed at once that the child must be his godson, asked to see him, and said: 'That's a nice little fellow; I should like to keep him", ' If you will make him over to me, I will let you off your debt', "' The merchants were very pleased to make so good a bargain, left the child with Mark, and drove off", ' At night Mark took the child, put it in a barrel, fastened the lid tight down, and threw it into the sea  Once upon a time there reigned over Persia a Sultan named Kosrouschah, who from his boyhood had been fond of putting on a disguise and seeking adventures in all parts of the city, accompanied by one of his officers, disguised like himself  And no sooner was his father buried and the ceremonies over that marked his accession to the throne, than the young man hastened to throw off his robes of state, and calling to his vizir to make ready likewise, stole out in the simple dress of a private citizen into the less known streets of the capital', " Passing down a lonely street, the Sultan heard women's voices in loud discussion; and peeping through a crack in the door, he saw three sisters, sitting on a sofa in a large hall, talking in a very lively and earnest manner", ' Judging from the few words that reached his ear, they were each explaining what sort of men they wished to marry  "I ask nothing better," cried the eldest, "than to have the Sultan\'s baker for a husband  Think of being able to eat as much as one wanted, of that delicious bread that is baked for his Highness alone! Let us see if your wish is as good as mine " "I," replied the second sister, "should be quite content with the Sultan\'s head cook', " What delicate stews I should feast upon! And, as I am persuaded that the Sultan's bread is used all through the palace, I should have that into the bargain", ' You see, my dear sister, my taste is as good as yours " It was now the turn of the youngest sister, who was by far the most beautiful of the three, and had, besides, more sense than the other two  "As for me," she said, "I should take a higher flight; and if we are to wish for husbands, nothing less than the Sultan himself will do for me " The Sultan was so much amused by the conversation he had overheard, that he made up his mind to gratify their wishes, and turning to the grand-vizir, he bade him note the house, and on the following morning to bring the ladies into his presence  The grand-vizir fulfilled his commission, and hardly giving them time to change their dresses, desired the three sisters to follow him to the palace  Here they were presented one by one, and when they had bowed before the Sultan, the sovereign abruptly put the question to them: "Tell me, do you remember what you wished for last night, when you were making merry? Fear nothing, but answer me the truth " These words, which were so unexpected, threw the sisters into great confusion, their eyes fell, and the blushes of the youngest did not fail to make an impression on the heart of the Sultan  All three remained silent, and he hastened to continue: "Do not be afraid, I have not the slightest intention of giving you pain, and let me tell you at once, that I know the wishes formed by each one  You," he said, turning to the youngest, "who desired to have me for an husband, shall be satisfied this very day  And you," he added, addressing himself to the other two, "shall be married at the same moment to my baker and to my chief cook " When the Sultan had finished speaking the three sisters flung themselves at his feet, and the youngest faltered out, "Oh, sire, since you know my foolish words, believe, I pray you, that they were only said in joke  I am unworthy of the honour you propose to do me, and I can only ask pardon for my boldness " The other sisters also tried to excuse themselves, but the Sultan would hear nothing  "No, no," he said, "my mind is made up  Your wishes shall be accomplished " So the three weddings were celebrated that same day, but with a great difference', " That of the youngest was marked by all the magnificence that was customary at the marriage of the Shah of Persia, while the festivities attending the nuptials of the Sultan's baker and his chief cook were only such as were suitable to their conditions", ' This, though quite natural, was highly displeasing to the elder sisters, who fell into a passion of jealousy, which in the end caused a great deal of trouble and pain to several people  And the first time that they had the opportunity of speaking to each other, which was not till several days later at a public bath, they did not attempt to disguise their feelings  "Can you possibly understand what the Sultan saw in that little cat," said one to the other, "for him to be so fascinated by her?" "He must be quite blind," returned the wife of the chief cook  "As for her looking a little younger than we do, what does that matter? You would have made a far better Sultana than she " "Oh, I say nothing of myself," replied the elder, "and if the Sultan had chosen you it would have been all very well; but it really grieves me that he should have selected a wretched little creature like that  Long, long ago in the province of Tango there lived on the shore of Japan in the little fishing village of Mizu-no-ye a young fisherman named Urashima Taro  His father had been a fisherman before him, and his skill had more than doubly descended to his son, for Urashima was the most skillful fisher in all that country side, and could catch more Bonito and Tai in a day than his comrades could in a week  But in the little fishing village, more than for being a clever fisher of the sea was he known for his kind heart  In his whole life he had never hurt anything, either great or small, and when a boy, his companions had always laughed at him, for he would never join with them in teasing animals, but always tried to keep them from this cruel sport', " One soft summer twilight he was going home at the end of a day's fishing when he came upon a group of children", ' They were all screaming and talking at the tops of their voices, and seemed to be in a state of great excitement about something, and on his going up to them to see what was the matter he saw that they were tormenting a tortoise  First one boy pulled it this way, then another boy pulled it that way, while a third child beat it with a stick, and the fourth hammered its shell with a stone  Now Urashima felt very sorry for the poor tortoise and made up his mind to rescue it  He spoke to the boys: "Look here, boys, you are treating that poor tortoise so badly that it will soon die!" The boys, who were all of an age when children seem to delight in being cruel to animals, took no notice of Urashima\'s gentle reproof, but went on teasing it as before  One of the older boys answered: "Who cares whether it lives or dies? We do not  Here, boys, go on, go on!" And they began to treat the poor tortoise more cruelly than ever  Urashima waited a moment, turning over in his mind what would be the best way to deal with the boys  He would try to persuade them to give the tortoise up to him, so he smiled at them and said: "I am sure you are all good, kind boys! Now won\'t you give me the tortoise? I should like to have it so much!" "No, we won\'t give you the tortoise," said one of the boys  "Why should we? We caught it ourselves " "What you say is true," said Urashima, "but I do not ask you to give it to me for nothing  I will give you some money for it--in other words, the Ojisan (Uncle) will buy it of you  Won\'t that do for you, my boys?" He held up the money to them, strung on a piece of string through a hole in the center of each coin  "Look, boys, you can buy anything you like with this money  You can do much more with this money than you can with that poor tortoise  See what good boys you are to listen to me " The boys were not bad boys at all, they were only mischievous, and as Urashima spoke they were won by his kind smile and gentle words and began "to be of his spirit," as they say in Japan  Gradually they all came up to him, the ringleader of the little band holding out the tortoise to him  "Very well, Ojisan, we will give you the tortoise if you will give us the money!" And Urashima took the tortoise and gave the money to the boys, who, calling to each other, scampered away and were soon out of sight  Then Urashima stroked the tortoise\'s back, saying as he did so: "Oh, you poor thing! Poor thing!--there, there! you are safe now! They say that a stork lives for a thousand years, but the tortoise for ten thousand years  You have the longest life of any creature in this world, and you were in great danger of having that precious life cut short by those cruel boys  Luckily I was passing by and saved you, and so life is still yours  Now I am going to take you back to your home, the sea, at once  Do not let yourself be caught again, for there might be no one to save you next time!" All the time that the kind fisherman was speaking he was walking quickly to the shore and out upon the rocks; then putting the tortoise into the water he watched the animal disappear, and turned homewards himself, for he was tired and the sun had set  The next morning Urashima went out as usual in his boat  The weather was fine and the sea and sky were both blue and soft in the tender haze of the summer morning  Once upon a time there lived a king who was so fond of wine that he could not go to sleep unless he knew he had a great flaskful tied to his bed-post  All day long he drank till he was too stupid to attend to his business, and everything in the kingdom went to rack and ruin  But one day an accident happened to him, and he was struck on the head by a falling bough, so that he fell from his horse and lay dead upon the ground  His wife and son mourned his loss bitterly, for, in spite of his faults, he had always been kind to them  So they abandoned the crown and forsook their country, not knowing or caring where they went  At length they wandered into a forest, and being very tired, sat down under a tree to eat some bread that they had brought with them', " When they had finished the queen said: 'My son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water", "' The prince got up at once and went to a brook which he heard gurgling near at hand", ' He stooped and filled his hat with the water, which he brought to his mother; then he turned and followed the stream up to its source in a rock, where it bubbled out clear and fresh and cold  He knelt down to take a draught from the deep pool below the rock, when he saw the reflection of a sword hanging from the branch of a tree over his head  The young man drew back with a start; but in a moment he climbed the tree, cutting the rope which held the sword, and carried the weapon to his mother  The queen was greatly surprised at the sight of anything so splendid in such a lonely place, and took it in her hands to examine it closely', " It was of curious workmanship, wrought with gold, and on its handle was written: 'The man who can buckle on this sword will become stronger than other men", "' The queen's heart swelled with joy as she read these words, and she bade her son lose no time in testing their truth", ' So he fastened it round his waist, and instantly a glow of strength seemed to run through his veins  He took hold of a thick oak tree and rooted it up as easily as if it had been a weed  This discovery put new life into the queen and her son, and they continued their walk through the forest  But night was drawing on, and the darkness grew so thick that it seemed as if it could be cut with a knife  They did not want to sleep in the wood, for they were afraid of wolves and other wild beasts, so they groped their way along, hand in hand, till the prince tripped over something which lay across the path  He could not see what it was, but stooped down and tried to lift it  The thing was very heavy, and he thought his back would break under the strain  At last with a great heave he moved it out of the road, and as it fell he knew it was a huge rock  Behind the rock was a cave which it was quite clear was the home of some robbers, though not one of the band was there  Hastily putting out the fire which burned brightly at the back, and bidding his mother come in and keep very still, the prince began to pace up and down, listening for the return of the robbers  But he was very sleepy, and in spite of all his efforts he felt he could not keep awake much longer, when he heard the sound of the robbers returning, shouting and singing as they marched along  Soon the singing ceased, and straining his ears he heard them discussing anxiously what had become of their cave, and why they could not see the fire as usual', " 'This must be the place,' said a voice, which the prince took to be that of the captain", " 'Yes, I feel the ditch before the entrance", ' Someone forgot to pile up the fire before we left and it has burnt itself out! But it is all right  Let every man jump across, and as he does so cry out "Hop! I am here' ,  "The king's harper, who always formed a part of his escort, was chanting a ballad which he made as he went on playing on his instrument--about the princess and the goblins, and the prowess of Curdie, when all at once he ceased, with his eyes on one of the doors of the hall", ' Thereupon the eyes of the king and his guests turned thitherward also  The next moment, through the open doorway came the princess Irene  She went straight up to her father, with her right hand stretched out a little sideways, and her forefinger, as her father and Curdie understood, feeling its way along the invisible thread', " The king took her on his knee, and she said in his ear: 'King-papa, do you hear that noise?' 'I hear nothing,' said the king", " 'Listen,' she said, holding up her forefinger", ' The king listened, and a great stillness fell upon the company  Each man, seeing that the king listened, listened also, and the harper sat with his harp between his arms, and his finger silent upon the strings', " 'I do hear a noise,' said the king at length--'a noise as of distant thunder", ' It is coming nearer and nearer', " What can it be?' They all heard it now, and each seemed ready to start to his feet as he listened", ' Yet all sat perfectly still  The noise came rapidly nearer', " 'What can it be?' said the king again", " 'I think it must be another storm coming over the mountain,' said Sir Walter", " Then Curdie, who at the first word of the king had slipped from his seat, and laid his ear to the ground, rose up quickly, and approaching the king said, speaking very fast: 'Please, Your Majesty, I think I know what it is", ' I have no time to explain, for that might make it too late for some of us', " Will Your Majesty give orders that everybody leave the house as quickly as possible and get up the mountain?' The king, who was the wisest man in the kingdom, knew well there was a time when things must be done and questions left till afterwards", ' He had faith in Curdie, and rose instantly, with Irene in his arms', " 'Every man and woman follow me,' he said, and strode out into the darkness", ' Before he had reached the gate, the noise had grown to a great thundering roar, and the ground trembled beneath their feet, and before the last of them had crossed the court, out after them from the great hall door came a huge rush of turbid water, and almost swept them away  But they got safe out of the gate and up the mountain, while the torrent went roaring down the road into the valley beneath  Curdie had left the king and the princess to look after his mother, whom he and his father, one on each side, caught up when the stream overtook them and carried safe and dry  When the king had got out of the way of the water, a little up the mountain, he stood with the princess in his arms, looking back with amazement on the issuing torrent, which glimmered fierce and foamy through the night  There Curdie rejoined them', " 'Now, Curdie,' said the king, 'what does it mean? Is this what you expected?' 'It is, Your Majesty,' said Curdie; and proceeded to tell him about the second scheme of the goblins, who, fancying the miners of more importance to the upper world than they were, had resolved, if they should fail in carrying off the king's daughter, to flood the mine and drown the miners", ' Then he explained what the miners had done to prevent it  The goblins had, in pursuance of their design, let loose all the underground reservoirs and streams, expecting the water to run down into the mine, which was lower than their part of the mountain, for they had, as they supposed, not knowing of the solid wall close behind, broken a passage through into it', " But the readiest outlet the water could find had turned out to be the tunnel they had made to the king's house, the possibility of which catastrophe had not occurred to the young miner until he had laid his ear to the floor of the hall", ' What was then to be done? The house appeared in danger of falling, and every moment the torrent was increasing It is autumn  We stand on the ramparts, and look out over the sea  We look at the numerous ships, and at the Swedish coast on the opposite side of the sound, rising far above the surface of the waters which mirror the glow of the evening sky  Behind us the wood is sharply defined; mighty trees surround us, and the yellow leaves flutter down from the branches  Below, at the foot of the wall, stands a gloomy looking building enclosed in palisades  The space between is dark and narrow, but still more dismal must it be behind the iron gratings in the wall which cover the narrow loopholes or windows, for in these dungeons the most depraved of the criminals are confined', " A ray of the setting sun shoots into the bare cells of one of the captives, for God's sun shines upon the evil and the good", ' The hardened criminal casts an impatient look at the bright ray  Then a little bird flies towards the grating, for birds twitter to the just as well as to the unjust  He only cries, "Tweet, tweet," and then perches himself near the grating, flutters his wings, pecks a feather from one of them, puffs himself out, and sets his feathers on end round his breast and throat  The bad, chained man looks at him, and a more gentle expression comes into his hard face  In his breast there rises a thought which he himself cannot rightly analyze, but the thought has some connection with the sunbeam, with the bird, and with the scent of violets, which grow luxuriantly in spring at the foot of the wall', " Then there comes the sound of the hunter's horn, merry and full", ' The little bird starts, and flies away, the sunbeam gradually vanishes, and again there is darkness in the room and in the heart of that bad man  Still the sun has shone into that heart, and the twittering of the bird has touched it', " Sound on, ye glorious strains of the hunter's horn; continue your stirring tones, for the evening is mild, and the surface of the sea, heaving slowly and calmly, is smooth as a mirror", '    ' ,  " Between the Baltic and the North Sea there lies an old swan's nest, wherein swans are born and have been born that shall never die", ' In olden times a flock of swans flew over the Alps to the green plains around Milan, where it was delightful to dwell  This flight of swans men called the Lombards', " Another flock, with shining plumage and honest eyes, soared southward to Byzantium; the swans established themselves there close by the Emperor's throne, and spread their wings over him as shields to protect him", ' They received the name of Varangians  On the coast of France there sounded a cry of fear, for the blood-stained swans that came from the North with fire under their wings; and the people prayed, "Heaven deliver us from the wild Northmen " On the fresh sward of England stood the Danish swan by the open seashore, with the crown of three kingdoms on his head; and he stretched out his golden sceptre over the land  The heathens on the Pomerian coast bent the knee, and the Danish swans came with the banner of the Cross and with the drawn sword  "That was in the very old times," you say  In later days two mighty swans have been seen to fly from the nest  A light shone far through the air, far over the lands of the earth; the swan, with the strong beating of his wings, scattered the twilight mists, and the starry sky was seen, and it was as if it came nearer to the earth  That was the swan Tycho Brahe  "Yes, then," you say; "but in our own days?" We have seen swan after swan soar by in glorious flight  One let his pinions glide over the strings of the golden harp, and it resounded through the North', " Norway's mountains seemed to rise higher in the sunlight of former days; there was a rustling among the pine trees and the birches; the gods of the North, the heroes, and the noble women, showed themselves in the dark forest depths", ' We have seen a swan beat with his wings upon the marble crag, so that it burst, and the forms of beauty imprisoned in the stone stepped out to the sunny day, and men in the lands round about lifted up their heads to behold these mighty forms  We have seen a third swan spinning the thread of thought that is fastened from country to country round the world, so that the word may fly with lightning speed from land to land', " And our Lord loves the old swan's nest between the Baltic and the North Sea", ' And when the mighty birds come soaring through the air to destroy it, even the callow young stand round in a circle on the margin of the nest, and though their breasts may be struck so that their blood flows, they bear it, and strike with their wings and their claws  Centuries will pass by, swans will fly forth from the nest, men will see them and hear them in the world, before it shall be said in spirit and in truth, "This is the last swan--the last song from the swan\'s nest "     There was once a poor Prince  He possessed a kingdom which, though small, was yet large enough for him to marry on, and married he wished to be', " Now it was certainly a little audacious of him to venture to say to the Emperor's daughter, 'Will you marry me?' But he did venture to say so, for his name was known far and wide", " There were hundreds of princesses who would gladly have said 'Yes,' but would she say the same? Well, we shall see", " On the grave of the Prince's father grew a rose-tree, a very beautiful rose-tree", ' It only bloomed every five years, and then bore but a single rose, but oh, such a rose! Its scent was so sweet that when you smelt it you forgot all your cares and troubles  And he had also a nightingale which could sing as if all the beautiful melodies in the world were shut up in its little throat  This rose and this nightingale the Princess was to have, and so they were both put into silver caskets and sent to her', " The Emperor had them brought to him in the great hall, where the Princess was playing 'Here comes a duke a-riding' with her ladies-in-waiting", ' And when she caught sight of the big caskets which contained the presents, she clapped her hands for joy', " 'If only it were a little pussy cat!' she said", ' But the rose-tree with the beautiful rose came out', " 'But how prettily it is made!' said all the ladies-in-waiting", " 'It is more than pretty,' said the Emperor, 'it is charming!' But the Princess felt it, and then she almost began to cry", " 'Ugh! Papa,' she said, 'it is not artificial, it is REAL!' 'Ugh!' said all the ladies-in-waiting, 'it is real!' 'Let us see first what is in the other casket before we begin to be angry,' thought the Emperor, and there came out the nightingale", ' It sang so beautifully that one could scarcely utter a cross word against it', " 'Superbe! charmant!' said the ladies-in-waiting, for they all chattered French, each one worse than the other", " 'How much the bird reminds me of the musical snuff-box of the late Empress!' said an old courtier", " 'Ah, yes, it is the same tone, the same execution!' 'Yes,' said the Emperor; and then he wept like a little child", " 'I hope that this, at least, is not real?' asked the Princess", " 'Yes, it is a real bird,' said those who had brought it", " 'Then let the bird fly away,' said the Princess; and she would not on any account allow the Prince to come", " 'But he was nothing daunted", ' He painted his face brown and black, drew his cap well over his face, and knocked at the door', " 'Good-day, Emperor,' he said", " 'Can I get a place here as servant in the castle?' 'Yes,' said the Emperor, 'but there are so many who ask for a place that I don't know whether there will be one for you; but, still, I will think of you", ' Stay, it has just occurred to me that I want someone to look after the swine, for I have so very many of them', "' And the Prince got the situation of Imperial Swineherd", ' He had a wretched little room close to the pigsties; here he had to stay, but the whole day he sat working, and when evening was come he had made a pretty little pot', " All round it were little bells, and when the pot boiled they jingled most beautifully and played the old tune--      'Where is Augustus dear?      Alas! he's not here, here, here!' But the most wonderful thing was, that when one held one's finger in the steam of the pot, then at once one could smell what dinner was ready in any fire-place in the town" ,  'There were formerly a man and a woman living in the parish of Llanlavan, in the place which is called Hwrdh  And work became scarce, so the man said to his wife, "I will go search for work, and you may live here " So he took fair leave, and travelled far toward the East, and at last came to the house of a farmer and asked for work  "What work can ye do?" said the farmer  "I can do all kinds of work," said Ivan', " Then they agreed upon three pounds for the year's wages", ' When the end of the year came his master showed him the three pounds  "See, Ivan," said he, "here\'s your wage; but if you will give it me back I\'ll give you a piece of advice instead " "Give me my wage," said Ivan  "No, I\'ll not," said the master; "I\'ll explain my advice " "Tell it me, then," said Ivan  Then said the master, "Never leave the old road for the sake of a new one " After that they agreed for another year at the old wages, and at the end of it Ivan took instead a piece of advice, and this was it: "Never lodge where an old man is married to a young woman " The same thing happened at the end of the third year, when the piece of advice was: "Honesty is the best policy " But Ivan would not stay longer, but wanted to go back to his wife  "Don\'t go to-day," said his master; "my wife bakes to-morrow, and she shall make thee a cake to take home to thy good woman " And when Ivan was going to leave, "Here," said his master, "here is a cake for thee to take home to thy wife, and, when ye are most joyous together, then break the cake, and not sooner " So he took fair leave of them and travelled towards home, and at last he came to Wayn Her, and there he met three merchants from Tre Rhyn, of his own parish, coming home from Exeter Fair  "Oho! Ivan," said they, "come with us; glad are we to see you  Where have you been so long?" "I have been in service," said Ivan, "and now I\'m going home to my wife " "Oh, come with us! you\'ll be right welcome " But when they took the new road Ivan kept to the old one  And robbers fell upon them before they had gone far from Ivan as they were going by the fields of the houses in the meadow  They began to cry out, "Thieves!" and Ivan shouted out "Thieves!" too', " And when the robbers heard Ivan's shout they ran away, and the merchants went by the new road and Ivan by the old one till they met again at Market-Jew", ' "Oh, Ivan," said the merchants, "we are beholding to you; but for you we would have been lost men  Come lodge with us at our cost, and welcome " When they came to the place where they used to lodge, Ivan said, "I must see the host " "The host," they cried; "what do you want with the host? Here is the hostess, and she\'s young and pretty', " If you want to see the host you'll find him in the kitchen" ,  ' There was once an old peasant, and he must have had more brains under his hair than ever I had, for he was a merchant, and used to take things every year to sell at the big fair of Nijni Novgorod  Well, I could never do that  I could never be anything better than an old forester  "Never mind, grandfather," said Maroosia  God knows best, and He makes some merchants and some foresters, and some good and some bad, all in His own way  Anyhow this one was a merchant, and he had three daughters  They were none of them so bad to look at, but one of them was as pretty as Maroosia  And she was the best of them too  The others put all the hard work on her, while they did nothing but look at themselves in the looking-glass and complain of what they had to eat  They called the pretty one "Little Stupid," because she was so good and did all their work for them  Oh, they were real bad ones, those two', " We wouldn't have them in here for a minute", ' Well, the time came round for the merchant to pack up and go to the big fair  He called his daughters, and said, "Little pigeons," just as I say to you  "Little pigeons," says he, "what would you like me to bring you from the fair?" Says the eldest, "I\'d like a necklace, but it must be a rich one " Says the second, "I want a new dress with gold hems " But the youngest, the good one, Little Stupid, said nothing at all  "Now little one," says her father, "what is it you want? I must bring something for you too " Says the little one, "Could I have a silver saucer and a transparent apple? But never mind if there are none " The old merchant says, "Long hair, short sense," just as I say to Maroosia; but he promised the little pretty one, who was so good that her sisters called her stupid, that if he could get her a silver saucer and a transparent apple she should have them', " Then they all kissed each other, and he cracked his whip, and off he went, with the little bells jingling on the horses' harness", ' The three sisters waited till he came back  The two elder ones looked in the looking-glass, and thought how fine they would look in the new necklace and the new dress; but the little pretty one took care of her old mother, and scrubbed and dusted and swept and cooked, and every day the other two said that the soup was burnt or the bread not properly baked', " Then one day there were a jingling of bells and a clattering of horses' hoofs, and the old merchant came driving back from the fair", ' The sisters ran out  "Where is the necklace?" asked the first  "You haven\'t forgotten the dress?" asked the second  But the little one, Little Stupid, helped her old father off with his coat, and asked him if he was tired  "Well, little one," says the old merchant, "and don\'t you want your fairing too? I went from one end of the market to the other before I could get what you wanted  I bought the silver saucer from an old Jew, and the transparent apple from a Finnish hag' ,  " The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became the king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual", ' Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no opportunity for a word  And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing so  At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a tortoise  Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made friends with him  And one day, when they had become very intimate with him, they said to the tortoise: "Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot  Will you come there with us?" "But how can I get there?" "We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say nothing to anybody " "Oh! that I can do  Take me with you " "That\'s right," said they  And making the tortoise bite hold of a stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up into the air  Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, "Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!" Whereupon the tortoise wanted to say, "If my friends choose to carry me, what is that to you, you wretched slaves!" So just as the swift flight of the wild ducks had brought him over the king\'s palace in the city of Benares, he let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open courtyard, split in two! And there arose a universal cry, "A tortoise has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in two!" The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat, "Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?" The future Buddha thought to himself, "Long expecting, wishing to admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so  This tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must have made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air to take him to the hills  But he, being unable to hold his tongue when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted to say something, and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and thus lost his life " And saying, "Truly, O king! those who are called chatter-boxes--people whose words have no end--come to grief like this," he uttered these Verses:   "Verily the tortoise killed himself   Whilst uttering his voice;   Though he was holding tight the stick,   By a word himself he slew    "Behold him then, O excellent by strength!   And speak wise words, not out of season    You see how, by his talking overmuch,   The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!" The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, "O Teacher! are you speaking of us?" And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, "O great king! be it thou, or be it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap like this " And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few words     There is an old tale told in Erin of a lovable and bright and handsome youth named Donn-bo, who was the best singer of "Songs of Idleness" and the best teller of "King Stories" in the world  He could tell a tale of each king who reigned in Erin, from the "Tale of the Destruction of Dind Righ," when Cova Coelbre was killed, down to the kings who reigned in his own time  On a night before a battle, the warriors said, "Make minstrelsy to-night for us, Donn-bo " But Donn-bo answered, "No word at all will come on my lips to-night; therefore, for this night let the King-buffoon of Ireland amuse you  But to-morrow, at this hour, in whatsoever place they and I shall be, I will make minstrelsy for the fighting men " For the warriors had said that unless Donn-bo would go with them on that hosting, not one of them would go  The battle was past, and on the evening of the morrow at that same hour Donn-bo lay dead, his fair young body stretched across the body of the King of Ireland, for he had died in defending his chief  But his head had rolled away among a wisp of growing rushes by the waterside  At the feasting of the army on that night a warrior said, "Where is Donn-bo, that he may make minstrelsy for us, as he promised us at this hour yesternight, and that he may tell us the \'King Stories of Erin\'?" A valiant champion of the men of Munster answered, "I will go over the battle-field and seek for him " He enquired among the living for Donn-bo, but he found him not, and then he searched hither and thither among the dead  At last he came where the body of the King of Erin lay, and a young, fair corpse beside it  In all the air about there was the sound of minstrelsy, low and very sweet; dead bards and poets reciting in faint whispers old tales and poems to dead chiefs  The wild, clear note of the battle-march, the _dord fiansa_, played by the drooping hands of slain warriors upon the points of broken spears, low like the echo of an echo, sounded in the clump of rushes hard by; and, above them all, a voice, faint and very still, that sang a song that was sweeter than the tunes of the whole world beside  The voice that sang was the voice of the head of Donn-bo  The warrior stooped to pick up the head  "Do not touch me," said the head, "for we are commanded by the King of the Plains of Heaven to make music to-night for our lord, the King of Erin, the shining one who lies dead beside us; and though all of us are lying dead likewise, no faintness or feebleness shall prevent us from obeying that command  Disturb me not " "The hosts of Leinster are asking thee to make minstrelsy for them, as thou didst promise yesternight," said the messenger  "When my minstrelsy here is done, I will go with thee," saith the head; "but only if Christ, the Son of God, in whose presence I now am, go with me, and if thou takest me to my body again " "That shall be done, indeed," saith the messenger, and when it had ceased chanting for the King of Erin he carried away the head  When the messenger came again amongst the warriors they stopped their feasting and gathered round him  "Hast thou brought anything from the battle-field?" they cried  "I have brought the head of Donn-bo," said the man  "Set it upon a pillar that we may see and hear it," cried they all; and they said, "It is no luck for thee to be like that, Donn-bo, and thou the most beautiful minstrel and the best in Erin  Make music, for the love of Jesus Christ, the Son of God  Amuse the Leinster men to-night as thou didst amuse thy lord a while ago " Then Donn-bo turned his face to the wall, that the darkness might be around him, and he raised his melody in the quiet night; and the sound of that minstrelsy was so piteous and sad that the hosts sat weeping at the sound of it  Then was the head taken to his body, and the neck joined itself to the shoulders again, and Donn-bo was at rest  This is the story of the "Talking Head of Donn-bo "   Belonging to the lordly manor-house was beautiful, well-kept garden, with rare trees and flowers; the guests of the proprietor declared their admiration of it; the people of the neighborhood, from town and country, came on Sundays and holidays, and asked permission to see the garden; indeed, whole schools used to pay visits to it  Outside the garden, by the palings at the road-side, stood a great mighty Thistle, which spread out in many directions from the root, so that it might have been called a thistle bush', " Nobody looked at it, except the old Ass which drew the milk-maid's cart", ' This Ass used to stretch out his neck towards the Thistle, and say, "You are beautiful; I should like to eat you!" But his halter was not long enough to let him reach it and eat it  There was great company at the manor-house--some very noble people from the capital; young pretty girls, and among them a young lady who came from a long distance  She had come from Scotland, and was of high birth, and was rich in land and in gold--a bride worth winning, said more than one of the young gentlemen; and their lady mothers said the same thing', " The young people amused themselves on the lawn, and played at ball; they wandered among the flowers, and each of the young girls broke off a flower, and fastened it in a young gentleman's buttonhole", ' But the young Scotch lady looked round, for a long time, in an undecided way  None of the flowers seemed to suit her taste  Then her eye glanced across the paling--outside stood the great thistle bush, with the reddish-blue, sturdy flowers; she saw them, she smiled, and asked the son of the house to pluck one for her  "It is the flower of Scotland," she said  "It blooms in the scutcheon of my country  Give me yonder flower " And he brought the fairest blossom, and pricked his fingers as completely as if it had grown on the sharpest rose bush  She placed the thistle-flower in the buttonhole of the young man, and he felt himself highly honored  Each of the other young gentlemen would willingly have given his own beautiful flower to have worn this one, presented by the fair hand of the Scottish maiden  And if the son of the house felt himself honored, what were the feelings of the Thistle bush? It seemed to him as if dew and sunshine were streaming through him  "I am something more than I knew of," said the Thistle to itself  "I suppose my right place is really inside the palings, and not outside  One is often strangely placed in this world; but now I have at least managed to get one of my people within the pale, and indeed into a buttonhole!" The Thistle told this event to every blossom that unfolded itself, and not many days had gone by before the Thistle heard, not from men, not from the twittering of the birds, but from the air itself, which stores up the sounds, and carries them far around--out of the most retired walks of the garden, and out of the rooms of the house, in which doors and windows stood open, that the young gentleman who had received the thistle-flower from the hand of the fair Scottish maiden had also now received the heart and hand of the lady in question  They were a handsome pair--it was a good match  "That match I made up!" said the Thistle; and he thought of the flower he had given for the buttonhole  Every flower that opened heard of this occurrence  "I shall certainly be transplanted into the garden," thought the Thistle, "and perhaps put into a pot, which crowds one in  That is said to be the greatest of all honors " And the Thistle pictured this to himself in such a lively manner, that at last he said, with full conviction, "I am to be transplanted into a pot " Then he promised every little thistle flower which unfolded itself that it also should be put into a pot, and perhaps into a buttonhole, the highest honor that could be attained  But not one of them was put into a pot, much less into a buttonhole  They drank in the sunlight and the air; lived on the sunlight by day, and on the dew by night; bloomed--were visited by bees and hornets, who looked after the honey, the dowry of the flower, and they took the honey, and left the flower where it was  "The thievish rabble!" said the Thistle  An old story yet lives of the "Thorny Road of Honor," of a marksman, who indeed attained to rank and office, but only after a lifelong and weary strife against difficulties  Who has not, in reading this story, thought of his own strife, and of his own numerous "difficulties?" The story is very closely akin to reality; but still it has its harmonious explanation here on earth, while reality often points beyond the confines of life to the regions of eternity  The history of the world is like a magic lantern that displays to us, in light pictures upon the dark ground of the present, how the benefactors of mankind, the martyrs of genius, wandered along the thorny road of honor  From all periods, and from every country, these shining pictures display themselves to us  Each only appears for a few moments, but each represents a whole life, sometimes a whole age, with its conflicts and victories  Let us contemplate here and there one of the company of martyrs--the company which will receive new members until the world itself shall pass away  We look down upon a crowded amphitheatre  Out of the "Clouds" of Aristophanes, satire and humor are pouring down in streams upon the audience; on the stage Socrates, the most remarkable man in Athens, he who had been the shield and defence of the people against the thirty tyrants, is held up mentally and bodily to ridicule--Socrates, who saved Alcibiades and Xenophon in the turmoil of battle, and whose genius soared far above the gods of the ancients', " He himself is present; he has risen from the spectator's bench, and has stepped forward, that the laughing Athenians may well appreciate the likeness between himself and the caricature on the stage", ' There he stands before them, towering high above them all  Thou juicy, green, poisonous hemlock, throw thy shadow over Athens--not thou, olive tree of fame! Seven cities contended for the honor of giving birth to Homer--that is to say, they contended after his death! Let us look at him as he was in his lifetime  He wanders on foot through the cities, and recites his verses for a livelihood; the thought for the morrow turns his hair gray! He, the great seer, is blind, and painfully pursues his way--the sharp thorn tears the mantle of the king of poets  His song yet lives, and through that alone live all the heroes and gods of antiquity  One picture after another springs up from the east, from the west, far removed from each other in time and place, and yet each one forming a portion of the thorny road of honor, on which the thistle indeed displays a flower, but only to adorn the grave  The camels pass along under the palm trees; they are richly laden with indigo and other treasures of value, sent by the ruler of the land to him whose songs are the delight of the people, the fame of the country  He whom envy and falsehood have driven into exile has been found, and the caravan approaches the little town in which he has taken refuge  A poor corpse is carried out of the town gate, and the funeral procession causes the caravan to halt  The dead man is he whom they have been sent to seek--Firdusi--who has wandered the Thorny road of honor even to the end  The African, with blunt features, thick lips, and woolly hair, sits on the marble steps of the palace in the capital of Portugal, and begs  He is the submissive slave of Camoens, and but for him, and for the copper coins thrown to him by the passers-by, his master, the poet of the "Lusiad," would die of hunger  Now, a costly monument marks the grave of Camoens  There is a new picture  Behind the iron grating a man appears, pale as death, with long unkempt beard  "I have made a discovery," he says, "the greatest that has been made for centuries; and they have kept me locked up here for more than twenty years!" Who is the man? "A madman," replies the keeper of the madhouse  "What whimsical ideas these lunatics have! He imagines that one can propel things by means of steam " It is Solomon de Cares, the discoverer of the power of steam, whose theory, expressed in dark words, is not understood by Richelieu; and he dies in the madhouse  Here stands Columbus, whom the street boys used once to follow and jeer, because he wanted to discover a new world; and he has discovered it  Shouts of joy greet him from the breasts of all, and the clash of bells sounds to celebrate his triumphant return; but the clash of the bells of envy soon drowns the others  The discoverer of a world--he who lifted the American gold land from the sea, and gave it to his king--he is rewarded with iron chains', " He wishes that these chains may be placed in his coffin, for they witness to the world of the way in which a man's contemporaries reward good service" ,  ' There was once a man who had three sons, and no other possessions beyond the house in which he lived  Now the father loved his three sons equally, so that he could not make up his mind which of them should have the house after his death, because he did not wish to favour any one more than the others  And he did not want to sell the house, because it had belonged to his family for generations; otherwise he could have divided the money equally amongst them', " At last an idea struck him, and he said to his sons: 'You must all go out into the world, and look about you, and each learn a trade, and then, when you return, whoever can produce the best masterpiece shall have the house", "' The sons were quite satisfied", ' The eldest wished to be a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master  They appointed a time when they were to return home, and then they all set out  It so happened that each found a good master, where he learnt all that was necessary for his trade in the best possible way', " The blacksmith had to shoe the king's horses, and thought to himself, 'Without doubt the house will be yours!' The barber shaved the best men in the kingdom, and he, too, made sure that the house would be his", " The fencing-master received many a blow, but he set his teeth, and would not allow himself to be troubled by them, for he thought to himself, 'If you are afraid of a blow you will never get the house", "' When the appointed time had come the three brothers met once more, and they sat down and discussed the best opportunity of showing off their skill", ' Just then a hare came running across the field towards them', " 'Look!' said the barber, 'here comes something in the nick of time!' seized basin and soap, made a lather whilst the hare was approaching, and then, as it ran at full tilt, shaved its moustaches, without cutting it or injuring a single hair on its body", " 'I like that very much indeed,' said the father", " 'Unless the others exert themselves to the utmost, the house will be yours", "' Soon after they saw a man driving a carriage furiously towards them", " 'Now, father, you shall see what I can do!' said the blacksmith, and he sprang after the carriage, tore off the four shoes of the horse as it was going at the top of its speed, and shod it with four new ones without checking its pace", " 'You are a clever fellow!' said the father, 'and know your trade as well as your brother", " I really don't know to which of you I shall give the house", "' Then the third son said, 'Father, let me also show you something;' and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword and swung it in cross cuts above his head, so that not a drop fell on him, and the rain fell heavier and heavier, till at last it was coming down like a waterspout, but he swung his sword faster and faster, and kept as dry as if he were under cover", " When the father saw this he was astonished, and said, 'You have produced the greatest masterpiece: the house is yours", "' Both the other brothers were quite satisfied, and praised him too, and as they were so fond of each other they all three remained at home and plied their trades: and as they were so experienced and skilful they earned a great deal of money", ' So they lived happily together till they were quite old, and when one was taken ill and died the two others were so deeply grieved that they were also taken ill and died too  And so, because they had all been so clever, and so fond of each other, they were all laid in one grave   There was once upon a time a witch, who in the shape of a hawk used every night to break the windows of a certain village church  In the same village there lived three brothers, who were all determined to kill the mischievous hawk  But in vain did the two eldest mount guard in the church with their guns; as soon as the bird appeared high above their heads, sleep overpowered them, and they only awoke to hear the windows crashing in  Then the youngest brother took his turn of guarding the windows, and to prevent his being overcome by sleep he placed a lot of thorns under his chin, so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head, they would prick him and keep him awake  The moon was already risen, and it was as light as day, when suddenly he heard a fearful noise, and at the same time a terrible desire to sleep overpowered him  His eyelids closed, and his head sank on his shoulders, but the thorns ran into him and were so painful that he awoke at once  There was once a king who had three daughters  The two eldest were very proud and quarrelsome, but the youngest was as good as they were bad  Well, three princes came to court them, and two of them were exactly like the eldest ladies, and one was just as lovable as the youngest  One day they were all walking down to a lake that lay at the bottom of the lawn when they met a poor beggar', " The king wouldn't give him anything, and the eldest princesses wouldn't give him anything, nor their sweethearts; but the youngest daughter and her true love did give him something, and kind words along with it, and that was better than all", " When they got to the edge of the lake what did they find but the beautifullest boat you ever saw in your life; and says the eldest, 'I'll take a sail in this fine boat'; and says the second eldest, 'I'll take a sail in this fine boat'; and says the youngest, 'I won't take a sail in that fine boat, for I am afraid it's an enchanted one", "' But the others persuaded her to go in, and her father was just going in after her, when up sprung on the deck a little man only seven inches high, and ordered him to stand back", " Well, all the men put their hands to their swords; and if the same swords were only playthings, they weren't able to draw them, for all strength that was left their arms", ' Seven Inches loosened the silver chain that fastened the boat, and pushed away, and after grinning at the four men, says he to them', " 'Bid your daughters and your brides farewell for awhile", " You,' says he to the youngest, 'needn't fear, you'll recover your princess all in good time, and you and she will be as happy as the day is long", ' Bad people, if they were rolling stark naked in gold, would not be rich  Good-bye', "' Away they sailed, and the ladies stretched out their hands, but weren't able to say a word", " Well, they weren't crossing the lake while a cat 'ud be lickin' her ear, and the poor men couldn't stir hand or foot to follow them", ' They saw Seven Inches handing the three princesses out of the boat, and letting them down by a basket into a draw-well, but king nor princes ever saw an opening before in the same place  When the last lady was out of sight, the men found the strength in their arms and legs again  Round the lake they ran, and never drew rein till they came to the well and windlass; and there was the silk rope rolled on the axle, and the nice white basket hanging to it', " 'Let me down,' says the youngest prince", " 'I'll die or recover them again", "' 'No,' says the second daughter's sweetheart, 'it is my turn first", "' And says the other, 'I am the eldest", "' So they gave way to him, and in he got into the basket, and down they let him", ' First they lost sight of him, and then, after winding off a hundred perches of the silk rope, it slackened, and they stopped turning  They waited two hours, and then they went to dinner, because there was no pull made at the rope  Guards were set till next morning, and then down went the second prince, and sure enough, the youngest of all got himself let down on the third day  He went down perches and perches, while it was as dark about him as if he was in a big pot with a cover on  At last he saw a glimmer far down, and in a short time he felt the ground  Out he came from the big lime-kiln, and, lo! and behold you, there was a wood, and green fields, and a castle in a lawn, and a bright sky over all', " 'It's in Tir-na-n-Oge I am,' says he" ,  ' THERE was once upon a time a man who lost his wife, and a woman who lost her husband; and the man had a daughter and so had the woman  The two girls were great friends and used often to play together', " One day the woman turned to the man's daughter and said: 'Go and tell your father that I will marry him, and then you shall wash in milk and drink wine, but my own daughter shall wash in water and drink it too", "' The girl went straight home and told her father what the woman had said", " 'What am I to do?' he answered", " 'Marriage is either a success or it is a failure", "' At last, being of an undecided character and not being able to make up his mind, he took off his boot, and handing it to his daughter, said: 'Take this boot which has a hole in the sole, hang it up on a nail in the hayloft, and pour water into it", " If it holds water I will marry again, but if it doesn't I won't", "' The girl did as she was bid, but the water drew the hole together and the boot filled up to the very top", ' So she went and told her father the result  He got up and went to see for himself, and when he saw that it was true and no mistake, he accepted his fate, proposed to the widow, and they were married at once', " On the morning after the wedding, when the two girls awoke, milk was standing for the man's daughter to wash in and wine for her to drink; but for the woman's daughter, only water to wash in and only water to drink", " On the second morning, water to wash in and water to drink was standing for the man's daughter as well", " And on the third morning, water to wash in and water to drink was standing for the man's daughter, and milk to wash in and wine to drink for the woman's daughter; and so it continued ever after", ' The woman hated her stepdaughter from the bottom of her heart, and did all she could to make her life miserable  She was as jealous as she could possibly be, because the girl was so beautiful and charming, while her own daughter was both ugly and repulsive', " One winter's day when there was a hard frost, and mountain and valley were covered with snow, the woman made a dress of paper, and calling the girl to her said: 'There, put on this dress and go out into the wood and fetch me a basket of strawberries!' 'Now Heaven help us,' replied her stepdaughter; 'strawberries don't grow in winter; the earth is all frozen and the snow has covered up everything; and why send me in a paper dress? it is so cold outside that one's very breath freezes; the wind will whistle through my dress, and the brambles tear it from my body", "' 'How dare you contradict me!' said her stepmother; 'be off with you at once, and don't show your face again till you have filled the basket with strawberries", "' Then she gave her a hard crust of bread, saying: 'That will be enough for you to-day,' and she thought to herself: 'The girl will certainly perish of hunger and cold outside, and I shan't be bothered with her any more", "' The girl was so obedient that she put on the paper dress and set out with her little basket", ' There was nothing but snow far and near, and not a green blade of grass to be seen anywhere  When she came to the wood she saw a little house, and out of it peeped three little dwarfs  She wished them good-day, and knocked modestly at the door  They called out to her to enter, so she stepped in and sat down on a seat by the fire, wishing to warm herself and eat her breakfast', " The Dwarfs said at once: 'Give us some of your food!' 'Gladly,' she said, and breaking her crust in two, she gave them the half", ' Then they asked her what she was doing in the depths of winter in her thin dress', " 'Oh,' she answered, 'I have been sent to get a basketful of strawberries, and I daren't show my face again at home till I bring them with me", "' When she had finished her bread they gave her a broom and told her to sweep away the snow from the back door", ' As soon as she left the room to do so, the three little men consulted what they should give her as a reward for being so sweet and good, and for sharing her last crust with them', " The first said: 'Every day she shall grow prettier" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a man, whose wife had died; and a woman, also, who had lost her husband: and this man and this woman had each a daughter', " These two maidens were friendly with each other, and used to walk together, and one day they came by the widow's house", ' Then the widow said to the man\'s daughter, "Do you hear, tell your father I wish to marry him, and you shall every morning wash in milk and drink wine, but my daughter shall wash in water and drink water " So the girl went home and told her father what the woman had said, and he replied, "What shall I do? Marriage is a comfort, but it is also a torment " At last, as he could come to no conclusion, he drew off his boot and said: "Take this boot, which has a hole in the sole, and go with it out of doors and hang it on the great nail and then pour water into it  If it holds the water, I will again take a wife; but if it runs through, I will not have her " The girl did as he bid her, but the water drew the hole together and the boot became full to overflowing  So she told her father how it had happened, and he, getting up, saw it was quite true; and going to the widow he settled the matter, and the wedding was celebrated', " The next morning, when the two girls arose, milk to wash in and wine to drink were set for the man's daughter, but only water, both for washing and drinking, for the woman's daughter", " The second morning, water for washing and drinking stood before both the man's daughter and the woman's; and on the third morning, water to wash in and water to drink were set before the man's daughter, and milk to wash in and wine to drink before the woman's daughter, and so it continued", ' Soon the woman conceived a deadly hatred for her step-daughter, and knew not how to behave badly enough to her from day to day  She was envious, too, because her step-daughter was beautiful and lovely, and her own daughter was ugly and hateful  Once, in the winter-time, when the river was frozen as hard as a stone, and hill and valley were covered with snow, the woman made a cloak of paper, and called the maiden to her and said, "Put on this cloak, and go away into the wood to fetch me a little basketful of strawberries, for I have a wish for some " "Mercy on us!" said the maiden, "in winter there are no strawberries growing; the ground is frozen, and the snow, too, has covered everything', " And why must I go in that paper cloak? It is so cold out of doors that it freezes one's breath even, and if the wind does not blow off this cloak, the thorns will tear it from my body", '" "Will you dare to contradict me?" said the step-mother  "Make haste off, and let me not see you again until you have found me a basket of strawberries " Then she gave her a small piece of dry bread, saying, "On that you must subsist the whole day " But she thought--out of doors she will be frozen and starved, so that my eyes will never see her again! So the girl did as she was told, and put on the paper cloak, and went away with the basket  Far and near there was nothing but snow, and not a green blade was to be seen  When she came to the forest she discovered a little cottage, out of which three little Dwarfs were peeping  The girl wished them good morning, and knocked gently at the door  They called her in, and entering the room, she sat down on a bench by the fire to warm herself, and eat her breakfast  The Dwarfs called out, "Give us some of it!" "Willingly," she replied, and, dividing her bread in two, she gave them half  They asked, "What do you here in the forest, in the winter-time, in this thin cloak?" "Ah!" she answered, "I must, seek a basketful of strawberries, and I dare not return home until I can take them with me " When she had eaten her bread, they gave her a broom, saying, "Sweep away the snow with this from the back door " But when she was gone out of doors the three Dwarfs said one to another, "What shall we give her, because she is so gentle and good, and has shared her bread with us?" Then said the first, "I grant to her that she shall become more beautiful every day " The second said, "I grant that a piece of gold shall fall out of her mouth for every word she speaks " The third said, "I grant that a King shall come and make her his bride " Meanwhile, the girl had done as the Dwarf had bidden her, and had swept away the snow from behind the house  Once on a time there were three princes, who had a step-sister  One day they all set out hunting together  When they had gone some way through a thick wood they came on a great grey wolf with three cubs', " Just as they were going to shoot, the wolf spoke and said, 'Do not shoot me, and I will give each of you one of my young ones", ' It will be a faithful friend to you', "' So the princes went on their way, and a little wolf followed each of them", ' Soon after they came on a lioness with three cubs  And she too begged them not to shoot her, and she would give each of them a cub  And so it happened with a fox, a hare, a boar, and a bear, till each prince had quite a following of young beasts padding along behind him  Towards evening they came to a clearing in the wood, where three birches grew at the crossing of three roads  The eldest prince took an arrow, and shot it into the trunk of one of the birch trees', " Turning to his brothers he said: 'Let each of us mark one of these trees before we part on different ways", ' When any one of us comes back to this place, he must walk round the trees of the other two, and if he sees blood flowing from the mark in the tree he will know that that brother is dead, but if milk flows he will know that his brother is alive', "' So each of the princes did as the eldest brother had said, and when the three birches were marked by their arrows they turned to their step-sister and asked her with which of them she meant to live", " 'With the eldest,' she answered", ' Then the brothers separated from each other, and each of them set out down a different road, followed by their beasts  And the step-sister went with the eldest prince  After they had gone a little way along the road they came into a forest, and in one of the deepest glades they suddenly found themselves opposite a castle in which there lived a band of robbers  The prince walked up to the door and knocked  The moment it was opened the beasts rushed in, and each seized on a robber, killed him, and dragged the body down to the cellar  Now, one of the robbers was not really killed, only badly wounded, but he lay quite still and pretended to be dead like the others  Then the prince and his step-sister entered the castle and took up their abode in it  The next morning the prince went out hunting  Before leaving he told his step-sister that she might go into every room in the house except into the cave where the dead robbers lay  But as soon as his back was turned she forgot what he had said, and having wandered through all the other rooms she went down to the cellar and opened the door', " As soon as she looked in the robber who had only pretended to be dead sat up and said to her: 'Don't be afraid", ' Do what I tell you, and I will be your friend  If you marry me you will be much happier with me than with your brother  But you must first go into the sitting-room and look in the cupboard  There you will find three bottles' ,  " THERE was once upon a time a fisherman, who lived hard by a palace and fished for the King's table", ' One day he was out fishing, but caught nothing at all', " Let him do what he might with rod and line, there was never even so much as a sprat on his hook; but when the day was well nigh over, a head rose up out of the water, and said: 'If you will give me what your wife shows you when you go home, you shall catch fish enough", "' So the man said 'Yes' in a moment, and then he caught fish in plenty; but when he got home at night, and his wife showed him a baby which had just been born, and fell a-weeping and wailing when he told her of the promise which he had given, he was very unhappy", ' All this was soon told to the King up at the palace, and when he heard what sorrow the woman was in, and the reason of it, he said that he himself would take the child and see if he could not save it  The baby was a boy, and the King took him at once and brought him up as his own son until the lad grew up  Then one day he begged to have leave to go out with his father to fish; he had a strong desire to do this, he said  The King was very unwilling to permit it, but at last the lad got leave  He stayed with his father, and all went prosperously and well with them the whole day, until they came back to land in the evening  Then the lad found that he had lost his pocket-handkerchief, and would go out in the boat after it; but no sooner had he got into the boat than it began to move off with him so quickly that the water foamed all round about, and all that the lad did to keep the boat back with the oars was done to no purpose, for it went on and on the whole night through, and at last he came to a white strand that lay far, far away  There he landed, and when he had walked on for some distance he met an old man with a long white beard', " 'What is the name of this country?' said the youth", " 'Whiteland,' answered the man, and then he begged the youth to tell him whence he came and what he was going to do, and the youth did so", " 'Well, then,' said the man, 'if you walk on farther along the seashore here, you will come to three princesses who are standing in the earth so that their heads alone are out of it", ' Then the first of them will call you--she is the eldest--and will beg you very prettily to come to her and help her, and the second will do the same, but you must not go near either of them  Hurry past, as if you neither saw nor heard them; but you shall go to the third and do what she bids you; it will bring you good fortune', "' When the youth came to the first princess, she called to him and begged him to come to her very prettily, but he walked on as if he did not even see her, and he passed by the second in the same way, but he went up to the third", " 'If thou wilt do what I tell thee, thou shalt choose among us three,' said the Princess", ' So the lad said that he was most willing, and she told him that three Trolls had planted them all three there in the earth, but that formerly they had dwelt in the castle which he could see at some distance in the wood', " 'Now,' she said, 'thou shalt go into the castle, and let the Trolls beat thee one night for each of us, and if thou canst but endure that, thou wilt set us free", "' 'Yes,' answered the lad, 'I will certainly try to do so", "' 'When thou goest in,' continued the Princess, 'two lions will stand by the doorway, but if thou only goest straight between them they will do thee no harm; go straight forward into a small dark chamber; there thou shalt lie down", ' Then the Troll will come and beat thee, but thou shalt take the flask which is hanging on the wall, and anoint thyself wheresoever he has wounded thee, after which thou shalt be as well as before  Then lay hold of the sword which is hanging by the side of the flask, and smite the Troll dead', "' So he did what the Princess had told him", ' He walked straight in between the lions just as if he did not see them, and then into the small chamber, and lay down on the bed  The first night a Troll came with three heads and three rods, and beat the lad most unmercifully; but he held out until the Troll was done with him, and then he took the flask and rubbed himself  Having done this, he grasped the sword and smote the Troll dead  In the morning when he went to the sea-shore the Princesses were out of the earth as far as their waists  The next night everything happened in the same way, but the Troll who came then had six heads and six rods, and he beat him much more severely than the first had done but when the lad went out of doors next morning, the Princesses were out of the earth as far as their knees  Long, long ago, a king and queen reigned over a large and powerful country  What their names were nobody knows, but their son was called Sigurd, and their daughter Lineik, and these young people were famed throughout the whole kingdom for their wisdom and beauty  There was only a year between them, and they loved each other so much that they could do nothing apart  When they began to grow up the king gave them a house of their own to live in, with servants and carriages, and everything they could possibly want  For many years they all lived happily together, and then the queen fell ill, and knew that she would never get better', " 'Promise me two things,' she said one day to the king; 'one, that if you marry again, as indeed you must, you will not choose as your wife a woman from some small state or distant island, who knows nothing of the world, and will be taken up with thoughts of her grandeur", ' But rather seek out a princess of some great kingdom, who has been used to courts all her life, and holds them at their true worth  The other thing I have to ask is, that you will never cease to watch over our children, who will soon become your greatest joy', "' These were the queen's last words, and a few hours later she was dead", ' The king was so bowed down with sorrow that he would not attend even to the business of the kingdom, and at last his Prime Minister had to tell him that the people were complaining that they had nobody to right their wrongs', " 'You must rouse yourself, sir,' went on the minister, 'and put aside your own sorrows for the sake of your country", "' 'You do not spare me,' answered the king; 'but what you say is just, and your counsel is good", ' I have heard that men say, likewise, that it will be for the good of my kingdom for me to marry again, though my heart will never cease to be with my lost wife  But it was her wish also; therefore, to you I entrust the duty of finding a lady fitted to share my throne; only, see that she comes neither from a small town nor a remote island', "' So an embassy was prepared, with the minister at its head, to visit the greatest courts in the world, and to choose out a suitable princess", ' But the vessel which carried them had not been gone many days when a thick fog came on, and the captain could see neither to the right nor to the left  For a whole month the ship drifted about in darkness, till at length the fog lifted and they beheld a cliff jutting out just in front  On one side of the cliff lay a sheltered bay, in which the vessel was soon anchored, and though they did not know where they were, at any rate they felt sure of fresh fruit and water  The minister left the rest of his followers on board the ship, and taking a small boat rowed himself to land, in order to look about him and to find out if the island was really as deserted as it seemed  He had not gone far, when he heard the sound of music, and, turning in its direction, he saw a woman of marvellous beauty sitting on a low stool playing on a harp, while a girl beside her sang  The minister stopped and greeted the lady politely, and she replied with friendliness, asking him why he had come to such an out-of-the way place  In answer he told her of the object of his journey', " 'I am in the same state as your master,' replied the lady; 'I was married to a mighty king who ruled over this land, till Vikings came and slew him and put all the people to death", ' But I managed to escape, and hid myself here with my daughter', "' And the daughter listened, and said softly to her mother: 'Are you speaking the truth now?' 'Remember your promise,' answered the mother angrily, giving her a pinch which was unseen by the minister", " 'What is your name, madam?' asked he, much touched by this sad story", " 'Blauvor,' she replied 'and my daughter is called Laufer'; and then she inquired the name of the minister, and of the king his master", ' After this they talked of many things, and the lady showed herself learned in all that a woman should know, and even in much that men only were commonly taught', " 'What a wife she would make for the king,' thought the minister to himself, and before long he had begged the honour of her hand for his master", ' She declared at first that she was too unworthy to accept the position offered her, and that the minister would soon repent his choice; but this only made him the more eager, and in the end he gained her consent, and prevailed on her to return with him at once to his own country  Long, long ago, there lived an old man and his wife who had three sons; the eldest was called Martin, the second Michael, while the third was named Jack  One evening they were all seated round the table, eating their supper of bread and milk', " 'Martin,' said the old man suddenly, 'I feel that I cannot live much longer", ' You, as the eldest, will inherit this hut; but, if you value my blessing, be good to your mother and brothers', "' 'Certainly, father; how can you suppose I should do them wrong?' replied Martin indignantly, helping himself to all the best bits in the dish as he spoke", ' The old man saw nothing, but Michael looked on in surprise, and Jack was so astonished that he quite forgot to eat his own supper  A little while after, the father fell ill, and sent for his sons, who were out hunting, to bid him farewell  After giving good advice to the two eldest, he turned to Jack', " 'My boy,' he said, 'you have not got quite as much sense as other people, but if Heaven has deprived you of some of your wits, it was given you a kind heart", " Always listen to what it says, and take heed to the words of your mother and brothers, as well as you are able!' So saying the old man sank back on his pillows and died", ' The cries of grief uttered by Martin and Michael sounded through the house, but Jack remained by the bedside of his father, still and silent, as if he were dead also  At length he got up, and going into the garden, hid himself in some trees, and wept like a child, while his two brothers made ready for the funeral  No sooner was the old man buried than Martin and Michael agreed that they would go into the world together to seek their fortunes, while Jack stayed at home with their mother  Jack would have liked nothing better than to sit and dream by the fire, but the mother, who was very old herself, declared that there was no work for him to do, and that he must seek it with his brothers  So, one fine morning, all three set out; Martin and Michael carried two great bags full of food, but Jack carried nothing  This made his brothers very angry, for the day was hot and the bags were heavy, and about noon they sat down under a tree and began to eat  Jack was as hungry as they were, but he knew that it was no use asking for anything; and he threw himself under another tree, and wept bitterly', " 'Another time perhaps you won't be so lazy, and will bring food for yourself,' said Martin, but to his surprise Jack answered: 'You are a nice pair! You talk of seeking your fortunes so as not to be a burden on our mother, and you begin by carrying off all the food she has in the house!' This reply was so unexpected that for some moments neither of the brothers made any answer", ' Then they offered their brother some of their food, and when he had finished eating they went their way once more  Towards evening they reached a small hut, and knocking at the door, asked if they might spend the night there  The man, who was a wood-cutter, invited them him, and begged them to sit down to supper  Martin thanked him, but being very proud, explained that it was only shelter they wanted, as they had plenty of food with them; and he and Michael at once opened their bags and began to eat, while Jack hid himself in a corner  The wife, on seeing this, took pity on him, and called him to come and share their supper, which he gladly did, and very good he found it  At this, Martin regretted deeply that he had been so foolish as to refuse, for his bits of bread and cheese seemed very hard when he smelt the savoury soup his brother was enjoying', " 'He shan't have such a chance again,' thought he; and the next morning he insisted on plunging into a thick forest where they were likely to meet nobody", ' For a long time they wandered hither and thither, for they had no path to guide them; but at last they came upon a wide clearing, in the midst of which stood a castle', " Jack shouted with delight, but Martin, who was in a bad temper, said sharply: 'We must have taken a wrong turning! Let us go back", "' 'Idiot!' replied Michael, who was hungry too, and, like many people when they are hungry, very cross also", " 'We set out to travel through the world, and what does it matter if we go to the right or to the left?' And, without another word, took the path to the castle, closely followed by Jack, and after a moment by Martin likewise", ' The door of the castle stood open, and they entered a great hall, and looked about them  Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap  He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed  By chance a poor Brahman came by  "Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!" cried the tiger  "Nay, my friend," replied the Brahman mildly, "you would probably eat me if I did " "Not at all!" swore the tiger with many oaths; "on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!" Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman\'s heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage  Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, "What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!" In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger\'s action  So the Brahman first asked a _pipal_ tree what it thought of the matter, but the _pipal_ tree replied coldly, "What have you to complain about? Don\'t I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don\'t they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don\'t whimper--be a man!" Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, "You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!" The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion  "My dear sir," said the road, "how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!" On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, "Why, what\'s the matter, Mr  Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!" The Brahman told him all that had occurred  "How very confusing!" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; "would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?" The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand  "It\'s very odd," said he, sadly, "but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment " So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws  "You\'ve been away a long time!" growled the savage beast, "but now let us begin our dinner " "_Our_ dinner!" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; "what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!" "Give me five minutes, my lord!" he pleaded, "in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits " The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible  "Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!" cried the jackal, wringing its paws  "Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by----" "Pooh!" interrupted the tiger, "what a fool you are! _I_ was in the cage " "Of course!" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; "yes! I was in the cage--no I wasn\'t--dear! dear! where are my wits? Let me see--the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by----no, that\'s not it, either! Well, don\'t mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!" "Yes, you shall!" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal\'s stupidity; "I\'ll _make_ you understand! Look here--I am the tiger----" "Yes, my lord!" "And that is the Brahman----" "Yes, my lord!" "And that is the cage----" "Yes, my lord!" "And I was in the cage--do you understand?" "Yes--no---- Please, my lord----" "Well?" cried the tiger impatiently  "Please, my lord!--how did you get in?" "How!--why in the usual way, of course!" "Oh, dear me!--my head is beginning to whirl again! Please don\'t be angry, my lord, but what is the usual way?" At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried, "This way! Now do you understand how it was?" "Perfectly!" grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door, "and if you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they were!"    A soldier came marching along the high road--left, right! A left, right! He had his knapsack on his back and a sword by his side, for he had been to the wars and was now returning home  An old Witch met him on the road  She was very ugly to look at: her under-lip hung down to her breast', " 'Good evening, Soldier!' she said", " 'What a fine sword and knapsack you have! You are something like a soldier! You ought to have as much money as you would like to carry!' 'Thank you, old Witch,' said the Soldier", " 'Do you see that great tree there?' said the Witch, pointing to a tree beside them", " 'It is hollow within", ' You must climb up to the top, and then you will see a hole through which you can let yourself down into the tree  I will tie a rope round your waist, so that I may be able to pull you up again when you call', "' 'What shall I do down there?' asked the Soldier", " 'Get money!' answered the Witch", " 'Listen! When you reach the bottom of the tree you will find yourself in a large hall; it is light there, for there are more than three hundred lamps burning", ' Then you will see three doors, which you can open--the keys are in the locks', " If you go into the first room, you will see a great chest in the middle of the floor with a dog sitting upon it; he has eyes as large as saucers, but you needn't trouble about him", ' I will give you my blue-check apron, which you must spread out on the floor, and then go back quickly and fetch the dog and set him upon it; open the chest and take as much money as you like  It is copper there  If you would rather have silver, you must go into the next room, where there is a dog with eyes as large as mill-wheels', " But don't take any notice of him; just set him upon my apron, and help yourself to the money", ' If you prefer gold, you can get that too, if you go into the third room, and as much as you like to carry', " But the dog that guards the chest there has eyes as large as the Round Tower at Copenhagen! He is a savage dog, I can tell you; but you needn't be afraid of him either", " Only, put him on my apron and he won't touch you, and you can take out of the chest as much gold as you like!' 'Come, this is not bad!' said the Soldier", " 'But what am I to give you, old Witch; for surely you are not going to do this for nothing?' 'Yes, I am!' replied the Witch", " 'Not a single farthing will I take! For me you shall bring nothing but an old tinder-box which my grandmother forgot last time she was down there", "' 'Well, tie the rope round my waist! 'said the Soldier", " 'Here it is,' said the Witch, 'and here is my blue-check apron", "' Then the Soldier climbed up the tree, let himself down through the hole, and found himself standing, as the Witch had said, underground in the large hall, where the three hundred lamps were burning", ' Well, he opened the first door  Ugh! there sat the dog with eyes as big as saucers glaring at him', " 'You are a fine fellow!' said the Soldier, and put him on the Witch's apron, took as much copper as his pockets could hold; then he shut the chest, put the dog on it again, and went into the second room", ' Sure enough there sat the dog with eyes as large as mill-wheels The well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one; it was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise a bucketful of water over the edge of the well  Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well  Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race  They had, in fact, come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old Mother-Toad, who was still alive  The green Frogs, who had been established there a long time, and swam about in the water, called them "well-guests " But the new-comers seemed determined to stay where they were, for they found it very agreeable living "in a dry place," as they called the wet stones  The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller  She happened to be in the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became too strong for her, and she got a pain in her eyes  Fortunately she scrambled out of the bucket; but she fell into the water with a terrible flop, and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back  She certainly had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world  The Mother-Toad might have told this and that, if she had chosen, but she never answered when they asked her anything, and so they left off asking  "She\'s thick, and fat and ugly," said the young green Frogs; "and her children will be just as ugly as she is " "That may be," retorted the mother-Toad, "but one of them has a jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel " The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water  But the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, for each of them thought that he must have the jewel; and then they sat and held their heads quite still  But at length they asked what it was that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might be  "Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot describe it," said the Mother-Toad  "It\'s something which one carries about for one\'s own pleasure, and that makes other people angry', " But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you", '" "Well, I haven\'t got the jewel," said the smallest of the Toads; she was as ugly as a toad can be  "Why should I have such a precious thing? And if it makes others angry, it can\'t give me any pleasure  No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and look out; it must be beautiful up there " "You\'d better stay where you are," said the old Mother-Toad, "for you know everything here, and you can tell what you have  Take care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death; and even if you get into it safely, you may fall out', " And it's not every one who falls so cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole legs and whole bones", ' "Quack!" said the little Toad; and that\'s just as if one of us were to say, "Aha!" She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and to look over; she felt such a longing for the green, up there; and the next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up, filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone on which the Toad sat, the little creature\'s heart moved within it, and our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was drawn to the top, and emptied out  "Ugh, you beast!" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket, when he saw the toad  "You\'re the ugliest thing I\'ve seen for one while " And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad, which just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles which grew high by the well\'s brink  Here she saw stem by stem, but she looked up also; the sun shone through the leaves, which were quite transparent; and she felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the branches and leaves  Long, long ago in Japan there lived an old man and his wife  The old man was a good, kind-hearted, hard-working old fellow, but his wife was a regular cross-patch, who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue  She was always grumbling about something from morning to night  The old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness  He was out most of the day at work in the fields, and as he had no child, for his amusement when he came home, he kept a tame sparrow  He loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child', " When he came back at night after his hard day's work in the open air it was his only pleasure to pet the sparrow, to talk to her and to teach her little tricks, which she learned very quickly", ' The old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room, and they would play together  Then when supper-time came, he always saved some tit-bits from his meal with which to feed his little bird  Now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest, and the old woman stopped at home to wash clothes  The day before, she had made some starch, and now when she came to look for it, it was all gone; the bowl which she had filled full yesterday was quite empty  While she was wondering who could have used or stolen the starch, down flew the pet sparrow, and bowing her little feathered head--a trick which she had been taught by her master--the pretty bird chirped and said: "It is I who have taken the starch  I thought it was some food put out for me in that basin, and I ate it all  If I have made a mistake I beg you to forgive me! tweet, tweet, tweet!" You see from this that the sparrow was a truthful bird, and the old woman ought to have been willing to forgive her at once when she asked her pardon so nicely  But not so  The old woman had never loved the sparrow, and had often quarreled with her husband for keeping what she called a dirty bird about the house, saying that it only made extra work for her  Now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet', " She scolded and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior, and not content with using these harsh, unfeeling words, in a fit of rage she seized the sparrow--who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head before the old woman, to show how sorry she was--and fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little bird's tongue", ' "I suppose you took my starch with that tongue! Now you may see what it is like to go without it!" And with these dreadful words she drove the bird away, not caring in the least what might happen to it and without the smallest pity for its suffering, so unkind was she! The old woman, after she had driven the sparrow away, made some more rice-paste, grumbling all the time at the trouble, and after starching all her clothes, spread the things on boards to dry in the sun, instead of ironing them as they do in England  In the evening the old man came home  As usual, on the way back he looked forward to the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him, ruffling out her feathers to show her joy, and at last coming to rest on his shoulder  But to-night the old man was very disappointed, for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen  He quickened his steps, hastily drew off his straw sandals, and stepped on to the veranda  Still no sparrow was to be seen  He now felt sure that his wife, in one of her cross tempers, had shut the sparrow up in its cage  So he called her and said anxiously: "Where is Suzume San (Miss Sparrow) today?" The old woman pretended not to know at first, and answered: "Your sparrow? I am sure I don\'t know', " Now I come to think of it, I haven't seen her all the afternoon", ' I shouldn\'t wonder if the ungrateful bird had flown away and left you after all your petting!" But at last, when the old man gave her no peace, but asked her again and again, insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet, she confessed all  She told him crossly how the sparrow had eaten the rice-paste she had specially made for starching her clothes, and how when the sparrow had confessed to what she had done, in great anger she had taken her scissors and cut out her tongue, and how finally she had driven the bird away and forbidden her to return to the house again  Then the old woman showed her husband the sparrow\'s tongue, saying: "Here is the tongue I cut off! Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?" "How could you be so cruel? Oh! how could you so cruel?" was all that the old man could answer A whipping top and a little ball lay together in a box, among other toys, and the top said to the ball, "Shall we be married, as we live in the same box?" But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply  The next day came the little boy to whom the playthings belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was spinning round it looked splendid  "Look at me," said the top to the ball  "What do you say now? Shall we be engaged to each other? We should suit so well; you spring, and I dance  No one could be happier than we should be " "Indeed! do you think so? Perhaps you do not know that my father and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in my body " "Yes; but I am made of mahogany," said the top  "The major himself turned me  He has a turning lathe of his own, and it is a great amusement to him " "Can I believe it?" asked the ball  "May I never be whipped again," said the top, "if I am not telling you the truth " "You certainly know how to speak for yourself very well," said the ball; "but I cannot accept your proposal  I am almost engaged to a swallow', " Every time I fly up in the air, he puts his head out of the nest, and says, 'Will you?' and I have said, 'Yes,' to myself silently, and that is as good as being half engaged; but I will promise never to forget you", '" "Much good that will be to me," said the top; and they spoke to each other no more  Next day the ball was taken out by the boy  The top saw it flying high in the air, like a bird, till it would go quite out of sight  Each time it came back, as it touched the earth, it gave a higher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards, or from having a Spanish cork in its body  But the ninth time it rose in the air, it remained away, and did not return  The boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found; it was gone  "I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow\'s nest, and has married the swallow " The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball  His love increased the more, just because he could not get her; and that she should have been won by another, was the worst of all  The top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the ball; and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to his fancy  Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite old  The top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever; for he was gilded all over  He was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone  They searched everywhere, even in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found  Where could he be? He had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the gutter under the roof  "Now I am in a nice place," said he; "my gilding will soon be washed off here Poor John was very sad; for his father was so ill, he had no hope of his recovery  John sat alone with the sick man in the little room, and the lamp had nearly burnt out; for it was late in the night  "You have been a good son, John," said the sick father, "and God will help you on in the world " He looked at him, as he spoke, with mild, earnest eyes, drew a deep sigh, and died; yet it appeared as if he still slept  John wept bitterly  He had no one in the wide world now; neither father, mother, brother, nor sister', " Poor John! he knelt down by the bed, kissed his dead father's hand, and wept many, many bitter tears", ' But at last his eyes closed, and he fell asleep with his head resting against the hard bedpost  Then he dreamed a strange dream; he thought he saw the sun shining upon him, and his father alive and well, and even heard him laughing as he used to do when he was very happy  A beautiful girl, with a golden crown on her head, and long, shining hair, gave him her hand; and his father said, "See what a bride you have won  She is the loveliest maiden on the whole earth " Then he awoke, and all the beautiful things vanished before his eyes, his father lay dead on the bed, and he was all alone  Poor John! During the following week the dead man was buried  The son walked behind the coffin which contained his father, whom he so dearly loved, and would never again behold  He heard the earth fall on the coffin-lid, and watched it till only a corner remained in sight, and at last that also disappeared  He felt as if his heart would break with its weight of sorrow, till those who stood round the grave sang a psalm, and the sweet, holy tones brought tears into his eyes, which relieved him  The sun shone brightly down on the green trees, as if it would say, "You must not be so sorrowful, John  Do you see the beautiful blue sky above you? Your father is up there, and he prays to the loving Father of all, that you may do well in the future " "I will always be good," said John, "and then I shall go to be with my father in heaven  What joy it will be when we see each other again! How much I shall have to relate to him, and how many things he will be able to explain to me of the delights of heaven, and teach me as he once did on earth  Oh, what joy it will be!" He pictured it all so plainly to himself, that he smiled even while the tears ran down his cheeks  The little birds in the chestnut-trees twittered, "Tweet, tweet;" they were so happy, although they had seen the funeral; but they seemed as if they knew that the dead man was now in heaven, and that he had wings much larger and more beautiful than their own; and he was happy now, because he had been good here on earth, and they were glad of it', " John saw them fly away out of the green trees into the wide world, and he longed to fly with them; but first he cut out a large wooden cross, to place on his father's grave; and when he brought it there in the evening, he found the grave decked out with gravel and flowers", ' Strangers had done this; they who had known the good old father who was now dead, and who had loved him very much  Early the next morning, John packed up his little bundle of clothes, and placed all his money, which consisted of fifty dollars and a few shillings, in his girdle; with this he determined to try his fortune in the world  But first he went into the churchyard; and, by his father\'s grave, he offered up a prayer, and said, "Farewell " As he passed through the fields, all the flowers looked fresh and beautiful in the warm sunshine, and nodded in the wind, as if they wished to say, "Welcome to the green wood, where all is fresh and bright " Then John turned to have one more look at the old church, in which he had been christened in his infancy, and where his father had taken him every Sunday to hear the service and join in singing the psalms  As he looked at the old tower, he espied the ringer standing at one of the narrow openings, with his little pointed red cap on his head, and shading his eyes from the sun with his bent arm  John nodded farewell to him, and the little ringer waved his red cap, laid his hand on his heart, and kissed his hand to him a great many times, to show that he felt kindly towards him, and wished him a prosperous journey  There lived a tailor who had only one son, and he was extremely small, not any larger than your thumb, and so was called Tom Thumb  However, he was a courageous little fellow, and he told his father, "Father, I am determined to go into the world to seek my fortune " "Very well, my son," answered the old man, and taking a big darning needle, he made a top to it of sealing wax, and gave it to Tom Thumb, saying: "There is a sword for you to use to defend yourself on your journeyings " Then the little fellow, desiring to dine once more with his parents, popped into the kitchen to find out what his mother was preparing for his last dinner at home  All the dishes were ready to be taken in, and they were standing upon the hearth  "What is it you have for dinner, dear mother?" he inquired  "You can look for yourself," she replied  Then Tom sprang up on to the hob, and peeped into all the dishes, but over one he leant so far, that he was carried up by the steam through the chimney, and then for some distance he floated on the smoke, but after a while he fell upon the ground once more', " Now, at last, Tom Thumb was really out in the wide world, and he went on cheerily, and after a time was engaged by a master tailor; but here the food was not so good as his mother's, and it was not to his taste", ' So he said, "Mistress, if you will not give me better things to eat, I shall chalk upon your door, \'Too many potatoes, and not enough meat  Good-bye, potato-mill \'" "I should like to know what you want, you little grasshopper!" cried the woman very angrily, and she seized a shred of cloth to strike him; however, the tiny tailor popped under a thimble, and from it he peeped, putting out his tongue at the mistress  So she took up the thimble, meaning to catch him, but Tom Thumb hid himself amongst the shreds of cloth, and when she began to search through those, he slipped into a crack in the table, but put out his head to laugh at her; so she tried again to hit him with the shred, but did not succeed in doing so, for he slipped through the crack into the table drawer  At last, though, he was caught, and driven out of the house', " So the little fellow continued his travels, and presently entering a thick forest, he encountered a company of robbers who were plotting to steal the king's treasure", ' As soon as they saw the little tailor, they said to themselves, "A little fellow like this could creep through a keyhole, and aid us greatly " So one called out-- "Hullo, little man, will you come with us to the king\'s treasury? Certainly a Goliath like you could creep in with ease, and throw out the coins to us " After considering awhile, Tom Thumb consented, and accompanied them to the king\'s treasury  From top to bottom they inspected the door to discover a crack large enough for him to get through, and soon found one  He was for going in directly, but one of the sentinels happening to catch sight of him, exclaimed: "Here is indeed an ugly spider; I will crush it with my foot " "Leave the poor creature alone," the other said; "it has not done you any harm " So Tom Thumb slipped through the crack, and made his way to the treasury  Then he opened the window, and cast out the coins to the robbers who were waiting below  While the little tailor was engaged in this exciting employment, he heard the king coming to inspect his treasure, so as quickly as possible he crept out of sight  The king noticed that his treasure had been disarranged, and soon observed that coins were missing: but he was utterly unable to think how they could have been stolen, for the locks and bolts had not been tampered with, and everything was well fastened  On going from the treasury, he warned the two sentinels, saying-- "Be on the watch, some one is after the money," and quite soon, on Tom Thumb setting to work again, they heard very clearly the coins ringing, chink, chank, as they struck one against the other  As quickly as possible they unfastened the building and went in, hoping to take the thief  But Tom Thumb was too quick for them, he sprang into a corner, and hiding himself behind a coin, so that nothing of him was visible, he made fun of the sentinels; crying "I am here!" Then when the men hurried to the spot where the voice came from, he was no longer there, but from a different place cried out: "Ha, Ha! here I am!" So the sentinels kept jumping about, but so cleverly did Tom move from one spot to another, that they were obliged to run around the whole time, hoping to find somebody, until at length, quite tired out, they went off  Then Tomb Thumb went on with his work, and one after another he threw all the coins out of the window, but the very last he sounded and rang with all his might and springing nimbly upon it, so flew through the window  The robbers were loud in their praises  Once, long ago, in a little town that lay in the midst of high hills and wild forests, a party of shepherds sat one night in the kitchen of the inn talking over old times, and telling of the strange things that had befallen them in their youth  Presently up spoke the silver-haired Father Martin', " 'Comrades,' said he, 'you have had wonderful adventures; but I will tell you something still more astonishing that happened to myself", ' When I was a young lad I had no home and no one to care for me, and I wandered from village to village all over the country with my knapsack on my back; but as soon as I was old enough I took service with a shepherd in the mountains, and helped him for three years  One autumn evening as we drove the flock homeward ten sheep were missing, and the master bade me go and seek them in the forest  I took my dog with me, but he could find no trace of them, though we searched among the bushes till night fell; and then, as I did not know the country and could not find my way home in the dark, I decided to sleep under a tree  At midnight my dog became uneasy, and began to whine and creep close to me with his tail between his legs; by this I knew that something was wrong, and, looking about, I saw in the bright moonlight a figure standing beside me  It seemed to be a man with shaggy hair, and a long beard which hung down to his knees  He had a garland upon his head, and a girdle of oak-leaves about his body, and carried an uprooted fir-tree in his right hand  I shook like an aspen leaf at the sight, and my spirit quaked for fear  The strange being beckoned with his hand that I should follow him; but as I did not stir from the spot he spoke in a hoarse, grating voice: "Take courage, fainthearted shepherd  I am the Treasure Seeker of the mountain  If you will come with me you shall dig up much gold " \'Though I was still deadly cold with terror I plucked up my courage and said: "Get away from me, evil spirit; I do not desire your treasures " \'At this the spectre grinned in my face and cried mockingly: \'"Simpleton! Do you scorn your good fortune? Well, then, remain a ragamuffin all your days " \'He turned as if to go away from me, then came back again and said: "Bethink yourself, bethink yourself, rogue  I will fill your knapsack--I will fill your pouch " \'"Away from me, monster," I answered, "I will have nothing to do with you " \'When the apparition saw that I gave no heed to him he ceased to urge me, saying only: "Some day you will rue this," and looked at me sadly  Then he cried: "Listen to what I say, and lay it well to heart, it may be of use to you when you come to your senses  A vast treasure of gold and precious stones lies in safety deep under the earth  At twilight and at high noon it is hidden, but at midnight it may be dug up  For seven hundred years have I watched over it, but now my time has come; it is common property, let him find it who can  So I thought to give it into your hand, having a kindness for you because you feed your flock upon my mountain " \'Thereupon the spectre told me exactly where the treasure lay, and how to find it  It might be only yesterday so well do I remember every word he spoke  \'"Go towards the little mountains," said he, "and ask there for the Black King\'s Valley, and when you come to a tiny brook follow the stream till you reach the stone bridge beside the saw-mill  Do not cross the bridge, but keep to your right along the bank till a high rock stands before you  A bow-shot from that you will discover a little hollow like a grave  When you find this hollow dig it out; but it will be hard work, for the earth has been pressed down into it with care  There was once a lad who went to look for a place  As he went along he met a man, who asked him where he was going', " He told him his errand, and the stranger said, 'Then you can serve me; I am just in want of a lad like you, and I will give you good wages--a bushel of money the first year, two the second year, and three the third year, for you must serve me three years, and obey me in everything, however strange it seems to you", ' You need not be afraid of taking service with me, for there is no danger in it if you only know how to obey', "' The bargain was made, and the lad went home with the man to whom he had engaged himself", ' It was a strange place indeed, for he lived in a bank in the middle of the wild forest, and the lad saw there no other person than his master  The latter was a great troll, and had marvellous power over both men and beasts  Next day the lad had to begin his service  The first thing that the troll set him to was to feed all the wild animals from the forest  These the troll had tied up, and there were both wolves and bears, deer and hares, which the troll had gathered in the stalls and folds in his stable down beneath the ground, and that stable was a mile long  The boy, however, accomplished all this work on that day, and the troll praised him and said that it was very well done', " Next morning the troll said to him, 'To-day the animals are not to be fed; they don't get the like of that every day", ' You shall have leave to play about for a little, until they are to be fed again', "' Then the troll said some words to him which he did not understand, and with that the lad turned into a hare, and ran out into the wood", ' He got plenty to run for, too, for all the hunters aimed at him, and tried to shoot him, and the dogs barked and ran after him wherever they got wind of him  He was the only animal that was left in the wood now, for the troll had tied up all the others, and every hunter in the whole country was eager to knock him over  But in this they met with no success; there was no dog that could overtake him, and no marksman that could hit him  They shot and shot at him, and he ran and ran  It was an unquiet life, but in the long run he got used to it, when he saw that there was no danger in it, and it even amused him to befool all the hunters and dogs that were so eager after him  Thus a whole year passed, and when it was over the troll called him home, for he was now in his power like all the other animals  The troll then said some words to him which he did not understand, and the hare immediately became a human being again', " 'Well, how do you like to serve me?' said the troll, 'and how do you like being a hare?' The lad replied that he liked it very well; he had never been able to go over the ground so quickly before", ' The troll then showed him the bushel of money that he had already earned, and the lad was well pleased to serve him for another year', " The first day of the second year the boy had the same work to do as on the previous one--namely, to feed all the wild animals in the troll's stable", ' When he had done this the troll again said some words to him, and with that he became a raven, and flew high up into the air  This was delightful, the lad thought; he could go even faster now than when he was a hare, and the dogs could not come after him here  This was a great delight to him, but he soon found out that he was not to be left quite at peace, for all the marksmen and hunters who saw him aimed at him and fired away, for they had no other birds to shoot at than himself, as the troll had tied up all the others  This, however, he also got used to, when he saw that they could never hit him, and in this way he flew about all that year, until the troll called him home again, said some strange words to him, and gave him his human shape again', " 'Well, how did you like being a raven?' said the troll", " 'I liked it very well,' said the lad, 'for never in all my days have I been able to rise so high" ,  ' YOU know the tale of poor Little Red Riding-hood, that the Wolf deceived and devoured, with her cake, her little butter can, and her Grandmother; well, the true story happened quite differently, as we know now  And first of all the little girl was called and is still called Little Golden-hood; secondly, it was not she, nor the good grand-dame, but the wicked Wolf who was, in the end, caught and devoured  Only listen  The story begins something like the tale  There was once a little peasant girl, pretty and nice as a star in its season  Her real name was Blanchette, but she was more often called Little Golden-hood, on account of a wonderful little cloak with a hood, gold- and fire-coloured, which she always had on  This little hood was given her by her Grandmother, who was so old that she did not know her age; it ought to bring her good luck, for it was made of a ray of sunshine, she said  And as the good old woman was considered something of a witch, everyone thought the little hood rather bewitched too  And so it was, as you will see', " One day the mother said to the child: 'Let us see, my little Golden-hood, if you know now how to find your way by yourself", ' You shall take this good piece of cake to your Grandmother for a Sunday treat to-morrow', " You will ask her how she is, and come back at once, without stopping to chatter on the way with people you don't know", " Do you quite understand?' 'I quite understand,' replied Blanchette gaily", ' And off she went with the cake, quite proud of her errand  But the Grandmother lived in another village, and there was a big wood to cross before getting there', " At a turn of the road under the trees, suddenly 'Who goes there?' 'Friend Wolf", "' He had seen the child start alone, and the villain was waiting to devour her; when at the same moment he perceived some wood-cutters who might observe him, and he changed his mind", ' Instead of falling upon Blanchette he came frisking up to her like a good dog', " ''Tis you! my nice Little Golden-hood,' said he", ' So the little girl stops to talk with the Wolf, who, for all that, she did not know in the least', " 'You know me, then!' said she; 'what is your name?' 'My name is friend Wolf", " And where are you going thus, my pretty one, with your little basket on your arm?' 'I am going to my Grandmother, to take her a good piece of cake for her Sunday treat to-morrow", "' 'And where does she live, your Grandmother?' 'She lives at the other side of the wood, in the first house in the village, near the windmill, you know", "' 'Ah! yes! I know now,' said the Wolf", " 'Well, that's just where I'm going; I shall get there before you, no doubt, with your little bits of legs, and I'll tell her you're coming to see her; then she'll wait for you", "' Thereupon the Wolf cuts across the wood, and in five minutes arrives at the Grandmother's house", ' He knocks at the door: toc, toc  No answer  He knocks louder  Nobody  There was once a turtle who lived among a great many people of different kinds, in a large camp near a big river which was born right up amongst the snows, and flowed straight away south till it reached a sea where the water was always hot  There were many other turtles in the camp, and this turtle was kind and pleasant to them all, but he did not care for any of them very much, and felt rather lonely  At last he built himself a hut, and filled it with skins for seats, and made it as comfortable as any hut for miles round; and when it was quite finished he looked about among the young women to see which of them he should ask to be his wife', " It took him some time to make up his mind, for no turtle likes being hurried, but at length he found one girl who seemed prettier and more industrious than the rest, and one day he entered her home, and said: 'Will you marry me?' The young woman was so surprised at this question that she dropped the beaded slipper she was making, and stared at the turtle", " She felt inclined to laugh--the idea was so absurd; but she was kind-hearted and polite, so she looked as grave as she could, and answered: 'But how are you going to provide for a family? Why, when the camp moves, you will not even be able to keep up with the rest!' 'I can keep up with the best of them,' replied the turtle, tossing his head", ' But though he was very much offended he did not let the girl see it, and begged and, prayed her so hard to marry him that, at last, she consented, very unwillingly', " 'You will have to wait till the spring, though,' she said; 'I must make a great many slippers and dresses for myself, as I shall not have much time afterwards", "' This did not please the turtle; but he knew it was no use talking, so all he answered was: 'I shall go to war and take some captives, and I shall be away several months", ' And when I return I shall expect you to be ready to marry me', "' So he went back to his hut, and at once set about his preparations", ' The first thing he did was to call all his relations together, and ask them if they would come with him and make war on the people of a neighbouring village  The turtles, who were tired of doing nothing, agreed at once, and next day the whole tribe left the camp  The girl was standing at the door of her hut as they passed, and laughed out loud--they moved so slowly', " Her lover, who was marching at the head, grew very angry at this, and cried out: 'In four days from now you will be weeping instead of laughing, because there will be hundreds of miles between you and me", "' 'In four days,' replied the girl--who only promised to marry him in order to get rid of him--'in four days you will hardly be out of sight", "' 'Oh, I did not mean four days, but four YEARS,' answered the turtle, hastily; 'whatever happens I shall be back by then", "' The army marched on, till one day, when they felt as if they must have got half round the earth, though they were scarcely four miles from the camp, they found a large tree lying across their path", ' They looked at it with dismay, and the oldest among them put their heads together to see what was to be done', " 'Can't we manage to get past by the top?' asked one", " 'Why, it would take us YEARS,' exclaimed another", " 'Just look at all those tall green branches, spreading in every direction", " If once we got entangled in THEM, we should never get out again!' 'Well then, let us go round by the bottom,' said a third", " 'How are we to do that, when the roots have made a deep hole, and above that is a high bank?' replied a fourth", " 'No; the only way I can think of, is to burn a large hole in the trunk", "' And this they did, but the trunk was very thick, and would not burn through", " 'It is no use, we must give it up,' they agreed at last", " 'After all, nobody need ever know! We have been away such a long while that we might easily have had all sorts of adventures", "' And so the whole company turned homewards again", ' They took even longer to go back than they had to come, for they were tired and footsore with their journey  When they drew near the camp they plucked up their courage, and began to sing a war-song  THERE were once upon a time a King and a Queen who lived happily together, and they had twelve children, all of whom were boys', " One day the King said to his wife: 'If our thirteenth child is a girl, all her twelve brothers must die, so that she may be very rich and the kingdom hers alone", "' Then he ordered twelve coffins to be made, and filled them with shavings, and placed a little pillow in each", ' These he put away in an empty room, and, giving the key to his wife, he bade her tell no one of it', " The Queen grieved over the sad fate of her sons and refused to be comforted, so much so that the youngest boy, who was always with her, and whom she had christened Benjamin, said to her one day: 'Dear mother, why are you so sad?' 'My child,' she answered, 'I may not tell you the reason", "' But he left her no peace, till she went and unlocked the room and showed him the twelve coffins filled with shavings, and with the little pillow laid in each", " Then she said: 'My dearest Benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for you and your eleven brothers, because if I bring a girl into the world you are all to be killed and buried in them", "' She wept bitterly as she spoke, but her son comforted her and said: 'Don't cry, dear mother; we'll manage to escape somehow, and will fly for our lives", "' 'Yes,' replied his mother, 'that is what you must do--go with your eleven brothers out into the wood, and let one of you always sit on the highest tree you can find, keeping watch on the tower of the castle", ' If I give birth to a little son I will wave a white flag, and then you may safely return; but if I give birth to a little daughter I will wave a red flag, which will warn you to fly away as quickly as you can, and may the kind Heaven have pity on you  Every night I will get up and pray for you, in winter that you may always have a fire to warm yourselves by, and in summer that you may not languish in the heat', "' Then she blessed her sons and they set out into the wood", ' They found a very high oak tree, and there they sat, turn about, keeping their eyes always fixed on the castle tower  On the twelfth day, when the turn came to Benjamin, he noticed a flag waving in the air, but alas! it was not white, but blood red, the sign which told them they must all die', " When the brothers heard this they were very angry, and said: 'Shall we forsooth suffer death for the sake of a wretched girl? Let us swear vengeance, and vow that wherever and whenever we shall meet one of her sex, she shall die at our hands", "' Then they went their way deeper into the wood, and in the middle of it, where it was thickest and darkest, they came upon a little enchanted house which stood empty", " 'Here,' they said, 'let us take up our abode, and you, Benjamin, you are the youngest and weakest, you shall stay at home and keep house for us; we others will go out and fetch food", "' So they went forth into the wood, and shot hares and roe-deer, birds and wood-pigeons, and any other game they came across", ' They always brought their spoils home to Benjamin, who soon learnt to make them into dainty dishes  So they lived for ten years in this little house, and the time slipped merrily away  In the meantime their little sister at home was growing up quickly  She was kind-hearted and of a fair countenance, and she had a gold star right in the middle of her forehead', " One day a big washing was going on at the palace, and the girl looking down from her window saw twelve men's shirts hanging up to dry, and asked her mother: 'Who in the world do these shirts belong to? Surely they are far too small for my father?' And the Queen answered sadly: 'Dear child, they belong to your twelve brothers", "' 'But where are my twelve brothers?' said the girl", " 'I have never even heard of them", "' 'Heaven alone knows in what part of the wide world they are wandering,' replied her mother", ' Then she took the girl and opened the locked-up room; she showed her the twelve coffins filled with shavings, and with the little pillow laid in each', " 'These coffins,' she said, 'were intended for your brothers, but they stole secretly away before you were born", "' Then she to tell her all that had happened, and when she had finished her daughter said: 'Do not cry, dearest mother; I will go and seek my brothers till I find them", "' So she took the twelve shirts and went on straight into the middle of the big wood" ,  ' Long ago there lived two brothers, both of them very handsome, and both so very poor that they seldom had anything to eat but the fish which they caught  One day they had been out in their boat since sunrise without a single bite, and were just thinking of putting up their lines and going home to bed when they felt a little feeble tug, and, drawing in hastily, they found a tiny fish at the end of the hook', " 'What a wretched little creature!' cried one brother", " 'However, it is better than nothing, and I will bake him with bread crumbs and have him for supper", "' 'Oh, do not kill me yet!' begged the fish; 'I will bring you good luck--indeed I will!' 'You silly thing!' said the young man; 'I've caught you, and I shall eat you", "' But his brother was sorry for the fish, and put in a word for him", " 'Let the poor little fellow live", ' He would hardly make one bite, and, after all, how do we know we are not throwing away our luck! Put him back into the sea  It will be much better', "' 'If you will let me live,' said the fish, 'you will find on the sands to-morrow morning two beautiful horses splendidly saddled and bridled, and on them you can go through the world as knights seeking adventures", "' 'Oh dear, what nonsense!' exclaimed the elder; 'and, besides, what proof have we that you are speaking the truth?' But again the younger brother interposed: 'Oh, do let him live! You know if he is lying to us we can always catch him again", ' It is quite worth while trying', "' At last the young man gave in, and threw the fish back into the sea; and both brothers went supperless to bed, and wondered what fortune the next day would bring", ' At the first streaks of dawn they were both up, and in a very few minutes were running down to the shore  And there, just as the fish had said, stood two magnificent horses, saddled and bridled, and on their backs lay suits of armour and under-dresses, two swords, and two purses of gold', " 'There!' said the younger brother", " 'Are you not thankful you did not eat that fish? He has brought us good luck, and there is no knowing how great we may become! Now, we will each seek our own adventures", ' If you will take one road I will go the other', "' 'Very well,' replied the elder; 'but how shall we let each other know if we are both living?' 'Do you see this fig-tree?' said the younger", " 'Well, whenever we want news of each other we have only to come here and make a slit with our swords in the back", ' If milk flows, it is a sign that we are well and prosperous; but if, instead of milk, there is blood, then we are either dead or in great danger', "' Then the two brothers put on their armour, buckled their swords, and pocketed their purees; and, after taking a tender farewell of each other, they mounted their horses and went their various ways", ' The elder brother rode straight on till he reached the borders of a strange kingdom  He crossed the frontier, and soon found himself on the banks of a river; and before him, in the middle of the stream, a beautiful girl sat chained to a rock and weeping bitterly  For in this river dwelt a serpent with seven heads, who threatened to lay waste the whole land by breathing fire and flame from his nostrils unless the king sent him every morning a man for his breakfast  This had gone on so long that now there were no men left, and he had been obliged to send his own daughter instead, and the poor girl was waiting till the monster got hungry and felt inclined to eat her', " When the young man saw the maiden weeping bitterly he said to her, 'What is the matter, my poor girl?' 'Oh!' she answered, 'I am chained here till a horrible serpent with seven heads comes to eat me", ' Oh, sir, do not linger here, or he will eat you too', "' 'I shall stay,' replied the young man, 'for I mean to set you free", "' 'That is impossible" ,  ' Far, far away, in the midst of a pine forest, there lived a woman who had both a daughter and a stepdaughter  Ever since her own daughter was born the mother had given her all that she cried for, so she grew up to be as cross and disagreeable as she was ugly  Her stepsister, on the other hand, had spent her childhood in working hard to keep house for her father, who died soon after his second marriage; and she was as much beloved by the neighbours for her goodness and industry as she was for her beauty  As the years went on, the difference between the two girls grew more marked, and the old woman treated her stepdaughter worse than ever, and was always on the watch for some pretext for beating her, or depriving her of her food  Anything, however foolish, was good enough for this, and one day, when she could think of nothing better, she set both the girls to spin while sitting on the low wall of the well', " 'And you had better mind what you do,' said she, 'for the one whose thread breaks first shall be thrown to the bottom", "' But of course she took good care that her own daughter's flax was fine and strong, while the stepsister had only some coarse stuff, which no one would have thought of using", " As might be expected, in a very little while the poor girl's thread snapped, and the old woman, who had been watching from behind a door, seized her stepdaughter by her shoulders, and threw her into the well", " 'That is an end of you!' she said", ' But she was wrong, for it was only the beginning  Down, down, down went the girl--it seemed as if the well must reach to the very middle of the earth; but at last her feet touched the ground, and she found herself in a field more beautiful than even the summer pastures of her native mountains  Trees waved in the soft breeze, and flowers of the brightest colours danced in the grass', " And though she was quite alone, the girl's heart danced too, for she felt happier than she had since her father died", " So she walked on through the meadow till she came to an old tumbledown fence--so old that it was a wonder it managed to stand up at all, and it looked as if it depended for support on the old man's beard that climbed all over it", ' The girl paused for a moment as she came up, and gazed about for a place where she might safely cross', " But before she could move a voice cried from the fence: 'Do not hurt me, little maiden; I am so old, so old, I have not much longer to live", "' And the maiden answered: 'No, I will not hurt you; fear nothing", "' And then seeing a spot where the clematis grew less thickly than in other places, she jumped lightly over", " 'May all go well with thee,' said the fence, as the girl walked on", ' She soon left the meadow and turned into a path which ran between two flowery hedges  Right in front of her stood an oven, and through its open door she could see a pile of white loaves', " 'Eat as many loaves as you like, but do me no harm, little maiden,' cried the oven", " And the maiden told her to fear nothing, for she never hurt anything, and was very grateful for the oven's kindness in giving her such a beautiful white loaf", " When she had finished it, down to the last crumb, she shut the oven door and said: 'Good-morning", "' 'May all go well with thee,' said the oven, as the girl walked on", ' By-and-by she became very thirsty, and seeing a cow with a milk-pail hanging on her horn, turned towards her', " 'Milk me and drink as much as you will, little maiden,' cried the cow, 'but be sure you spill none on the ground; and do me no harm, for I have never harmed anyone", "' 'Nor I,' answered the girl; 'fear nothing", "' So she sat down and milked till the pail was nearly full", ' Then she drank it all up except a little drop at the bottom  Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kioto  At such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kioto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kioto, where the great Mikado had his palace  So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kioto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other  The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about travelling, and half way between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed  It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another frog before him! They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes  It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their ways', " 'What a pity we are not bigger,' said the Osaka frog; 'for then we could see both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on", "' 'Oh, that is easily managed,' returned the Kioto frog", " 'We have only got to stand up on our hind legs, and hold on to each other, and then we can each look at the town he is travelling to", "' This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his front paws on the shoulders of his friend, who had risen also", ' There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down  The Kioto frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose towards Kioto; but the foolish things forgot that when they stood up their great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their noses might point to the places to which they wanted to go their eyes beheld the places from which they had come', " 'Dear me!' cried the Osaka frog, 'Kioto is exactly like Osaka", ' It is certainly not worth such a long journey', " I shall go home!' 'If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kioto I should never have travelled all this way,' exclaimed the frog from Kioto, and as he spoke he took his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell down on the grass", ' Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for home again, and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and Kioto, which are as different to look at as two towns can be, were as like as two peas     It was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful  The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother  The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools  It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country  In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright  The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood  In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors  The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her  At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, "Peep, peep " "Quack, quack," said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves  Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes  "How large the world is," said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell  "Do you imagine this is the whole world?" asked the mother; "Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson\'s field, but I have never ventured to such a distance  Are you all out?" she continued, rising; "No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still  I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;" and she seated herself again on the nest  "Well, how are you getting on?" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit  "One egg is not hatched yet," said the duck, "it will not break  But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see " "Let me see the egg that will not break," said the duck; "I have no doubt it is a turkey\'s egg  I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water  I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose  I could not get them to venture in  Let me look at the egg', " Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim", '" "I think I will sit on it a little while longer," said the duck; "as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing " "Please yourself," said the old duck, and she went away  At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, "Peep, peep " It was very large and ugly  The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others  I wonder if it really is a turkey  On a bitter night somewhere between Christmas and the New Year, a man set out to walk to the neighbouring village  It was not many miles off, but the snow was so thick that there were no roads, or walls, or hedges left to guide him, and very soon he lost his way altogether, and was glad to get shelter from the wind behind a thick juniper tree  Here he resolved to spend the night, thinking that when the sun rose he would be able to see his path again  So he tucked his legs snugly under him like a hedgehog, rolled himself up in his sheepskin, and went to sleep', " How long he slept, I cannot tell you, but after awhile he became aware that some one was gently shaking him, while a stranger whispered, 'My good man, get up! If you lie there any more, you will be buried in the snow, and no one will ever know what became of you", "' The sleeper slowly raised his head from his furs, and opened his heavy eyes", ' Near him stood a long thin man, holding in his hand a young fir tree taller than himself', " 'Come with me,' said the man, 'a little way off we have made a large fire, and you will rest far better there than out upon this moor", "' The sleeper did not wait to be asked twice, but rose at once and followed the stranger", ' The snow was falling so fast that he could not see three steps in front of him, till the stranger waved his staff, when the drifts parted before them  Very soon they reached a wood, and saw the friendly glow of a fire', " 'What is your name?' asked the stranger, suddenly turning round", " 'I am called Hans, the son of Long Hans,' said the peasant", ' In front of the fire three men were sitting clothed in white, just as if it was summer, and for about thirty feet all round winter had been banished  The moss was dry and the plants green, while the grass seemed all alive with the hum of bees and cockchafers  But above the noise the son of Long Hans could hear the whistling of the wind and the crackling of the branches as they fell beneath the weight of the snow', " 'Well! you son of Long Hans, isn't this more comfortable than your juniper bush?' laughed the stranger, and for answer Hans replied he could not thank his friend enough for having brought him here, and, throwing off his sheepskin, rolled it up as a pillow", ' Then, after a hot drink which warmed both their hearts, they lay down on the ground  The stranger talked for a little to the other men in a language Hans did not understand, and after listening for a short time he once more fell asleep  When he awoke, neither wood nor fire was to be seen, and he did not know where he was  He rubbed his eyes, and began to recall the events of the night, thinking he must have been dreaming; but for all that, he could not make out how he came to be in this place  Suddenly a loud noise struck on his ear, and he felt the earth tremble beneath his feet  Hans listened for a moment, then resolved to go towards the place where the sound came from, hoping he might come across some human being  He found himself at length at the mouth of a rocky cave in which a fire seemed burning  He entered, and saw a huge forge, and a crowd of men in front of it, blowing bellows and wielding hammers, and to each anvil were seven men, and a set of more comical smiths could not be found if you searched all the world through! Their heads were bigger than their little bodies, and their hammers twice the size of themselves, but the strongest men on earth could not have handled their iron clubs more stoutly or given lustier blows  The little blacksmiths were clad in leather aprons, which covered them from their necks to their feet in front, and left their backs naked  On a high stool against the wall sat the man with the pinewood staff, watching sharply the way the little fellows did their work, and near him stood a large can, from which every now and then the workers would come and take a drink  The master no longer wore the white garments of the day before, but a black jerkin, held in its place by a leathern girdle with huge clasps  From time to time he would give his workmen a sign with his staff, for it was useless to speak amid such a noise  If any of them had noticed that there was a stranger present they took no heed of him, but went on with what they were doing  One fine day a Tailor was sitting on his bench by the window in very high spirits, sewing away most diligently, and presently up the street came a country woman, crying, "Good jams for sale! Good jams for sale!" This cry sounded nice in the Tailor\'s ears, and, poking his diminutive head out of the window, he called, "Here, my good woman, just bring your jams in here!" The woman mounted the three steps up to the Tailor\'s house with her large basket, and began to open all the pots together before him  He looked at them all, held them up to the light, smelt them, and at last said, "These jams seem to me to be very nice, so you may weigh me out two ounces, my good woman; I don\'t object even if you make it a quarter of a pound " The woman, who hoped to have met with a good customer, gave him all he wished, and went off grumbling, and in a very bad temper  "Now!" exclaimed the Tailor, "Heaven will send me a blessing on this jam, and give me fresh strength and vigor;" and, taking the bread from the cupboard, he cut himself a slice the size of the whole loaf, and spread the jam upon it  "That will taste very nice," said he; "but, before I take a bite, I will just finish this waistcoat " So he put the bread on the table and stitched away, making larger and larger stitches every time for joy  Meanwhile the smell of the jam rose to the ceiling, where many flies were sitting, and enticed them down, so that soon a great swarm of them had pitched on the bread  "Holloa! who asked you?" exclaimed the Tailor, driving away the uninvited visitors; but the flies, not understanding his words, would not be driven off, and came back in greater numbers than before  This put the little man in a great passion, and, snatching up in his anger a bag of cloth, he brought it down with a merciless swoop upon them  When he raised it again he counted as many as seven lying dead before him with outstretched legs  "What a fellow you are!" said he to himself, astonished at his own bravery  "The whole town must hear of this " In great haste he cut himself out a band, hemmed it, and then put on it in large letters, "SEVEN AT ONE BLOW!" "Ah," said he, "not one city alone, the whole world shall hear it!" and his heart danced with joy, like a puppy-dog\'s tail  The little Tailor bound the belt around his body, and made ready to travel forth into the wide world, feeling the workshop too small for his great deeds  Before he set out, however, he looked about his house to see if there were anything he could carry with him, but he found only an old cheese, which he pocketed, and observing a bird which was caught in the bushes before the door, he captured it, and put that in his pocket also  Soon after he set out boldly on his travels; and, as he was light and active, he felt no fatigue  His road led him up a hill, and when he arrived at the highest point of it he found a great Giant sitting there, who was gazing about him very composedly  But the little Tailor went boldly up, and said, "Good day, friend; truly you sit there and see the whole world stretched below you  I also am on my way thither to seek my fortune  Are you willing to go with me?" The Giant looked with scorn at the little Tailor, and said, "You rascal! you wretched creature!" "Perhaps so," replied the Tailor; "but here may be seen what sort of a man I am;" and, unbuttoning his coat, he showed the Giant his belt  The Giant read, "SEVEN AT ONE BLOW"; and supposing they were men whom the Tailor had killed, he felt some respect for him  Still he meant to try him first; so taking up a pebble, he squeezed it so hard that water dropped out of it  "Do as well as that," said he to the other, "if you have the strength " "If it be nothing harder than that," said the Tailor, "that\'s child\'s play " And, diving into his pocket, he pulled out the cheese and squeezed it till the whey ran out of it, and said, "Now, I fancy that I have done better than you " The Giant wondered what to say, and could not believe it of the little man; so, catching up another pebble, he flung it so high that it almost went out of sight, saying, "There, you pigmy, do that if you can " "Well done," said the Tailor; "but your pebble will fall down again to the ground  I will throw one up which will not come down;" and, dipping into his pocket, he took out the bird and threw it into the air  The bird, glad to be free, flew straight up, and then far away, and did not come back  "How does that little performance please you, friend?" asked the Tailor   I was the chief of the race--he had stricken my father dead--  But I gathered my fellows together; I swore I would strike off his head   Each of them looked like a king, and was noble in birth as in worth,  And each of them boasted he sprang from the oldest race upon earth   Each was as brave in the fight as the bravest hero of song,  And each of them liefer had died than have done one another a wrong', "  _He_ lived on an isle in the ocean--we sail'd on a Friday morn--  He that had slain my father the day before I was born", '  And we came to the isle in the ocean, and there on the shore was he   But a sudden blast blew us out and away through a boundless sea', "  And we came to the Silent Isle that we never had touched before,  Where a silent ocean always broke on a silent shore,  And the brooks glittered on in the light without sound, and the long   waterfalls  Poured in a thunderless plunge to the base of the mountain walls,  And the poplar and cypress unshaken by storm flourished up beyond sight  And the pine shot aloft from the crag to an unbelievable height,  And high in the heaven above it there flickered a songless lark,  And the cock couldn't crow, and the bull couldn't low, and the dog   couldn't bark", "  And round it we went, and thro' it, but never a murmur, a breath,  It was all of it fair as life, it was all of it quiet as death,  And we hated the beautiful Isle, for whenever we strove to speak  Our voices were thinner and fainter than any flittermouse shriek;  And the men that were mighty of tongue, and could raise such a battle-cry  That a hundred who heard it would rush on a thousand lances and die--  Oh, they to be dumb'd by the charm!--so fluster'd with anger were they  They almost fell on each other; but, after, we sailed away", "  And we came to the Isle of Shouting, we landed, a score of wild birds  Cried from the topmost summit with human voices and words;  Once in an hour they cried, and whenever their voices peal'd  The steer fell down at the plough and the harvest died from the field,  And the men dropt dead in the valleys and half of the cattle went lame,  And the roof sank in on the hearth, and the dwelling broke into flame;  And the shouting of these wild birds ran into the hearts of my crew,  Till they shouted along with the shouting, and seized one another and   slew;  But I drew them the one from the other; I saw that we could not stay,  And we left the dead to the birds and we sail'd with our wounded away", "  And we came to the Isle of Flowers, their breath met us out on the seas,  For the Spring and the middle Summer sat each on the lap of the breeze;  And the red passion-flower to the cliffs, and the dark-blue clematis   clung  And starr'd with a myriad blossom, the long convolvulus hung;  And the topmost spire of the mountain was lilies in lieu of snow,  And the lilies like glaciers winded down, running out below  Thro' the fire of the tulip and poppy, the blaze of gorse, and the blush  Of millions of roses that sprang without leaf or thorn from the bush;  And the whole isle-side flashing down from the peak without ever a tree  Swept like a torrent of gems from the sky to the blue of the sea;  And we roll'd upon capes of crocus and vaunted our kith and kin,  And we wallowed in beds of lilies, and chanted the triumph of Finn,  Till each like a golden image was pollen'd from head to feet  And each was as dry as a cricket, with thirst in the middle-day heat", '  Blossom, and blossom, and promise of blossom, but never a fruit!  And we hated the Flowering Isle, as we hated the isle that was mute,  And we tore up the flowers by the million and flung them in bight and   bay', "  And we left but a naked rock, and in anger we sail'd away", "  And we came to the Isle of Fruits: all round from the cliffs and the   capes,  Purple or amber dangled a hundred fathom of grapes,  And the warm melon lay, like a little sun, on the tawny sand,  And the fig ran up from the beach, and rioted over the land,  And the mountain arose, like a jewelled throne thro' the fragrant air,  Glowing with all-coloured plums, and with golden masses of pear,  And the crimson and scarlet of berries that flamed upon bine and vine,  But in every berry and fruit was the poisonous pleasure of wine:  And the peak of the mountain was apples, the hugest that ever were seen,  And they prest, as they grew, on each other, with hardly a leaflet   between", '  And all of them redder than rosiest health, or than utterest shame,  And setting, when Even descended, the very sunset aflame', "  And we stay'd three days, and we gorged and we madden'd till everyone   drew  His sword on his fellow to slay him, and ever they struck and they slew;  And myself I had eaten but sparsely, and fought till I sunder'd the fray,  Then I bade them remember my father's death, and we sail'd away", "  And we came to the Isle of Fire: we were lured by the light from afar,  For the peak sent up one league of fire to the Northern Star;  Lured by the glare and the blare, but scarcely could stand upright,  For the whole isle shudder'd and shook, like a man in a mortal affright;  We were giddy, besides, with the fruits we had gorged, and so crazed that   at last,  There were some leap'd into the fire; and away we sail'd, and we past  Over that undersea isle, where the water is clearer than air:  Down we look'd: what a garden! Oh, bliss, what a Paradise there!  Towers of a happier time, low down in a rainbow deep  Silent palaces, quiet fields of eternal sleep!  And three of the gentlest and best of my people, whate'er I could say,  Plunged head down in the sea, and the Paradise trembled away", "  And we came to the Bounteous Isle, where the heavens lean low on the   land,  And ever at dawn from the cloud glitter'd o'er us a sun-bright hand,  Then it opened, and dropped at the side of each man, as he rose from his   rest,  Bread enough for his need till the labourless day dipt under the West;  And we wandered about it, and thro' it", " Oh, never was time so good!  And we sang of the triumphs of Finn, and the boast of our ancient blood,  And we gazed at the wandering wave, as we sat by the gurgle of springs,  And we chanted the songs of the Bards and the glories of fairy kings;  But at length we began to be weary, to sigh, and to stretch and yawn,  Till we hated the Bounteous Isle, and the sun-bright hand of the dawn,  For there was not an enemy near, but the whole green isle was our own,  And we took to playing at ball, and we took to throwing the stone,  And we took to playing at battle, but that was a perilous play,  For the passion of battle was in us, we slew and we sail'd away", '  And we passed to the Isle of Witches, and heard their musical cry--  "Come to us, Oh, come, come," in the stormy red of a sky  Dashing the fires and the shadows of dawn on the beautiful shapes,  For a wild witch, naked as heaven, stood on each of the loftiest capes,  And a hundred ranged on the rocks, like white sea-birds in a row,  And a hundred gambled and pranced on the wrecks in the sand below,  And a hundred splashed from the ledges, and bosomed the burst of the   spray', "  But I knew we should fall on each other, and hastily sail'd away", "  And we came in an evil time to the Isle of the Double Towers,  One was of smooth-cut stone, one carved all over with flowers,  But an earthquake always moved in the hollows under the dells,  And they shock'd on each other and butted each other with clashing of   bells,  And the daws flew out of the Towers, and jangled and wrangled in vain,  And the clash and boom of the bells rang into the heart and brain,  Till the passion of battle was on us, and all took sides with the Towers,  There were some for the clean-cut stone, there were more for the carven   flowers,  And the wrathful thunder of God peal'd over us all the day,  For the one half slew the other, and, after, we sail'd away", "  And we came to the Isle of a Saint, who had sail'd with St", ' Brendan of   yore,  He had lived ever since on the isle, and his winters were fifteen score,  And his voice was low as from other worlds, and his eyes were sweet,  And his white hair sank to his heels, and his white beard fell to his   feet,  And he spake to me, "Oh, Maeldune, let be this purpose of thine!  Remember the words of the Lord, when He told us \'Vengeance is Mine!\'  His fathers have slain thy fathers, in war or in single strife,  Thy fathers have slain his fathers, each taken a life for a life,  Thy father had slain his father, how long shall the murder last?  Go back to the Isle of Finn and suffer the Past to be Past "  And we kiss\'d the fringe of his beard, and we pray\'d as we heard him   pray,  And the Holy Man he assoil\'d us, and sadly we sail\'d away   And we came to the Isle we were blown from, and there on the shore was   he,  The man that had slain my father  I saw him, and let him be   Oh, weary was I of the travel, the trouble, the strife, and the sin,  When I landed again with a tithe of my men on the Island of Finn   MY LORD BAG OF RICE  Long, long ago there lived, in Japan a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda, or "My Lord Bag of Rice " His true name was Fujiwara Hidesato, and there is a very interesting story of how he came to change his name  Floating in a basket on the River Nile, Princess Bathia, the daughter of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, found a tiny little water-babe  Princess Bathia was a widow and had no children, and she was so delighted that she took the child home to the palace and brought it up as her own  She called the babe Moses  He was a pretty little boy, full of fun and frolic as he grew up, and he became a favorite with everybody in the palace  Even the cruel King Pharaoh, who had ordered that all the Hebrew boy babes should be drowned, loved to play with him  His ministers of state and magicians, however, frowned when they saw Moses, as soon as he could toddle and talk, making a play-mate of the king  They warned Pharaoh that it was dangerous to give a strange child such privileges, but Princess Bathia only laughed at them  So did her mother, the queen, and King Pharaoh took no notice  When Moses was three years old, Princess Bathia gave a birthday party in his honor  It was really a big banquet and was attended by the king and queen and all the courtiers  Moses was seated at the head of the table and his eyes opened very wide with wonderment at everything he saw  It seemed such a ridiculous lot of solemn fuss to him  He would rather have played on the floor, or climbed on to the table, but of course they would not allow him  "What does all this mean?" he asked of the king who was seated next to him  "Tell me," and he playfully pulled King Pharaoh\'s beard  The courtiers looked on horrified, and Bilam, the chief magician, cried out, "Beware, O king, this is not play " "Heed not these words, my father," said the princess  "Bilam is ever warning thee', " If thou wert to take notice of all that he says, thou wouldst not have a moment's peace", ' Take our little babe on thy knee and play with him " To please the princess, King Pharaoh did so, and Moses amused himself by playing with the glittering jewels on his majesty\'s robes', " Then he looked up and stared hard at the king's head", ' "What is that?" he asked, pointing  "That is the royal crown," answered Pharaoh  "No it is not; it is only a funny hat," replied Moses  "Beware," chimed in Bilam, solemnly  "Let me put the hat on," said Moses, reaching up his little hands, and before they could stop him, he had taken the crown from the king\'s head and had put it on his own  Princess Bathia and the queen laughed merrily, but Bilam looked very grave  "Your majesty," he said, in a voice trembling with passion, "this is not the foolish play of a babe  This child, remember, is not as other children  Three brothers and one sister lived together in a small cottage, and they loved one another dearly', " One day the eldest brother, who had never done anything but amuse himself from sunrise to sunset, said to the rest, 'Let us all work hard, and perhaps we shall grow rich, and be able to build ourselves a palace", "' And his brothers and sister answered joyfully, 'Yes, we will all work!' So they fell to working with all their might, till at last they became rich, and were able to build themselves a beautiful palace; and everyone came from miles round to see its wonders, and to say how splendid it was", " No one thought of finding any faults, till at length an old woman, who had been walking through the rooms with a crowd of people, suddenly exclaimed, 'Yes, it is a splendid palace, but there is still something it needs!' 'And what may that be?' 'A church", "' When they heard this the brothers set to work again to earn some more money, and when they had got enough they set about building a church, which should be as large and beautiful as the palace itself", ' And after the church was finished greater numbers of people than ever flocked to see the palace and the church and vast gardens and magnificent halls', " But one day, as the brothers were as usual doing the honours to their guests, an old man turned to them and said, 'Yes, it is all most beautiful, but there is still something it needs!' 'And what may that be?' 'A pitcher of the water of life, a branch of the tree the smell of whose flowers gives eternal beauty, and the talking bird", "' 'And where am I to find all those?' 'Go to the mountain that is far off yonder, and you will find what you seek", "' After the old man had bowed politely and taken farewell of them the eldest brother said to the rest, 'I will go in search of the water of life, and the talking bird, and the tree of beauty", "' 'But suppose some evil thing befalls you?' asked his sister", " 'How shall we know?' 'You are right,' he replied; ' I had not thought of that!' Then they followed the old man, and said to him, 'My eldest brother wishes to seek for the water of life, and the tree of beauty, and the talking bird, that you tell him are needful to make our palace perfect", " But how shall we know if any evil thing befall him?' So the old man took them a knife, and gave it to them, saying, 'Keep this carefully, and as long as the blade is bright all is well; but if the blade is bloody, then know that evil has befallen him", "' The brothers thanked him, and departed, and went straight to the palace, where they found the young man making ready to set out for the mountain where the treasures he longed for lay hid", ' And he walked, and he walked, and he walked, till he had gone a great way, and there he met a giant', " 'Can you tell me how much further I have still to go before I reach that mountain yonder?' 'And why do you wish to go there?' 'I am seeking the water of life, the talking bird, and a branch of the tree of beauty", "' 'Many have passed by seeking those treasures, but none have ever come back; and you will never come back either, unless you mark my words", ' Follow this path, and when you reach the mountain you will find it covered with stones  Do not stop to look at them, but keep on your way  As you go you will hear scoffs and laughs behind you; it will be the stones that mock  Do not heed them; above all, do not turn round  If you do you will become as one of them  Walk straight on till you get to the top, and then take all you wish for', "' The young man thanked him for his counsel, and walked, and walked, and walked, till he reached the mountain", ' And as he climbed he heard behind him scoffs and jeers, but he kept his ears steadily closed to them', " At last the noise grew so loud that he lost patience, and he stooped to pick up a stone to hurl into the midst of the clamour, when suddenly his arm seemed to stiffen, and the next moment he was a stone himself! That day his sister, who thought her brother's steps were long in returning, took out the knife and found the blade was red as blood", ' Then she cried out to her brothers that something terrible had come to pass', " 'I will go and find him,' said the second", ' And he went  And he walked, and he walked, and he walked, till he met the giant, and asked him if he had seen a young man travelling towards the mountain', " And the giant answered, 'Yes, I have seen him pass, but I have not seen him come back" ,  ' Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who loved each other dearly, and would have been perfectly happy if they had only had a little son or daughter to play with', " They never talked about it, and always pretended that there was nothing in the world to wish for; but, sometimes when they looked at other people's children, their faces grew sad, and their courtiers and attendants knew the reason why", ' One day the queen was sitting alone by the side of a waterfall which sprung from some rocks in the large park adjoining the castle  She was feeling more than usually miserable, and had sent away her ladies so that no one might witness her grief  Suddenly she heard a rustling movement in the pool below the waterfall, and, on glancing up, she saw a large crab climbing on to a stone beside her', " 'Great queen,' said the crab, 'I am here to tell you that the desire of your heart will soon be granted", ' But first you must permit me to lead you to the palace of the fairies, which, though hard by, has never been seen by mortal eyes because of the thick clouds that surround it  When there you will know more; that is, if you will trust yourself to me', "' The queen had never before heard an animal speak, and was struck dumb with surprise", ' However, she was so enchanted at the words of the crab that she smiled sweetly and held out her hand; it was taken, not by the crab, which had stood there only a moment before, but by a little old woman smartly dressed in white and crimson with green ribbons in her grey hair  And, wonderful to say, not a drop of water fell from her clothes  The old woman ran lightly down a path along which the queen had been a hundred times before, but it seemed so different she could hardly believe it was the same  Instead of having to push her way through nettles and brambles, roses and jasmine hung about her head, while under her feet the ground was sweet with violets  The orange trees were so tall and thick that, even at mid-day, the sun was never too hot, and at the end of the path was a glimmer of something so dazzling that the queen had to shade her eyes, and peep at it only between her fingers', " 'What can it be?' she asked, turning to her guide; who answered: 'Oh, that is the fairies' palace, and here are some of them coming to meet us", "' As she spoke the gates swung back and six fairies approached, each bearing in her hand a flower made of precious stones, but so like a real one that it was only by touching you could tell the difference", " 'Madam,' they said, 'we know not how to thank you for this mark of your confidence, but have the happiness to tell you that in a short time you will have a little daughter", "' The queen was so enchanted at this news that she nearly fainted with joy; but when she was able to speak, she poured out all her gratitude to the fairies for their promised gift", " 'And now,' she said, 'I ought not to stay any longer, for my husband will think that I have run away, or that some evil beast has devoured me", "' In a little while it happened just as the fairies had foretold, and a baby girl was born in the palace", " Of course both the king and queen were delighted, and the child was called Desiree, which means 'desired,' for she had been 'desired' for five years before her birth", ' At first the queen could think of nothing but her new plaything, but then she remembered the fairies who had sent it to her  Bidding her ladies bring her the posy of jewelled flowers which had been given her at the palace, she took each flower in her hand and called it by name, and, in turn, each fairy appeared before her  But, as unluckily often happens, the one to whom she owed the most, the crab-fairy, was forgotten, and by this, as in the case of other babies you have read about, much mischief was wrought', " However, for the moment all was gaiety in the palace, and everybody inside ran to the windows to watch the fairies' carriages, for no two were alike", ' One had a car of ebony, drawn by white pigeons, another was lying back in her ivory chariot, driving ten black crows, while the rest had chosen rare woods or many-coloured sea-shells, with scarlet and blue macaws, long-tailed peacocks, or green love-birds for horses  These carriages were only used on occasions of state, for when they went to war flying dragons, fiery serpents, lions or leopards, took the place of the beautiful birds', " The fairies entered the queen's chamber followed by little dwarfs who carried their presents and looked much prouder than their mistresses", ' One by one their burdens were spread upon the ground, and no one had ever seen such lovely things  Everything that a baby could possibly wear or play with was there, and besides, they had other and more precious gifts to give her, which only children who have fairies for godmothers can ever hope to possess  A king had two sons  They were a pair of reckless fellows, who always had something foolish to do  One day they rowed out alone on the sea in a little boat  It was beautiful weather when they set out, but as soon as they had got some distance from the shore there arose a terrific storm  The oars went overboard at once, and the little boat was tossed about on the rolling billows like a nut-shell  The princes had to hold fast by the seats to keep from being thrown out of the boat  In the midst of all this they met a wonderful vessel--it was a dough-trough, in which there sat an old woman  She called to them, and said that they could still get to shore alive if they would promise her the son that was next to come to their mother the queen', " 'We can't do that,' shouted the princes; 'he doesn't belong to us so we can't give him away", "' 'Then you can rot at the bottom of the sea, both of you,' said the old woman; 'and perhaps it may be the case that your mother would rather keep the two sons she has than the one she hasn't got yet", "' Then she rowed away in her dough-trough, while the storm howled still louder than before, and the water dashed over their boat until it was almost sinking", ' Then the princes thought that there was something in what the old woman had said about their mother, and being, of course, eager to save their lives, they shouted to her, and promised that she should have their brother if she would deliver them from this danger  As soon as they had done so the storm ceased and the waves fell', " The boat drove ashore below their father's castle, and both princes were received with open arms by their father and mother, who had suffered great anxiety for them", " The two brothers said nothing about what they had promised, neither at that time nor later on when the queen's third son came, a beautiful boy, whom she loved more than anything else in the world", " He was brought up and educated in his father's house until he was full grown, and still his brothers had never seen or heard anything about the witch to whom they had promised him before he was born", ' It happened one evening that there arose a raging storm, with mist and darkness', " It howled and roared around the king's palace, and in the midst of it there came a loud knock on the door of the hall where the youngest prince was", ' He went to the door and found there an old woman with a dough- trough on her back, who said to him that he must go with her at once; his brothers had promised him to her if she would save their lives', " 'Yes,' said he; 'if you saved my brothers' lives, and they promised me to you, then I will go with you", "' They therefore went down to the beach together, where he had to take his seat in the trough, along with the witch, who sailed away with him, over the sea, home to her dwelling", " The prince was now in the witch's power, and in her service", ' The first thing she set him to was to pick feathers', " 'The heap of feathers that you see here,' said she, 'you must get finished before I come home in the evening, otherwise you shall be set to harder work", "' He started to the feathers, and picked and picked until there was only a single feather left that had not passed through his hands", ' But then there came a whirlwind and sent all the feathers flying, and swept them along the floor into a heap, where they lay as if they were trampled together  He had now to begin all his work over again, but by this time it only wanted an hour of evening, when the witch was to be expected home, and he easily saw that it was impossible for him to be finished by that time', " Then he heard something tapping at the window pane, and a thin voice said, 'Let me in, and I will help you", "' It was a white dove, which sat outside the window, and was pecking at it with its beak", ' He opened the window, and the dove came in and set to work at once, and picked all the feathers out of the heap with its beak  Once upon a time a great and powerful King married a lovely Princess  No couple were ever so happy; but before their honeymoon was over they were forced to part, for the King had to go on a warlike expedition to a far country, and leave his young wife alone at home  Bitter were the tears she shed, while her husband sought in vain to soothe her with words of comfort and counsel, warning her, above all things, never to leave the castle, to hold no intercourse with strangers, to beware of evil counsellors, and especially to be on her guard against strange women  And the Queen promised faithfully to obey her royal lord and master in these four matters  So when the King set out on his expedition she shut herself up with her ladies in her own apartments, and spent her time in spinning and weaving, and in thinking of her royal husband', " Often she was very sad and lonely, and it happened that one day while she was seated at the window, letting salt tears drop on her work, an old woman, a kind, homely-looking old body, stepped up to the window, and, leaning upon her crutch, addressed the Queen in friendly, flattering tones, saying: 'Why are you sad and cast down, fair Queen? You should not mope all day in your rooms, but should come out into the green garden, and hear the birds sing with joy among the trees, and see the butterflies fluttering above the flowers, and hear the bees and insects hum, and watch the sunbeams chase the dew-drops through the rose-leaves and in the lily-cups", ' All the brightness outside would help to drive away your cares, O Queen', "' For long the Queen resisted her coaxing words, remembering the promise she had given the King, her husband; but at last she thought to herself: After all, what harm would it do if I were to go into the garden for a short time and enjoy myself among the trees and flowers, and the singing birds and fluttering butterflies and humming insects, and look at the dew-drops hiding from the sunbeams in the hearts of the roses and lilies, and wander about in the sunshine, instead of remaining all day in this room? For she had no idea that the kind-looking old woman leaning on her crutch was in reality a wicked witch, who envied the Queen her good fortune, and was determined to ruin her", ' And so, in all ignorance, the Queen followed her out into the garden and listened to her smooth, flattering words', " Now, in the middle of the garden there was a pond of water, clear as crystal, and the old woman said to the Queen: 'The day is so warm, and the sun's rays so scorching, that the water in the pond looks very cool and inviting", " Would you not like to bathe in it, fair Queen?' 'No, I think not,' answered the Queen; but the next moment she regretted her words, and thought to herself: Why shouldn't I bathe in that cool, fresh water? No harm could come of it", ' And, so saying, she slipped off her robes and stepped into the water', " But scarcely had her tender feet touched the cool ripples when she felt a great shove on her shoulders, and the wicked witch had pushed her into the deep water, exclaiming: 'Swim henceforth, White Duck!' And the witch herself assumed the form of the Queen, and decked herself out in the royal robes, and sat among the Court ladies, awaiting the King's return", " And suddenly the tramp of horses' hoofs was heard, and the barking of dogs, and the witch hastened forward to meet the royal carriages, and, throwing her arms round the King's neck, kissed him", ' And in his great joy the King did not know that the woman he held in his arms was not his own dear wife, but a wicked witch  In the meantime, outside the palace walls, the poor White Duck swam up and down the pond; and near it laid three eggs, out of which there came one morning two little fluffy ducklings and a little ugly drake', " And the White Duck brought the little creatures up, and they paddled after her in the pond, and caught gold-fish, and hopped upon the bank and waddled about, ruffling their feathers and saying 'Quack, quack' as they strutted about on the green banks of the pond", " But their mother used to warn them not to stray too far, telling them that a wicked witch lived in the castle beyond the garden, adding, 'She has ruined me, and she will do her best to ruin you", "' But the young ones did not listen to their mother, and, playing about the garden one day, they strayed close up to the castle windows", ' The witch at once recognised them by their smell, and ground her teeth with anger; but she hid her feelings, and, pretending to be very kind she called them to her and joked with them, and led them into a beautiful room, where she gave them food to eat, and showed them a soft cushion on which they might sleep  Then she left them and went down into the palace kitchens, where she told the servants to sharpen the knives, and to make a great fire ready, and hang a large kettleful of water over it  In the meantime the two little ducklings had fallen asleep, and the little drake lay between them, covered up by their wings, to be kept warm under their feathers', " But the little drake could not go to sleep, and as he lay there wide awake in the night he heard the witch come to the door and say: 'Little ones, are you asleep?' And the little drake answered for the other two:      'We cannot sleep, we wake and weep,      Sharp is the knife, to take our life;      The fire is hot, now boils the pot,      And so we wake, and lie and quake", "' 'They are not asleep yet,' muttered the witch to herself; and she walked up and down in the passage, and then came back to the door, and said: 'Little ones, are you asleep?' And again the little drake answered for his sisters:      'We cannot sleep, we wake and weep,      Sharp is the knife, to take our life;      The fire is hot, now boils the pot,      And so we wake, and lie and quake", "' 'Just the same answer,' muttered the witch; 'I think I'll go in and see", "' So she opened the door gently, and seeing the two little ducklings sound asleep, she there and then killed them", ' The next morning the White Duck wandered round the pond in a distracted manner, looking for her little ones; she called and she searched, but could find no trace of them  And in her heart she had a foreboding that evil had befallen them, and she fluttered up out of the water and flew to the palace  And there, laid out on the marble floor of the court, dead and stone cold, were her three children', " The White Duck threw herself upon them, and, covering up their little bodies with her wings, she cried:      'Quack, quack--my little loves!      Quack, quack--my turtle-doves!       I brought you up with grief and pain,      And now before my eyes you're slain" ,  ' Long, long ago, when all the animals could talk, there lived in the province of Inaba in Japan, a little white hare  His home was on the island of Oki, and just across the sea was the mainland of Inaba  Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to Inaba  Day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of Inaba, and day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across  One day as usual, the hare was standing on the beach, looking towards the mainland across the water, when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island  "This is very lucky!" thought the hare  "Now I shall be able to get my wish  I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea!" But he was doubtful whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted  So he thought instead of asking a favor he would try to get what he wanted by a trick  So with a loud voice he called to the crocodile, and said: "Oh, Mr  Crocodile, isn\'t it a lovely day?" The crocodile, who had come out all by itself that day to enjoy the bright sunshine, was just beginning to feel a bit lonely when the hare\'s cheerful greeting broke the silence  The crocodile swam nearer the shore, very pleased to hear some one speak  "I wonder who it was that spoke to me just now! Was it you, Mr  Hare? You must be very lonely all by yourself!" "Oh, no, I am not at all lonely," said the hare, "but as it was such a fine day I came out here to enjoy myself  Won\'t you stop and play with me a little while?" The crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore, and the two played together for some time  Then the hare said: "Mr  Crocodile, you live in the sea and I live on this island, and we do not often meet, so I know very little about you  Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?" "Of course, there are more crocodiles than hares," answered the crocodile  "Can you not see that for yourself? You live on this small island, while I live in the sea, which spreads through all parts of the world, so if I call together all the crocodiles who dwell in the sea you hares will be as nothing compared to us!" The crocodile was very conceited  The hare, who meant to play a trick on the crocodile, said: "Do you think it possible for you to call up enough crocodiles to form a line from this island across the sea to Inaba?" The crocodile thought for a moment and then answered: "Of course, it is possible " "Then do try," said the artful hare, "and I will count the number from here!" The crocodile, who was very simple-minded, and who hadn\'t the least idea that the hare intended to play a trick on him, agreed to do what the hare asked, and said: "Wait a little while I go back into the sea and call my company together!" The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time  The hare, meanwhile, waited patiently on the shore  At last the crocodile appeared, bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles  "Look, Mr  Hare!" said the crocodile, "it is nothing for my friends to form a line between here and Inaba  There are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as China or India  Did you ever see so many crocodiles?" Then the whole company of crocodiles arranged themselves in the water so as to form a bridge between the Island of Oki and the mainland of Inaba  When the hare saw the bridge of crocodiles, he said: "How splendid! I did not believe this was possible  Now let me count you all! To do this, however, with your permission, I must walk over on your backs to the other side, so please be so good as not to move, or else I shall fall into the sea and be drowned!" So the hare hopped off the island on to the strange bridge of crocodiles, counting as he jumped from one crocodile\'s back to the other: "Please keep quite still, or I shall not be able to count  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine--" Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of Inaba  Once upon a time there lived a king who had a daughter just fifteen years old  And what a daughter! Even the mothers who had daughters of their own could not help allowing that the princess was much more beautiful and graceful than any of them; and, as for the fathers, if one of them ever beheld her by accident he could talk of nothing else for a whole day afterwards  Of course the king, whose name was Balancin, was the complete slave of his little girl from the moment he lifted her from the arms of her dead mother; indeed, he did not seem to know that there was anyone else in the world to love  Now Diamantina, for that was her name, did not reach her fifteenth birthday without proposals for marriage from every country under heaven; but be the suitor who he might, the king always said him nay  Behind the palace a large garden stretched away to the foot of some hills, and more than one river flowed through  Hither the princess would come each evening towards sunset, attended by her ladies, and gather herself the flowers that were to adorn her rooms  She also brought with her a pair of scissors to cut off the dead blooms, and a basket to put them in, so that when the sun rose next morning he might see nothing unsightly  When she had finished this task she would take a walk through the town, so that the poor people might have a chance of speaking with her, and telling her of their troubles; and then she would seek out her father, and together they would consult over the best means of giving help to those who needed it  But what has all this to do with the White Slipper? my readers will ask  Have patience, and you will see  Next to his daughter, Balancin loved hunting, and it was his custom to spend several mornings every week chasing the boars which abounded in the mountains a few miles from the city  One day, rushing downhill as fast as he could go, he put his foot into a hole and fell, rolling into a rocky pit of brambles', " The king's wounds were not very severe, but his face and hands were cut and torn, while his feet were in a worse plight still, for, instead of proper hunting boots, he only wore sandals, to enable him to run more swiftly", ' In a few days the king was as well as ever, and the signs of the scratches were almost gone; but one foot still remained very sore, where a thorn had pierced deeply and had festered  The best doctors in the kingdom treated it with all their skill; they bathed, and poulticed, and bandaged, but it was in vain  The foot only grew worse and worse, and became daily more swollen and painful  After everyone had tried his own particular cure, and found it fail, there came news of a wonderful doctor in some distant land who had healed the most astonishing diseases  On inquiring, it was found that he never left the walls of his own city, and expected his patients to come to see him; but, by dint of offering a large sum of money, the king persuaded the famous physician to undertake the journey to his own court', " On his arrival the doctor was led at once into the king's presence, and made a careful examination of his foot", " 'Alas! your majesty,' he said, when he had finished, 'the wound is beyond the power of man to heal; but though I cannot cure it, I can at least deaden the pain, and enable you to walk without so much suffering", "' 'Oh, if you can only do that,' cried the king, 'I shall be grateful to you for life! Give your own orders; they shall be obeyed", "' 'Then let your majesty bid the royal shoemaker make you a shoe of goat-skin very loose and comfortable, while I prepare a varnish to paint over it of which I alone have the secret!' So saying, the doctor bowed himself out, leaving the king more cheerful and hopeful than he had been for long", ' The days passed very slowly with him during the making of the shoe and the preparation of the varnish, but on the eighth morning the physician appeared, bringing with him the shoe in a case', " He drew it out to slip on the king's foot, and over the goat-skin he had rubbed a polish so white that the snow itself was not more dazzling", " 'While you wear this shoe you will not feel the slightest pain,' said the doctor", " 'For the balsam with which I have rubbed it inside and out has, besides its healing balm, the quality of strengthening the material it touches, so that, even were your majesty to live a thousand years, you would find the slipper just as fresh at the end of that time as it is now", "' The king was so eager to put it on that he hardly gave the physician time to finish", ' He snatched it from the case and thrust his foot into it, nearly weeping for joy when he found he could walk and run as easily as any beggar boy', " 'What can I give you?' he cried, holding out both hands to the man who had worked this wonder", " 'Stay with me, and I will heap on you riches greater than ever you dreamed of" ,  "There lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world, and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants' huts by fire, so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on the singed black trees", ' Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in her arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also there the soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served as new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse things than these soldiers! The prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take  His power increased day by day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his deeds  He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled  He erected magnificent palaces, churches, and halls, and all who saw these splendid buildings and great treasures exclaimed admiringly: "What a mighty prince!" But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities  The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: "What a mighty prince! But I must have more--much more  No power on earth must equal mine, far less exceed it " He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them  The conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city', " These kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers' feet when they sat at table, and live on the morsels which they left", ' At last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: "Prince, you are mighty indeed, but God\'s power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders " "Well," said the prince  "Then I will conquer God too " And in his haughtiness and foolish presumption he ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail through the air; it was gorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a gun  The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were at once loaded again  Hundreds of eagles were attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards the sun  The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds  Higher and higher rose the eagles up into the air; then God sent one of his numberless angels against the ship  The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones', " One drop of blood, one single drop, came out of the white feathers of the angel's wings and fell upon the ship in which the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth again; the strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared round the prince's head, and the clouds around--were they formed by the smoke rising up from the burnt cities?--took strange shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons", ' The prince was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank at last with a terrible shock into the branches of a large tree in the wood  "I will conquer God!" said the prince  "I have sworn it: my will must be done!" And he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with  He gathered warriors from all countries, so many that when they were placed side by side they covered the space of several miles  They entered the ships and the prince was approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats--one swarm of little gnats  They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats  Then he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that the gnats might no longer be able to reach him', " The servants carried out his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of the coverings, crept into the prince's ear and stung him", ' The place burnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood  Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat  One day a wolverine was out walking on the hill-side, when, on turning a corner, he suddenly saw a large rock', " 'Was that you I heard walking about just now?' he asked, for wolverines are cautious animals, and always like to know the reasons of things", " 'No, certainly not,' answered the rock; 'I don't know how to walk", "' 'But I SAW you walking,' continued the wolverine", " 'I am afraid that you were not taught to speak the truth,' retorted the rock", " 'You need not speak like that, for I have SEEN you walking,' replied the wolverine, 'though I am quite sure that you could never catch ME!' and he ran a little distance and then stopped to see if the rock was pursuing him; but, to his vexation, the rock was still in the same place", " Then the wolverine went up close, and struck the rock a blow with his paw, saying: 'Well, will you catch me NOW?' 'I can't walk, but I can ROLL,' answered the rock", " And the wolverine laughed and said: 'Oh, that will do just as well'; and began to run down the side of the mountain", " At first he went quite slowly, 'just to give the rock a chance,' he thought to himself; but soon he quickened his pace, for he found that the rock was almost at his heels", ' But the faster the wolverine ran, the faster the rock rolled, and by-and-by the little creature began to get very tired, and was sorry he had not left the rock to itself  Thinking that if he could manage to put on a spurt he would reach the forest of great trees at the bottom of the mountain, where the rock could not come, he gathered up all his strength, and instead of running he leaped over sticks and stones, but, whatever he did, the rock was always close behind him  At length he grew so weary that he could not even see where he was going, and catching his foot in a branch he tripped and fell', " The rock stopped at once, but there came a shriek from the wolverine: 'Get off, get off! can't you see that you are on my legs?' 'Why did you not leave me alone?' asked the rock", " 'I did not want to move--I hate moving", " But you WOULD have it, and I certainly sha'n't move now till I am forced to", "' 'I will call my brothers,' answered the wolverine", " 'There are many of them in the forest, and you will soon see that they are stronger than you", "' And he called, and called, and called, till wolves and foxes and all sorts of other creatures all came running to see what was the matter", " 'How DID you get under that rock?' asked they, making a ring round him; but they had to repeat their question several times before the wolverine would answer, for he, like many other persons, found it hard to confess that he had brought his troubles on himself", " 'Well, I was dull, and wanted someone to play with me,' he said at last, in sulky voice, 'and I challenged the rock to catch me", ' Of course I thought I could run the fastest; but I tripped, and it rolled on me  It was just an accident', "' 'It serves you right for being so silly,' said they; but they pushed and hauled at the rock for a long time without making it move an inch", " 'You are no good at all,' cried the wolverine crossly, for it was suffering great pain, 'and if you cannot get me free, I shall see what my friends the lightning and thunder can do", "' And he called loudly to the lightning to come and help him as quickly as possible", ' In a few minutes a dark cloud came rolling up the sky, giving out such terrific claps of thunder that the wolves and the foxes and all the other creatures ran helter-skelter in all directions', " But, frightened though they were, they did not forget to beg the lightning to take off the wolverine's coat and to free his legs, but to be careful not to hurt him", " So the lightning disappeared into the cloud for a moment to gather up fresh strength, and then came rushing down, right upon the rock, which it sent flying in all directions, and took the wolverine's coat so neatly that, though it was torn into tiny shreds, the wolverine himself was quite unharmed", " 'That was rather clumsy of you,' said he, standing up naked in his flesh", " 'Surely you could have split the rock without tearing my coat to bits!' And he stooped down to pick up the pieces" ,  'Far away in the land to which the swallows fly when it is winter, dwelt a king who had eleven sons, and one daughter, named Eliza  The eleven brothers were princes, and each went to school with a star on his breast, and a sword by his side  They wrote with diamond pencils on gold slates, and learnt their lessons so quickly and read so easily that every one might know they were princes  Their sister Eliza sat on a little stool of plate-glass, and had a book full of pictures, which had cost as much as half a kingdom  Oh, these children were indeed happy, but it was not to remain so always  Their father, who was king of the country, married a very wicked queen, who did not love the poor children at all  They knew this from the very first day after the wedding  In the palace there were great festivities, and the children played at receiving company; but instead of having, as usual, all the cakes and apples that were left, she gave them some sand in a tea-cup, and told them to pretend it was cake  The week after, she sent little Eliza into the country to a peasant and his wife, and then she told the king so many untrue things about the young princes, that he gave himself no more trouble respecting them  "Go out into the world and get your own living," said the queen  "Fly like great birds, who have no voice " But she could not make them ugly as she wished, for they were turned into eleven beautiful wild swans  Then, with a strange cry, they flew through the windows of the palace, over the park, to the forest beyond', " It was early morning when they passed the peasant's cottage, where their sister Eliza lay asleep in her room", ' They hovered over the roof, twisted their long necks and flapped their wings, but no one heard them or saw them, so they were at last obliged to fly away, high up in the clouds; and over the wide world they flew till they came to a thick, dark wood, which stretched far away to the seashore', " Poor little Eliza was alone in her room playing with a green leaf, for she had no other playthings, and she pierced a hole through the leaf, and looked through it at the sun, and it was as if she saw her brothers' clear eyes, and when the warm sun shone on her cheeks, she thought of all the kisses they had given her", ' One day passed just like another; sometimes the winds rustled through the leaves of the rose-bush, and would whisper to the roses, "Who can be more beautiful than you!" But the roses would shake their heads, and say, "Eliza is " And when the old woman sat at the cottage door on Sunday, and read her hymn-book, the wind would flutter the leaves, and say to the book, "Who can be more pious than you?" and then the hymn-book would answer "Eliza " And the roses and the hymn-book told the real truth  At fifteen she returned home, but when the queen saw how beautiful she was, she became full of spite and hatred towards her  Willingly would she have turned her into a swan, like her brothers, but she did not dare to do so yet, because the king wished to see his daughter  Early one morning the queen went into the bath-room; it was built of marble, and had soft cushions, trimmed with the most beautiful tapestry  She took three toads with her, and kissed them, and said to one, "When Eliza comes to the bath, seat yourself upon her head, that she may become as stupid as you are " Then she said to another, "Place yourself on her forehead, that she may become as ugly as you are, and that her father may not know her " "Rest on her heart," she whispered to the third, "then she will have evil inclinations, and suffer in consequence " So she put the toads into the clear water, and they turned green immediately  She next called Eliza, and helped her to undress and get into the bath  As Eliza dipped her head under the water, one of the toads sat on her hair, a second on her forehead, and a third on her breast, but she did not seem to notice them, and when she rose out of the water, there were three red poppies floating upon it  Had not the creatures been venomous or been kissed by the witch, they would have been changed into red roses', " At all events they became flowers, because they had rested on Eliza's head, and on her heart" ,  'There was a man who once knew many stories, but they had slipped away from him--so he said  The Story that used to visit him of its own accord no longer came and knocked at his door  And why did it come no longer? It is true enough that for days and years the man had not thought of it, had not expected it to come and knock; and if he had expected it, it would certainly not have come; for without there was war, and within was the care and sorrow that war brings with it', " The stork and the swallows came back from their long journey, for they thought of no danger; and, behold, when they arrived, the nest was burnt, the habitations of men were burnt, the hedges were all in disorder, and everything seemed gone, and the enemy's horses were stamping in the old graves", ' Those were hard, gloomy times, but they came to an end  And now they were past and gone--so people said; yet no Story came and knocked at the door, or gave any tidings of its presence  "I suppose it must be dead, or gone away with many other things," said the man  But the story never dies  And more than a whole year went by, and he longed--oh, so very much!--for the Story  "I wonder if the Story will ever come back again and knock?" And he remembered it so well in all the various forms in which it had come to him, sometimes young and charming, like spring itself, sometimes as a beautiful maiden, with a wreath of thyme in her hair, and a beechen branch in her hand, and with eyes that gleamed like deep woodland lakes in the bright sunshine  Sometimes it had come to him in the guise of a peddler, and had opened its box and let silver ribbon come fluttering out, with verses and inscriptions of old remembrances  But it was most charming of all when it came as an old grandmother, with silvery hair, and such large, sensible eyes  She knew so well how to tell about the oldest times, long before the princesses spun with the golden spindles, and the dragons lay outside the castles, guarding them  She told with such an air of truth, that black spots danced before the eyes of all who heard her, and the floor became black with human blood; terrible to see and to hear, and yet so entertaining, because such a long time had passed since it all happened  "Will it ever knock at my door again?" said the man, and he gazed at the door, so that black spots came before his eyes and upon the floor; he did not know if it was blood, or mourning crape from the dark heavy days  And as he sat thus, the thought came upon him whether the Story might not have hidden itself, like the princess in the old tale  And he would now go in search of it; if he found it, it would beam in new splendor, lovelier than ever  "Who knows? Perhaps it has hidden itself in the straw that balances on the margin of the well  Carefully, carefully! Perhaps it lies hidden in a certain flower--that flower in one of the great books on the book-shelf " And the man went and opened one of the newest books, to gain information on this point; but there was no flower to be found  There he read about Holger Danske; and the man read that the tale had been invented and put together by a monk in France, that it was a romance, "translated into Danish and printed in that language;" that Holger Danske had never really lived, and consequently could never come again, as we have sung, and have been so glad to believe  And William Tell was treated just like Holger Danske  These were all only myths--nothing on which we could depend; and yet it is all written in a very learned book  "Well, I shall believe what I believe!" said the man  "There grows no plantain where no foot has trod " And he closed the book and put it back in its place, and went to the fresh flowers at the window  Perhaps the Story might have hidden itself in the red tulips, with the golden yellow edges, or in the fresh rose, or in the beaming camellia  The sunshine lay among the flowers, but no Story  The flowers which had been here in the dark troublous time had been much more beautiful; but they had been cut off, one after another, to be woven into wreaths and placed in coffins, and the flag had waved over them! Perhaps the Story had been buried with the flowers; but then the flowers would have known of it, and the coffin would have heard it, and every little blade of grass that shot forth would have told of it  The Story never dies A windmill stood upon the hill, proud to look at, and it was proud too  "I am not proud at all," it said, "but I am very much enlightened without and within  I have sun and moon for my outward use, and for inward use too; and into the bargain I have stearine candles, train oil and lamps, and tallow candles', " I may well say that I'm enlightened", " I'm a thinking being, and so well constructed that it's quite delightful", ' I have a good windpipe in my chest, and I have four wings that are placed outside my head, just beneath my hat  The birds have only two wings, and are obliged to carry them on their backs  I am a Dutchman by birth, that may be seen by my figure--a flying Dutchman  They are considered supernatural beings, I know, and yet I am quite natural', " I have a gallery round my chest, and house-room beneath it; that's where my thoughts dwell", " My strongest thought, who rules and reigns, is called by others 'The Man in the Mill", "' He knows what he wants, and is lord over the meal and the bran; but he has his companion, too, and she calls herself 'Mother", "' She is the very heart of me", " She does not run about stupidly and awkwardly, for she knows what she wants, she knows what she can do, she's as soft as a zephyr and as strong as a storm; she knows how to begin a thing carefully, and to have her own way", ' She is my soft temper, and the father is my hard one', " They are two, and yet one; they each call the other 'My half", "' These two have some little boys, young thoughts, that can grow", ' The little ones keep everything in order', " When, lately, in my wisdom, I let the father and the boys examine my throat and the hole in my chest, to see what was going on there,--for something in me was out of order, and it's well to examine one's self,--the little ones made a tremendous noise", ' The youngest jumped up into my hat, and shouted so there that it tickled me  The little thoughts may grow--I know that very well; and out in the world thoughts come too, and not only of my kind, for as far as I can see, I cannot discern anything like myself; but the wingless houses, whose throats make no noise, have thoughts too, and these come to my thoughts, and make love to them, as it is called', " It's wonderful enough--yes, there are many wonderful things", ' Something has come over me, or into me,--something has changed in the mill-work  It seems as if the one half, the father, had altered, and had received a better temper and a more affectionate helpmate--so young and good, and yet the same, only more gentle and good through the course of time  What was bitter has passed away, and the whole is much more comfortable  "The days go on, and the days come nearer and nearer to clearness and to joy; and then a day will come when it will be over with me; but not over altogether  I must be pulled down that I may be built up again; I shall cease, but yet shall live on', " To become quite a different being, and yet remain the same! That's difficult for me to understand, however enlightened I may be with sun, moon, stearine, train oil, and tallow", ' My old wood-work and my old brick-work will rise again from the dust! "I will hope that I may keep my old thoughts, the father in the mill, and the mother, great ones and little ones--the family; for I call them all, great and little, the company of thoughts, because I must, and cannot refrain from it  "And I must also remain \'myself,\' with my throat in my chest, my wings on my head, the gallery round my body; else I should not know myself, nor could the others know me, and say, \'There\'s the mill on the hill, proud to look at, and yet not proud at all  There was once a king and queen who had a little boy, and they called his name Kilweh  The queen, his mother, fell ill soon after his birth, and as she could not take care of him herself she sent him to a woman she knew up in the mountains, so that he might learn to go out in all weathers, and bear heat and cold, and grow tall and strong  Kilweh was quite happy with his nurse, and ran races and climbed hills with the children who were his playfellows, and in the winter, when the snow lay on the ground, sometimes a man with a harp would stop and beg for shelter, and in return would sing them songs of strange things that had happened in the years gone by', " But long before this changes had taken place in the court of Kilweh's father", " Soon after she had sent her baby away the queen became much worse, and at length, seeing that she was going to die, she called her husband to her and said: 'Never again shall I rise from this bed, and by and bye thou wilt take another wife", ' But lest she should make thee forget thy son, I charge thee that thou take not a wife until thou see a briar with two blossoms upon my grave', "' And this he promised her", ' Then she further bade him to see to her grave that nothing might grow thereon', " This likewise he promised her, and soon she died, and for seven years the king sent a man every morning to see that nothing was growing on the queen's grave, but at the end of seven years he forgot", ' One day when the king was out hunting he rode past the place where the queen lay buried, and there he saw a briar growing with two blossoms on it', " 'It is time that I took a wife,' said he, and after long looking he found one", ' But he did not tell her about his son; indeed he hardly remembered that he had one till she heard it at last from an old woman whom she had gone to visit', " And the new queen was very pleased, and sent messengers to fetch the boy, and in his father's court he stayed, while the years went by till one day the queen told him that a prophecy had foretold that he was to win for his wife Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr", ' When he heard this Kilweh felt proud and happy  Surely he must be a man now, he thought, or there would be no talk of a wife for him, and his mind dwelt all day upon his promised bride, and what she would be like when he beheld her', " 'What aileth thee, my son?' asked his father at last, when Kilweh had forgotten something he had been bidden to do, and Kilweh blushed red as he answered: 'My stepmother says that none but Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr, shall be my wife", "' 'That will be easily fulfilled,' replied his father", " 'Arthur the king is thy cousin", ' Go therefore unto him and beg him to cut thy hair, and to grant thee this boon', "' Then the youth pricked forth upon a dapple grey horse of four years old, with a bridle of linked gold, and gold upon his saddle", ' In his hand he bore two spears of silver with heads of steel; a war-horn of ivory was slung round his shoulder, and by his side hung a golden sword  Before him were two brindled white-breasted greyhounds with collars of rubies round their necks, and the one that was on the left side bounded across to the right side, and the one on the right to the left, and like two sea-swallows sported round him  And his horse cast up four sods with his four hoofs, like four swallows in the air about his head, now above, now below  About him was a robe of purple, and an apple of gold was at each corner, and every one of the apples was of the value of a hundred cows', " And the blades of grass bent not beneath him, so light were his horse's feet as he journeyed toward the gate of Arthur's palace", " 'Is there a porter?' cried Kilweh, looking round for someone to open the gate", " 'There is; and I am Arthur's porter every first day of January,' answered a man coming out to him", " 'The rest of the year there are other porters, and among them Pennpingyon, who goes upon his head to save his feet", "' 'Well, open the portal, I say", "' 'No, that I may not do, for none can enter save the son of a king or a pedlar who has goods to sell" ,  ' Once upon a time there was a peasant whose wife died, leaving him with two children--twins--a boy and a girl  For some years the poor man lived on alone with the children, caring for them as best he could; but everything in the house seemed to go wrong without a woman to look after it, and at last he made up his mind to marry again, feeling that a wife would bring peace and order to his household and take care of his motherless children  So he married, and in the following years several children were born to him; but peace and order did not come to the household  For the step-mother was very cruel to the twins, and beat them, and half-starved them, and constantly drove them out of the house; for her one idea was to get them out of the way  All day she thought of nothing but how she should get rid of them; and at last an evil idea came into her head, and she determined to send them out into the great gloomy wood where a wicked witch lived', " And so one morning she spoke to them, saying: 'You have been such good children that I am going to send you to visit my granny, who lives in a dear little hut in the wood", ' You will have to wait upon her and serve her, but you will be well rewarded, for she will give you the best of everything', "' So the children left the house together; and the little sister, who was very wise for her years, said to the brother: 'We will first go and see our own dear grandmother, and tell her where our step-mother is sending us", "' And when the grandmother heard where they were going, she cried and said: 'You poor motherless children! How I pity you; and yet I can do nothing to help you! Your step-mother is not sending you to her granny, but to a wicked witch who lives in that great gloomy wood", ' Now listen to me, children  You must be civil and kind to everyone, and never say a cross word to anyone, and never touch a crumb belonging to anyone else', " Who knows if, after all, help may not be sent to you?' And she gave her grandchildren a bottle of milk and a piece of ham and a loaf of bread, and they set out for the great gloomy wood", ' When they reached it they saw in front of them, in the thickest of the trees, a queer little hut, and when they looked into it, there lay the witch, with her head on the threshold of the door, with one foot in one corner and the other in the other corner, and her knees cocked up, almost touching the ceiling', " 'Who's there?' she snarled, in an awful voice, when she saw the children", " And they answered civilly, though they were so terrified that they hid behind one another, and said: 'Good-morning, granny; our step-mother has sent us to wait upon you, and serve you", "' 'See that you do it well, then,' growled the witch", " 'If I am pleased with you, I'll reward you; but if I am not, I'll put you in a pan and fry you in the oven--that's what I'll do with you, my pretty dears! You have been gently reared, but you'll find my work hard enough", " See if you don't", "' And, so saying, she set the girl down to spin yarn, and she gave the boy a sieve in which to carry water from the well, and she herself went out into the wood", " Now, as the girl was sitting at her distaff, weeping bitterly because she could not spin, she heard the sound of hundreds of little feet, and from every hole and corner in the hut mice came pattering along the floor, squeaking and saying:      'Little girl, why are your eyes so red?      If you want help, then give us some bread", "' And the girl gave them the bread that her grandmother had given her", ' Then the mice told her that the witch had a cat, and the cat was very fond of ham; if she would give the cat her ham, it would show her the way out of the wood, and in the meantime they would spin the yarn for her  So the girl set out to look for the cat, and, as she was hunting about, she met her brother, in great trouble because he could not carry water from the well in a sieve, as it came pouring out as fast as he put it in  And as she was trying to comfort him they heard a rustling of wings, and a flight of wrens alighted on the ground beside them', " And the wrens said:      'Give us some crumbs, then you need not grieve", "      For you'll find that water will stay in the sieve", "' Then the twins crumbled their bread on the ground, and the wrens pecked it, and chirruped and chirped", ' And when they had eaten the last crumb they told the boy to fill up the holes of the sieve with clay, and then to draw water from the well  So he did what they said, and carried the sieve full of water into the hut without spilling a drop  When they entered the hut the cat was curled up on the floor  Long time ago there lived a King who had three sons; the eldest was called Szabo, the second Warza, and the youngest Iwanich  One beautiful spring morning the King was walking through his gardens with these three sons, gazing with admiration at the various fruit-trees, some of which were a mass of blossom, whilst others were bowed to the ground laden with rich fruit  During their wanderings they came unperceived on a piece of waste land where three splendid trees grew  The King looked on them for a moment, and then, shaking his head sadly, he passed on in silence', " The sons, who could not understand why he did this, asked him the reason of his dejection, and the King told them as follows: 'These three trees, which I cannot see without sorrow, were planted by me on this spot when I was a youth of twenty", ' A celebrated magician, who had given the seed to my father, promised him that they would grow into the three finest trees the world had ever seen  My father did not live to see his words come true; but on his death-bed he bade me transplant them here, and to look after them with the greatest care, which I accordingly did  At last, after the lapse of five long years, I noticed some blossoms on the branches, and a few days later the most exquisite fruit my eyes had ever seen', " 'I gave my head-gardener the strictest orders to watch the trees carefully, for the magician had warned my father that if one unripe fruit were plucked from the tree, all the rest would become rotten at once", ' When it was quite ripe the fruit would become a golden yellow', " 'Every day I gazed on the lovely fruit, which became gradually more and more tempting-looking, and it was all I could do not to break the magician's commands", " 'One night I dreamt that the fruit was perfectly ripe; I ate some of it, and it was more delicious than anything I had ever tasted in real life", ' As soon as I awoke I sent for the gardener and asked him if the fruit on the three trees had not ripened in the night to perfection', " 'But instead of replying, the gardener threw himself at my feet and swore that he was innocent", ' He said that he had watched by the trees all night, but in spite of it, and as if by magic, the beautiful trees had been robbed of all their fruit', " 'Grieved as I was over the theft, I did not punish the gardener, of whose fidelity I was well assured, but I determined to pluck off all the fruit in the following year before it was ripe, as I had not much belief in the magician's warning", " 'I carried out my intention, and had all the fruit picked off the tree, but when I tasted one of the apples it was bitter and unpleasant, and the next morning the rest of the fruit had all rotted away", " 'After this I had the beautiful fruit of these trees carefully guarded by my most faithful servants; but every year, on this very night, the fruit was plucked and stolen by an invisible hand, and next morning not a single apple remained on the trees", ' For some time past I have given up even having the trees watched', "' When the King had finished his story, Szabo, his eldest son, said to him: 'Forgive me, father, if I say I think you are mistaken", ' I am sure there are many men in your kingdom who could protect these trees from the cunning arts of a thieving magician; I myself, who as your eldest son claim the first right to do so, will mount guard over the fruit this very night', "' The King consented, and as soon as evening drew on Szabo climbed up on to one of the trees, determined to protect the fruit even if it cost him his life", ' So he kept watch half the night; but a little after midnight he was overcome by an irresistible drowsiness, and fell fast asleep  He did not awake till it was bright daylight, and all the fruit on the trees had vanished  The following year Warza, the second brother, tried his luck, but with the same result  Then it came to the turn of the third and youngest son  Iwanich was not the least discouraged by the failure of his elder brothers, though they were both much older and stronger than he was, and when night came climbed up the tree as they had done, The moon had risen, and with her soft light lit up the whole neighbourhood, so that the observant Prince could distinguish the smallest object distinctly  At midnight a gentle west wind shook the tree, and at the same moment a snow-white swan-like bird sank down gently on his breast', " The Prince hastily seized the bird's wings in his hands, when, lo! to his astonishment he found he was holding in his arms not a bird but the most beautiful girl he had ever seen", " 'You need not fear Militza,' said the beautiful girl, looking at the Prince with friendly eyes" ,  ' There were once a King and a Queen, and they had a son called Sigurd, who was very strong and active, and good-looking  When the King came to be bowed down with the weight of years he spoke to his son, and said that now it was time for him to look out for a fitting match for himself, for he did not know how long he might last now, and he would like to see him married before he died  Sigurd was not averse to this, and asked his father where he thought it best to look for a wife  The King answered that in a certain country there was a King who had a beautiful daughter, and he thought it would be most desirable if Sigurd could get her  So the two parted, and Sigurd prepared for the journey, and went to where his father had directed him', " He came to the King and asked his daughter's hand, which he readily granted him, but only on the condition that he should remain there as long as he could, for the King himself was not strong and not very able to govern his kingdom", " Sigurd accepted this condition, but added that he would have to get leave to go home again to his own country when he heard news of his father's death", ' After that Sigurd married the Princess, and helped his father-in-law to govern the kingdom  He and the Princess loved each other dearly, and after a year a son came to them, who was two years old when word came to Sigurd that his father was dead  Sigurd now prepared to return home with his wife and child, and went on board ship to go by sea', " They had sailed for several days, when the breeze suddenly fell, and there came a dead calm, at a time when they needed only one day's voyage to reach home", ' Sigurd and his Queen were one day on deck, when most of the others on the ship had fallen asleep  There they sat and talked for a while, and had their little son along with them  After a time Sigurd became so heavy with sleep that he could no longer keep awake, so he went below and lay down, leaving the Queen alone on the deck, playing with her son  A good while after Sigurd had gone below the Queen saw something black on the sea, which seemed to be coming nearer  As it approached she could make out that it was a boat, and could see the figure of some one sitting in it and rowing it  At last the boat came alongside the ship, and now the Queen saw that it was a stone boat, out of which there came up on board the ship a fearfully ugly Witch  The Queen was more frightened than words can describe, and could neither speak a word nor move from the place so as to awaken the King or the sailors  The Witch came right up to the Queen, took the child from her and laid it on the deck; then she took the Queen, and stripped her of all her fine clothes, which she proceeded to put on herself, and looked then like a human being', " Last of all she took the Queen, put her into the boat, and said-- 'This spell I lay upon you, that you slacken not your course until you come to my brother in the Underworld", "' The Queen sat stunned and motionless, but the boat at once shot away from the ship with her, and before long she was out of sight", ' When the boat could no longer be seen the child began to cry, and though the Witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it; so she went below to where the King was sleeping with the child on her arm, and awakened him, scolding him for leaving them alone on deck, while he and all the crew were asleep  It was great carelessness of him, she said, to leave no one to watch the ship with her  Sigurd was greatly surprised to hear his Queen scold him so much, for she had never said an angry word to him before; but he thought it was quite excusable in this case, and tried to quiet the child along with her, but it was no use  Then he went and wakened the sailors, and bade them hoist the sails, for a breeze had sprung up and was blowing straight towards the harbour', " They soon reached the land which Sigurd was to rule over, and found all the people sorrowful for the old King's death, but they became glad when they got Sigurd back to the Court, and made him King over them", " The King's son, however, hardly ever stopped crying from the time he had been taken from his mother on the deck of the ship, although he had always been such a good child before, so that at last the King had to get a nurse for him--one of the maids of the Court", ' As soon as the child got into her charge he stopped crying, and behaved well as before  After the sea-voyage it seemed to the King that the Queen had altered very much in many ways, and not for the better  He thought her much more haughty and stubborn and difficult to deal with than she used to be  In very ancient times there lived a King, whose power lay not only in the vast extent of his dominions, but also in the magic secrets of which he was master  After spending the greater part of his early youth in pleasure, he met a Princess of such remarkable beauty that he at once asked her hand in marriage, and, having obtained it, considered himself the happiest of men', " After a year's time a son was born, worthy in every way of such distinguished parents, and much admired by the whole Court", ' As soon as the Queen thought him strong enough for a journey she set out with him secretly to visit her Fairy godmother', " I said secretly, because the Fairy had warned the Queen that the King was a magician; and as from time immemorial there had been a standing feud between the Fairies and the Wizards, he might not have approved of his wife's visit", " The Fairy godmother, who took the deepest interest in all the Queen's concerns, and who was much pleased with the little Prince, endowed him with the power of pleasing everybody from his cradle, as well as with a wonderful ease in learning everything which could help to make him a perfectly accomplished Prince", " Accordingly, to the delight of his teachers, he made the most rapid progress in his education, constantly surpassing everyone's expectations", ' Before he was many years old, however, he had the great sorrow of losing his mother, whose last words were to advise him never to undertake anything of importance without consulting the Fairy under whose protection she had placed him', " The Prince's grief at the death of his mother was great, but it was nothing compared to that of the King, his father, who was quite inconsolable for the loss of his dear wife", ' Neither time nor reason seemed to lighten his sorrow, and the sight of all the familiar faces and things about him only served to remind him of his loss  He therefore resolved to travel for change, and by means of his magic art was able to visit every country he came to see under different shapes, returning every few weeks to the place where he had left a few followers  Having travelled from land to land in this fashion without finding anything to rivet his attention, it occurred to him to take the form of an eagle, and in this shape he flew across many countries and arrived at length in a new and lovely spot, where the air seemed filled with the scent of jessamine and orange flowers with which the ground was thickly planted  Attracted by the sweet perfume he flew lower, and perceived some large and beautiful gardens filled with the rarest flowers, and with fountains throwing up their clear waters into the air in a hundred different shapes  A wide stream flowed through the garden, and on it floated richly ornamented barges and gondolas filled with people dressed in the most elegant manner and covered with jewels  In one of these barges sat the Queen of that country with her only daughter, a maiden more beautiful than the Day Star, and attended by the ladies of the Court', " No more exquisitely lovely mortal was ever seen than this Princess, and it needed all an eagle's strength of sight to prevent the King being hopelessly dazzled", " He perched on the top of a large orange tree, whence he was able to survey the scene and to gaze at pleasure on the Princess's charms", " Now, an eagle with a King's heart in his breast is apt to be bold, and accordingly he instantly made up his mind to carry off the lovely damsel, feeling sure that having once seen her he could not live without her", ' He waited till he saw her in the act of stepping ashore, when, suddenly swooping down, he carried her off before her equerry in attendance had advanced to offer her his hand', " The Princess, on finding herself in an eagle's talons, uttered the most heart-breaking shrieks and cries; but her captor, though touched by her distress, would not abandon his lovely prey, and continued to fly through the air too fast to allow of his saying anything to comfort her", ' At length, when he thought they had reached a safe distance, he began to lower his flight, and gradually descending to earth, deposited his burden in a flowery meadow  He then entreated her pardon for his violence, and told her that he was about to carry her to a great kingdom over which he ruled, and where he desired she should rule with him, adding many tender and consoling expressions  For some time the Princess remained speechless; but recovering herself a little, she burst into a flood of tears', " The King, much moved, said, 'Adorable Princess, dry your tears", ' I implore you  My only wish is to make you the happiest person in the world', "' 'If you speak truth, my lord,' replied the Princess, 'restore to me the liberty you have deprived me of", ' Otherwise I can only look on you as my worst enemy', "' The King retorted that her opposition filled him with despair, but that he hoped to carry her to a place where all around would respect her, and where every pleasure would surround her", ' So saying, he seized her once more, and in spite of all her cries he rapidly bore her off to the neighbourhood of his capital  A mouse, a rat, and a little red hen once lived together in the same cottage, and one day the little red hen said, "Let us bake a cake and have a feast " "Let us," says the mouse, and "let us," says the rat  "Who\'ll go and get the wheat ground?" says the hen  "I won\'t," says the mouse; "I won\'t," says the rat  "I will myself," says the little red hen  "Who\'ll make the cake?" "I won\'t," says the mouse; "I will," says the rat  "Indeed, you shall not," says the little red hen  Well, while the hen was stretching her hand out for it--"Hey Presto!" out rolled the cake from the cottage, and after it ran the mouse, the rat, and the little red hen  When it was running away it went by a barn full of threshers, and they asked it where it was running  "Oh," says it, "I\'m running away from the mouse, the rat, and the little red hen, and from you, too, if I can " So they rushed away after it with their flails, and it ran, and it ran till it came to a ditch full of ditchers, and they asked it where it was running  "Oh, I am running away from the mouse, the rat, and the little red hen, and from a barn full of threshers, and from you, too, if I can " Well, they all ran after it along with the rest, till it came to a well full of washers, and they asked the same question, and it returned the same answer, and after it they went  At last it came to a ford where it met with a fox, and he asked where it was running  "Oh, I\'m running away from the mouse, the rat, and the little red hen, from a barn full of threshers, a ditch full of ditchers, a well full of washers, and from you, too, if I can " "But you can\'t cross the ford," says the fox  "And can\'t you carry me over?" says the cake  "What\'ll you give me?" says the fox  "A kiss at Christmas and an egg at Easter," says the cake  "Very well," says the fox--"up with you " So he sat on his haunches with his nose in the air, and the cake got up by his tail till it sat on his crupper  "Now, over with you," says the cake  "You\'re not high enough," says the fox  Then it scrambled up on his shoulder  "Up higher still," says he; "you wouldn\'t be safe there " "Am I right now?" says he  "You\'ll be safer on the ridge pole of my nose " "Well," says the cake, "I think I can go no further " "Oh, yes," says he, and he shot it up in the air, caught it in his mouth, and sent it down the Red Lane  And that was the end of the cake  Not many years ago there lived on a stony, barren New England farm a man and his wife  They were sober, honest people, working hard from early morning until dark to enable them to secure a scanty living from their poor land  Their house, a small, one-storied building, stood upon the side of a steep hill, and the stones lay so thickly about it that scarce anything green could grow from the ground  At the foot of the hill, a quarter of a mile from the house by the winding path, was a small brook, and the woman was obliged to go there for water and to carry it up the hill to the house  This was a tedious task, and with the other hard work that fell to her share had made her gaunt and bent and lean  Yet she never complained, but meekly and faithfully performed her duties, doing the housework, carrying the water and helping her husband hoe the scanty crop that grew upon the best part of their land  One day, as she walked down the path to the brook, her big shoes scattering the pebbles right and left, she noticed a large beetle lying upon its back and struggling hard with its little legs to turn over, that its feet might again touch the ground  But this it could not accomplish; so the woman, who had a kind heart, reached down and gently turned the beetle with her finger  At once it scampered from the path and she went on to the brook  The next day, as she came for water, she was surprised to see the beetle again lying upon its back and struggling helplessly to turn  Once more the woman stopped and set him upon his feet; and then, as she stooped over the tiny creature, she heard a small voice say: "Oh, thank you! Thank you so much for saving me!" Half frightened at hearing a beetle speak in her own language, the woman started back and exclaimed: "La sakes! Surely you can\'t talk like humans!" Then, recovering from her alarm, she again bent over the beetle, who answered her: "Why shouldn\'t I talk, if I have anything to say? "\'Cause you\'re a bug," replied the woman  "That is true; and you saved my life--saved me from my enemies, the sparrows  And this is the second time you have come to my assistance, so I owe you a debt of gratitude  Bugs value their lives as much as human beings, and I am a more important creature than you, in your ignorance, may suppose  But, tell me, why do you come each day to the brook?" "For water," she answered, staring stupidly down at the talking beetle  "Isn\'t it hard work?" the creature inquired  "Yes; but there\'s no water on the hill," said she  "Then dig a well and put a pump in it," replied the beetle  She shook her head  "My man tried it once; but there was no water," she said, sadly  "Try it again," commanded the beetle; "and in return for your kindness to me I will make this promise: if you do not get water from the well you will get that which is more precious to you  I must go now  Do not forget  Dig a well " And then, without pausing to say good-by, it ran swiftly away and was lost among the stones  The woman returned to the house much perplexed by what the beetle had said, and when her husband came in from his work she told him the whole story  The poor man thought deeply for a time, and then declared: "Wife, there may be truth in what the bug told you  There must be magic in the world yet, if a beetle can speak; and if there is such a thing as magic we may get water from the well', " The pump I bought to use in the well which proved to be dry is now lying in the barn, and the only expense in following the talking bug's advice will be the labor of digging the hole", ' Labor I am used to; so I will dig the well' ,  " Maurice Connor was the king, and that's no small word, of all the pipers in Munster", " He could play jig and reel without end, and Ollistrum's March, and the Eagle's Whistle, and the Hen's Concert, and odd tunes of every sort and kind", ' But he knew one far more surprising than the rest, which had in it the power to set everything dead or alive dancing  In what way he learned it is beyond my knowledge for he was mighty cautious about telling how he came by so wonderful a tune  At the very first note of that tune the shoes began shaking upon the feet of all how heard it--old or young, it mattered not--just as if the shoes had the ague; then the feet began going, going, going from under them, and at last up and away with them, dancing like mad, whisking here, there, and everywhere, like a straw in a storm--there was no halting while the music lasted', " Not a fair, nor a wedding, nor a feast in the seven parishes round, was counted worth the speaking of without 'blind Maurice and his pipes", "' His mother, poor woman, used to lead him about from one place to another just like a dog", ' Down through Iveragh, Maurice Connor and his mother were taking their rounds  Beyond all other places Iveragh is the place for stormy coasts and steep mountains, as proper a spot it is as any in Ireland to get yourself drowned, or your neck broken on the land, should you prefer that', " But, notwithstanding, in Ballinskellig Bay there is a neat bit of ground, well fitted for diversion, and down from it, towards the water, is a clean smooth piece of strand, the dead image of a calm summer's sea on a moonlight night, with just the curl of the small waves upon it", " Here is was that Maurice's music had brought from all parts a great gathering of the young men and the young women; for 'twas not every day the strand of Trafraska was stirred up by the voice of a bagpipe", ' The dance began; and as pretty a dance it was as ever was danced', " 'Brave music,' said everybody, 'and well done,' when Maurice stopped", " 'More power to your elbow, Maurice, and a fair wind in the bellows,' cried Paddy Dorman, a hump-backed dancing master, who was there to keep order", " ''Tis a pity,' said he, 'if we'd let the piper run dry after such music; 'twould be a disgrace to Iveragh, that didn't come on it since the week of the three Sundays", "' So, as well became him, for he was always a decent man, says he, 'Did you drink, piper?' 'I will, sir,' said Maurice, answering the question on the safe side, for you never yet knew piper or schoolmaster who refused his drink", " 'What will you drink, Maurice?' says Paddy", " 'I'm no ways particular,' says Maurice; 'I drink anything, barring raw water; but if it's all the same to you, Mister Dorman, may be you wouldn't lend me the loan of a glass of whisky", "' 'I've no glass, Maurice,' said Paddy; 'I've only the bottle", "' 'Let that be no hindrance,' answered Maurice; 'my mouth just holds a glass to the drop; often I've tried it sure", "' So Paddy Dorman trusted him with the bottle--more fool was he; and, to his cost, he found that though Maurice's mouth might not hold more than the glass at one time, yet, owing to the hole in his throat, it took many a filling", " 'That was no bad whisky neither,' says Maurice, handing back the empty bottle", " 'By the holy frost, then!' says Paddy, ''tis but cold comfort there's in that bottle now; and 'tis your word we must take for the strength of the whisky, for you've left us no sample to judge by'; and to be sure Maurice had not", ' Now I need not tell any gentleman or lady that if he or she was to drink an honest bottle of whisky at one pull, it is not at all the same thing as drinking a bottle of water; and in the whole course of my life I never knew more than five men who could do so without being the worse  Of these Maurice Connor was not one, though he had a stiff head enough of his own', " Don't think I blame him for it; but true is the word that says, 'When liquor's in sense is out'; and puff, at a breath, out he blasted his wonderful tune", " 'Twas really then beyond all belief or telling the dancing", ' Maurice himself could not keep quiet; staggering now on one leg, now on the other, and rolling about like a ship in a cross sea, trying to humour the tune  There was his mother, too, moving her old bones as light as the youngest girl of them all; but her dancing, no, nor the dancing of all the rest, is not worthy the speaking about to the work that was going on down upon the strand  Every inch of it covered with all manner of fish jumping and plunging about to the music, and every moment more and more would tumble in and out of the water, charmed by the wonderful tune  Shortly after the birth of Kilhuch, the son of King Kilyth, his mother died  Before her death she charged the king that he should not take a wife again until he saw a briar with two blossoms upon her grave, and the king sent every morning to see if anything were growing thereon  After many years the briar appeared, and he took to wife the widow of King Doged', " She foretold to her stepson, Kilhuch, that it was his destiny to marry a maiden named Olwen, or none other, and he, at his father's bidding, went to the court of his cousin, King Arthur, to ask as a boon the hand of the maiden", ' He rode upon a grey steed with shell-formed hoofs, having a bridle of linked gold, and a saddle also of gold  In his hand were two spears of silver, well-tempered, headed with steel, of an edge to wound the wind and cause blood to flow, and swifter than the fall of the dew-drop from the blade of reed grass upon the earth when the dew of June is at its heaviest  A gold-hilted sword was on his thigh, and the blade was of gold, having inlaid upon it a cross of the hue of the lightning of heaven  Two brindled, white-breasted greyhounds, with strong collars of rubies, sported round him, and his courser cast up four sods with its four hoofs like four swallows about his head  Upon the steed was a four-cornered cloth of purple, and an apple of gold was at each corner', " Precious gold was upon the stirrups and shoes, and the blade of grass bent not beneath them, so light was the courser's tread as he went towards the gate of King Arthur's palace", ' Arthur received him with great ceremony, and asked him to remain at the palace; but the youth replied that he came not to consume meat and drink, but to ask a boon of the king  Then said Arthur, "Since thou wilt not remain here, chieftain, thou shalt receive the boon, whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far as the wind dries and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves, and the sea encircles, and the earth extends, save only my ships and my mantle, my sword, my lance, my shield, my dagger, and Guinevere my wife " So Kilhuch craved of him the hand of Olwen, the daughter of Yspathaden Penkawr, and also asked the favour and aid of all Arthur\'s court  Then said Arthur, "O chieftain, I have never heard of the maiden of whom thou speakest, nor of her kindred, but I will gladly send messengers in search of her " And the youth said, "I will willingly grant from this night to that at the end of the year to do so " Then Arthur sent messengers to every land within his dominions to seek for the maiden; and at the end of the year Arthur\'s messengers returned without having gained any knowledge or information concerning Olwen more than on the first day  Then said Kilhuch, "Every one has received his boon, and I yet lack mine  I will depart and bear away thy honour with me " Then said Kay, "Rash chieftain! dost thou reproach Arthur? Go with us, and we will not part until thou dost either confess that the maiden exists not in the world, or until we obtain her " Thereupon Kay rose up  Kay had this peculiarity, that his breath lasted nine nights and nine days under water, and he could exist nine nights and nine days without sleep', " A wound from Kay's sword no physician could heal", ' Very subtle was Kay  When it pleased him he could render himself as tall as the highest tree in the forest  And he had another peculiarity--so great was the heat of his nature, that, when it rained hardest, whatever he carried remained dry for a handbreadth above and a handbreadth below his hand; and when his companions were coldest, it was to them as fuel with which to light their fire  And Arthur called Bedwyr, who never shrank from any enterprise upon which Kay was bound  None was equal to him in swiftness throughout this island except Arthur and Drych Ail Kibthar  And although he was one-handed, three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on the field of battle  Another property he had; his lance would produce a wound equal to those of nine opposing lances  And Arthur called to Kynthelig the guide  There was once a girl so poor that she had nothing to live on, and wandered about the world asking for charity  One day she arrived at a thatched cottage, and inquired if they could give her any work  The farmer said he wanted a cowherd, as his own had left him, and if the girl liked the place she might take it  So she became a cowherd  One morning she was driving her cows through the meadows when she heard near by a loud groan that almost sounded human  She hastened to the spot from which the noise came, and found it proceeded from a lion who lay stretched upon the ground  You can guess how frightened she was! But the lion seemed in such pain that she was sorry for him, and drew nearer and nearer till she saw he had a large thorn in one foot  She pulled out the thorn and bound up the place, and the lion was grateful, and licked her hand by way of thanks with his big rough tongue  When the girl had finished she went back to find the cows, but they had gone, and though she hunted everywhere she never found them; and she had to return home and confess to her master, who scolded her bitterly, and afterwards beat her', " Then he said, 'Now you will have to look after the asses", "' So every day she had to take the asses to the woods to feed, until one morning, exactly a year after she had found the lion, she heard a groan which sounded quite human", ' She went straight to the place from which the noise came, and, to her great surprise, beheld the same lion stretched on the ground with a deep wound across his face  This time she was not afraid at all, and ran towards him, washing the wound and laying soothing herbs upon it; and when she had bound it up the lion thanked her in the same manner as before  After that she returned to her flock, but they were nowhere to be seen  She searched here and she searched there, but they had vanished completely! Then she had to go home and confess to her master, who first scolded her and afterwards beat her', " 'Now go,' he ended, 'and look after the pigs!' So the next day she took out the pigs, and found them such good feeding grounds that they grew fatter every day", ' Another year passed by, and one morning when the maiden was out with her pigs she heard a groan which sounded quite human  She ran to see what it was, and found her old friend the lion, wounded through and through, fast dying under a tree  She fell on her knees before him and washed his wounds one by one, and laid healing herbs upon them  And the lion licked her hands and thanked her, and asked if she would not stay and sit by him  But the girl said she had her pigs to watch, and she must go and see after them  So she ran to the place where she had left them, but they had vanished as if the earth had swallowed them up  She whistled and called, but only the birds answered her  Then she sank down on the ground and wept bitterly, not daring to return home until some hours had passed away  And when she had had her cry out she got up and searched all up and down the wood  But it was no use; there was not a sign of the pigs  At last she thought that perhaps if she climbed a tree she might see further  But no sooner was she seated on the highest branch than something happened which put the pigs quite out of her head  This was a handsome young man who was coming down the path; and when he had almost reached the tree he pulled aside a rock and disappeared behind it  The maiden rubbed her eyes and wondered if she had been dreaming  Once upon a time there lived a youth who was never happy unless he was prying into something that other people knew nothing about  After he had learned to understand the language of birds and beasts, he discovered accidentally that a great deal took place under cover of night which mortal eyes never saw  From that moment he felt he could not rest till these hidden secrets were laid bare to him, and he spent his whole time wandering from one wizard to another, begging them to open his eyes, but found none to help him  At length he reached an old magician called Mana, whose learning was greater than that of the rest, and who could tell him all he wanted to know', " But when the old man had listened attentively to him, he said, warningly: 'My son, do not follow after empty knowledge, which will not bring you happiness, but rather evil", ' Much is hidden from the eyes of men, because did they know everything their hearts would no longer be at peace  Knowledge kills joy, therefore think well what you are doing, or some day you will repent  But if you will not take my advice, then truly I can show you the secrets of the night', " Only you will need more than a man's courage to bear the sight", "' He stopped and looked at the young man, who nodded his head, and then the wizard continued, 'To-morrow night you must go to the place where, once in seven years, the serpent-king gives a great feast to his whole court", " In front of him stands a golden bowl filled with goats' milk, and if you can manage to dip a piece of bread in this milk, and eat it before you are obliged to fly, you will understand all the secrets of the night that are hidden from other men", " It is lucky for you that the serpent-king's feast happens to fall this year, otherwise you would have had long to wait for it", ' But take care to be quick and bold, or it will be the worse for you', "' The young man thanked the wizard for his counsel, and went his way firmly resolved to carry out his purpose, even if he paid for it with his life; and when night came he set out for a wide, lonely moor, where the serpent-king held his feast", ' With sharpened eyes, he looked eagerly all round him, but could see nothing but a multitude of small hillocks, that lay motionless under the moonlight  He crouched behind a bush for some time, till he felt that midnight could not be far off, when suddenly there arose in the middle of the moor a brilliant glow, as if a star was shining over one of the hillocks  At the same moment all the hillocks began to writhe and to crawl, and from each one came hundreds of serpents and made straight for the glow, where they knew they should find their king  When they reached the hillock where he dwelt, which was higher and broader than the rest, and had a bright light hanging over the top, they coiled themselves up and waited  The whirr and confusion from all the serpent-houses were so great that the youth did not dare to advance one step, but remained where he was, watching intently all that went on; but at last he began to take courage, and moved on softly step by step  What he saw was creepier than creepy, and surpassed all he had ever dreamt of  Thousands of snakes, big and little and of every colour, were gathered together in one great cluster round a huge serpent, whose body was as thick as a beam, and which had on its head a golden crown, from which the light sprang  Their hissings and darting tongues so terrified the young man that his heart sank, and he felt he should never have courage to push on to certain death, when suddenly he caught sight of the golden bowl in front of the serpent-king, and knew that if he lost this chance it would never come back  So, with his hair standing on end and his blood frozen in his veins, he crept forwards  Oh! what a noise and a whirr rose afresh among the serpents  Thousands of heads were reared, and tongues were stretched out to sting the intruder to death, but happily for him their bodies were so closely entwined one in the other that they could not disentangle themselves quickly  Like lightning he seized a bit of bread, dipped it in the bowl, and put it in his mouth, then dashed away as if fire was pursuing him  On he flew as if a whole army of foes were at his heels, and he seemed to hear the noise of their approach growing nearer and nearer  At length his breath failed him, and he threw himself almost senseless on the turf  While he lay there dreadful dreams haunted him  He thought that the serpent-king with the fiery crown had twined himself round him, and was crushing out his life  After a very short time the pleasant easy life I led made me quite forget the perils of my two voyages  Moreover, as I was still in the prime of life, it pleased me better to be up and doing  So once more providing myself with the rarest and choicest merchandise of Bagdad, I conveyed it to Balsora, and set sail with other merchants of my acquaintance for distant lands  We had touched at many ports and made much profit, when one day upon the open sea we were caught by a terrible wind which blew us completely out of our reckoning, and lasting for several days finally drove us into harbour on a strange island  "I would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here," quoth our captain  "This island and all adjoining it are inhabited by hairy savages, who are certain to attack us, and whatever these dwarfs may do we dare not resist, since they swarm like locusts, and if one of them is killed the rest will fall upon us, and speedily make an end of us " These words caused great consternation among all the ship\'s company, and only too soon we were to find out that the captain spoke truly  There appeared a vast multitude of hideous savages, not more than two feet high and covered with reddish fur  Throwing themselves into the waves they surrounded our vessel', " Chattering meanwhile in a language we could not understand, and clutching at ropes and gangways, they swarmed up the ship's side with such speed and agility that they almost seemed to fly", ' You may imagine the rage and terror that seized us as we watched them, neither daring to hinder them nor able to speak a word to deter them from their purpose, whatever it might be  Of this we were not left long in doubt  Hoisting the sails, and cutting the cable of the anchor, they sailed our vessel to an island which lay a little further off, where they drove us ashore; then taking possession of her, they made off to the place from which they had come, leaving us helpless upon a shore avoided with horror by all mariners for a reason which you will soon learn  Turning away from the sea we wandered miserably inland, finding as we went various herbs and fruits which we ate, feeling that we might as well live as long as possible though we had no hope of escape  Presently we saw in the far distance what seemed to us to be a splendid palace, towards which we turned our weary steps, but when we reached it we saw that it was a castle, lofty, and strongly built  Pushing back the heavy ebony doors we entered the courtyard, but upon the threshold of the great hall beyond it we paused, frozen with horror, at the sight which greeted us  On one side lay a huge pile of bones--human bones, and on the other numberless spits for roasting! Overcome with despair we sank trembling to the ground, and lay there without speech or motion  The sun was setting when a loud noise aroused us, the door of the hall was violently burst open and a horrible giant entered  He was as tall as a palm tree, and perfectly black, and had one eye, which flamed like a burning coal in the middle of his forehead', " His teeth were long and sharp and grinned horribly, while his lower lip hung down upon his chest, and he had ears like elephant's ears, which covered his shoulders, and nails like the claws of some fierce bird", ' At this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead men  When at last we came to ourselves the giant sat examining us attentively with his fearful eye  Presently when he had looked at us enough he came towards us, and stretching out his hand took me by the back of the neck, turning me this way and that, but feeling that I was mere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to the next, whom he treated in the same fashion; at last he came to the captain, and finding him the fattest of us all, he took him up in one hand and stuck him upon a spit and proceeded to kindle a huge fire at which he presently roasted him  After the giant had supped he lay down to sleep, snoring like the loudest thunder, while we lay shivering with horror the whole night through, and when day broke he awoke and went out, leaving us in the castle  When we believed him to be really gone we started up bemoaning our horrible fate, until the hall echoed with our despairing cries  Though we were many and our enemy was alone it did not occur to us to kill him, and indeed we should have found that a hard task, even if we had thought of it, and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves  So at last, submitting to our sad fate, we spent the day in wandering up and down the island eating such fruits as we could find, and when night came we returned to the castle, having sought in vain for any other place of shelter  At sunset the giant returned, supped upon one of our unhappy comrades, slept and snored till dawn, and then left us as before  Our condition seemed to us so frightful that several of my companions thought it would be better to leap from the cliffs and perish in the waves at once, rather than await so miserable an end; but I had a plan of escape which I now unfolded to them, and which they at once agreed to attempt  "Listen, my brothers," I added  There was once a woman who wanted to have quite a tiny, little child, but she did not know where to get one from', " So one day she went to an old Witch and said to her: 'I should so much like to have a tiny, little child; can you tell me where I can get one?' 'Oh, we have just got one ready!' said the Witch", " 'Here is a barley-corn for you, but it's not the kind the farmer sows in his field, or feeds the cocks and hens with, I can tell you", ' Put it in a flower-pot, and then you will see something happen', "' 'Oh, thank you!' said the woman, and gave the Witch a shilling, for that was what it cost", ' Then she went home and planted the barley-corn; immediately there grew out of it a large and beautiful flower, which looked like a tulip, but the petals were tightly closed as if it were still only a bud', " 'What a beautiful flower!' exclaimed the woman, and she kissed the red and yellow petals; but as she kissed them the flower burst open", ' It was a real tulip, such as one can see any day; but in the middle of the blossom, on the green velvety petals, sat a little girl, quite tiny, trim, and pretty  She was scarcely half a thumb in height; so they called her Thumbelina  An elegant polished walnut-shell served Thumbelina as a cradle, the blue petals of a violet were her mattress, and a rose-leaf her coverlid  There she lay at night, but in the day-time she used to play about on the table; here the woman had put a bowl, surrounded by a ring of flowers, with their stalks in water, in the middle of which floated a great tulip pedal, and on this Thumbelina sat, and sailed from one side of the bowl to the other, rowing herself with two white horse-hairs for oars  It was such a pretty sight! She could sing, too, with a voice more soft and sweet than had ever been heard before  One night, when she was lying in her pretty little bed, an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window  She was very ugly, clumsy, and clammy; she hopped on to the table where Thumbelina lay asleep under the red rose-leaf', " 'This would make a beautiful wife for my son,' said the toad, taking up the walnut-shell, with Thumbelina inside, and hopping with it through the window into the garden", ' There flowed a great wide stream, with slippery and marshy banks; here the toad lived with her son', " Ugh! how ugly and clammy he was, just like his mother! 'Croak, croak, croak!' was all he could say when he saw the pretty little girl in the walnut-shell", " 'Don't talk so load, or you'll wake her,' said the old toad", " 'She might escape us even now; she is as light as a feather", ' We will put her at once on a broad water-lily leaf in the stream  That will be quite an island for her; she is so small and light', " She can't run away from us there, whilst we are preparing the guest-chamber under the marsh where she shall live", "' Outside in the brook grew many water-lilies, with broad green leaves, which looked as if they were swimming about on the water", ' The leaf farthest away was the largest, and to this the old toad swam with Thumbelina in her walnut-shell  The tiny Thumbelina woke up very early in the morning, and when she saw where she was she began to cry bitterly; for on every side of the great green leaf was water, and she could not get to the land  The old toad was down under the marsh, decorating her room with rushes and yellow marigold leaves, to make it very grand for her new daughter-in-law; then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where Thumbelina lay  She wanted to fetch the pretty cradle to put it into her room before Thumbelina herself came there', " The old toad bowed low in the water before her, and said: 'Here is my son; you shall marry him, and live in great magnificence down under the marsh", "' 'Croak, croak, croak!' was all that the son could say", ' Then they took the neat little cradle and swam away with it; but Thumbelina sat alone on the great green leaf and wept, for she did not want to live with the clammy toad, or marry her ugly son A certain tailor had a son, who happened to be small, and no bigger than a thumb, and on this account he was always called thumbling  He had, however, some courage in him, and said to his father, father, I must and will go out into the world', " That's right, my son, said the old man, and took a long darning-needle and made a knob of sealing-wax on it at the handle, and there is a sword for you to take with you on the way", ' Then the little tailor wanted to have one more meal with them, and hopped into the kitchen to see what his mother had cooked for the last time  But it was already served, and the dish stood on the hearth  Then he said, mother, what is there to eat to-day  See for yourself, said his mother  So thumbling jumped on to the hearth, and peeped into the dish, but as he stretched his neck in too far the steam from the food caught hold of him, and carried him up the chimney  He rode about in the air on the steam for a while, until at length he sank down to the ground again  Now the little tailor was outside in the wide world, and he traveled about, and went to a master in his craft, but the food was not good enough for him  Mistress, if you give us no better food, said thumbling, I will go away, and early to-morrow morning I will write with chalk on the door of your house - too many potatoes, too little meat  Farewell, mr  Potato-king  What would you have forsooth, grasshopper, said the mistress, and grew angry, and seized a dishcloth, and was just going to strike him, but my little tailor crept nimbly under a thimble, peeped out from beneath it, and put his tongue out at the mistress  She took up the thimble, and wanted to get hold of him, but little thumbling hopped into the cloth, and while the mistress was opening it out and looking for him, he got into a crevice in the table  Ho, ho, lady mistress, cried he, and thrust his head out, and when she began to strike him he leapt down into the drawer  At last, however, she caught him and drove him out of the house', " The little tailor journeyed on and came to a great forest, and there he fell in with a band of robbers who had a design to steal the king's treasure", ' When they saw the little tailor, they thought, a little fellow like that can creep through a key-hole and serve as picklock to us  HI, there, cried one of them, you giant goliath, will you go to the treasure-chamber with us  You can slip yourself in and throw out the money  Thumbling reflected a while, and at length he said, yes, and went with them to the treasure-chamber  Then he looked at the doors above and below, to see if there was any crack in them  It was not long before he espied one which was broad enough to let him in  He was therefore about to get in at once, but one of the two sentries who stood before the door, observed him, and said to the other, what an ugly spider is creeping there, I will kill it  Let the poor creature alone, said the other, it has done you no harm  Then thumbling got safely through the crevice into the treasure-chamber, opened the window beneath which the robbers were standing, and threw out to them one taler after another  When the little tailor was in the full swing of his work, he heard the king coming to inspect his treasure-chamber, and crept hastily into a hiding-place  The king noticed that several solid talers were missing, but could not conceive who could have stolen them, for locks and bolts were in good condition, and all seemed well guarded  Then he went away again, and said to the sentries, be on the watch, someone is after the money There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and spun  Then said he, how sad it is that we have no children  With us all is so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively  Yes, replied the wife, and sighed, even if we had only one, and it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be quite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts  Now it so happened that the woman fell ill, and after seven months gave birth to a child, that was perfect in all its limbs, but no longer than a thumb  Then said they, it is as we wished it to be, and it shall be our dear child  And because of its size, they called it thumbling  Though they did not let it want for food, the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had been at the first  Nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its eyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature, for everything it did turned out well  One day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood, when he said as if to himself, how I wish that there was someone who would bring the cart to me  Oh father, cried thumbling, I will soon bring the cart, rely on that  It shall be in the forest at the appointed time  The man smiled and said, how can that be done, you are far too small to lead the horse by the reins', " That's of no consequence, father, if my mother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse's ear and call out to him how he is to go", ' Well, answered the man, for once we will try it  When the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed thumbling in its ear, and then the little creature cried, gee up, gee up  Then it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart went the right way into the forest  It so happened that just as he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, gee up, two strange men came towards him  My word, said one of them, what is this  There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to the horse and still he is not to be seen', " That can't be right, said the other, we will follow the cart and see where it stops", ' The cart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut  When thumbling saw his father, he cried to him, do you see, father, here I am with the cart, now take me down  The father got hold of the horse with his left hand and with the right took his little son out of the ear  Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the two strange men saw him, they did not know what to say for astonishment  Then one of them took the other aside and said, listen, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited him in a large town, for money  We will buy him  They went to the peasant and said, sell us the little man  He shall be well treated with us  No, replied the father, he is the apple of my eye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me  There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and span  Then said he, "How sad it is that we have no children! With us all is so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively " "Yes," replied the wife, and sighed, "even if we had only one, and it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be quite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts " Now it so happened that their wish was granted and a child was given them, but although it was perfect in all its limbs, it was no longer than a thumb  Then said they, "It is as we wished it to be, and it shall be our dear child;" and because of its size, they called it Thumbling  They did not let it want for food, but the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had been at the first, nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its eyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature, for everything it did turned out well  One day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood, when he said as if to himself, "How I wish that there was any one who would bring the cart to me!" "Oh, father," cried Thumbling, "I will soon bring the cart; rely on that; it shall be in the forest at the appointed time " The man smiled and said, "How can that be done; you are far too small to lead the horse by the reins?" "That\'s of no consequence, father, if my mother will only harness it, I will sit in the horse\'s ear, and call out to him how he is to go " "Well," answered the man, "for once we will try it " When the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed Thumbling in its ear, and then the little creature cried, "Gee up, gee up!" Then it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart went the right way into the forest  It so happened that just as he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, "Gee up," two strange men came towards him  "My word!" said one of them  "What is this? There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to the horse, and still he is not to be seen!" "That can\'t be right," said the other, "we will follow the cart and see where it stops " The cart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut  When Thumbling saw his father, he cried to him, "See, father, here I am with the cart; now take me down " The father got hold of the horse with his left hand, and with the right took his little son out of the ear  Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the two strange men saw him, they did not know what to say for astonishment  Then one of them took the other aside and said, "Hark, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited him in a large town, for money  We will buy him " They went to the peasant and said, "Sell us the little man  He shall be well treated with us " "No," replied the father, "he is the apple of my eye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me " Thumbling, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up the folds of his father\'s coat, placed himself on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear  "Father, do give me away; I will soon come back again " Then the father parted with him to the two men for a handsome bit of money  "Where do you want to sit?" they said to him  "Oh, just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I can walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and still not fall down " They did as he wished, and when Thumbling had taken leave of his father, they went away with him  They walked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said, "Do take me down; I want to come down " The man took his hat off, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and he leapt and crept about a little between the sods, and then he suddenly slipped into a mouse-hole which he had sought out  Once upon a time there lived a poor man who had more children than bread to feed them with  However, they were strong and willing, and soon learned to make themselves of use to their father and mother, and when they were old enough they went out to service, and everyone was very glad to get them for servants, for they worked hard and were always cheerful  Out of all the ten or eleven, there was only one who gave his parents any trouble, and this was a big lazy boy whose name was Tiidu  Neither scoldings nor beatings nor kind words had any effect on him, and the older he grew the idler he got  He spent his winters crouching close to a warm stove, and his summers asleep under a shady tree; and if he was not doing either of these things he was playing tunes on his flute  One day he was sitting under a bush playing so sweetly that you might easily have mistaken the notes for those of a bird, when an old man passed by', " 'What trade do you wish to follow, my son?' he asked in a friendly voice, stopping as he did so in front of the youth", " 'If I were only a rich man, and had no need to work,' replied the boy, 'I should not follow any", " I could not bear to be anybody's servant, as all my brothers and sisters are", "' The old man laughed as he heard this answer, and said: 'But I do not exactly see where your riches are to come from if you do not work for them", ' Sleeping cats catch no mice', " He who wishes to become rich must use either his hands or his head, and be ready to toil night and day, or else--' But here the youth broke in rudely: 'Be silent, old man! I have been told all that a hundred times over; and it runs off me like water off a duck's back", ' No one will ever make a worker out of me', "' 'You have one gift,' replied the old man, taking no notice of this speech, 'and if you would only go about and play the pipes, you would easily earn, not only your daily bread, but a little money into the bargain", ' Listen to me; get yourself a set of pipes, and learn to play on them as well as you do on your flute, and wherever there are men to hear you, I promise you will never lack money', "' 'But where am I to get the pipes from?' asked the youth", " 'Blow on your flute for a few days,' replied the old man, 'and you will soon be able to buy your pipes", ' By-and-by I will come back again and see if you have taken my advice, and whether you are likely to grow rich', "' And so saying he went his way", ' Tiidu stayed where he was a little longer, thinking of all the old man had told him, and the more he thought the surer he felt that the old man was right  He determined to try whether his plan would really bring luck; but as he did not like being laughed at he resolved not to tell anyone a word about it  So next morning he left home--and never came back! His parents did not take his loss much to heart, but were rather glad that their useless son had for once shown a little spirit, and they hoped that time and hardship might cure Tiidu of his idle folly', " For some weeks Tiidu wandered from one village to another, and proved for himself the truth of the old man's promise", ' The people he met were all friendly and kind, and enjoyed his flute-playing, giving him his food in return, and even a few pence  These pence the youth hoarded carefully till he had collected enough to buy a beautiful pair of pipes  Then he felt himself indeed on the high road to riches  Nowhere could pipes be found as fine as his, or played in so masterly a manner', " Tiidu's pipes set everybody's legs dancing", ' Wherever there was a marriage, a christening, or a feast of any kind, Tiidu must be there, or the evening would be a failure  In a few years he had become so noted a piper that people would travel far and wide to hear him' ,  "Long, long ago there lived a king who was such a mighty monarch that whenever he sneezed every one in the whole country had to say 'To your good health!' Every one said it except the shepherd with the staring eyes, and he would not say it", ' The king heard of this and was very angry, and sent for the shepherd to appear before him  The shepherd came and stood before the throne, where the king sat looking very grand and powerful  But however grand or powerful he might be the shepherd did not feel a bit afraid of him  \'Say at once, "To my good health!"\' cried the king', " 'To my good health!' replied the shepherd", " 'To mine--to mine, you rascal, you vagabond!' stormed the king", " 'To mine, to mine, your Majesty,' was the answer", " 'But to mine--to my own,' roared the king, and beat on his breast in a rage", " 'Well, yes; to mine, of course, to my own,' cried the shepherd, and gently tapped his breast", ' The king was beside himself with fury and did not know what to do, when the Lord Chamberlain interfered: \'Say at once--say this very moment: "To your health, your Majesty"; for if you don\'t say it you\'ll lose your life, whispered he', " 'No, I won't say it till I get the princess for my wife,' was the shepherd's answer", ' Now the princess was sitting on a little throne beside the king, her father, and she looked as sweet and lovely as a little golden dove', " When she heard what the shepherd said she could not help laughing, for there is no denying the fact that this young shepherd with the staring eyes pleased her very much; indeed he pleased her better than any king's son she had yet seen", " But the king was not as pleasant as his daughter, and he gave orders to throw the shepherd into the white bear's pit", ' The guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white bear, who had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry  The door of the pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd; but when it saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself  It shrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there, and, in spite of being so famished, did not dare to touch him, but sucked its own paws from sheer hunger  The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes off the beast he was a dead man, and in order to keep himself awake he made songs and sang them, and so the night went by', " Next morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd's bones, and was amazed to find him alive and well", ' He led him to the king, who fell into a furious passion, and said: \'Well, you have learned what it is to be very near death, and now will you say "To my good health"?\' But the shepherd answered: \'I am not afraid of ten deaths! I will only say it if I may have the princess for my wife', "' 'Then go to your death,' cried the king; and ordered him to be thrown into the den with the wild boars", ' The wild boars had not been fed for a week, and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him to tear him to pieces  But the shepherd took a little flute out of the sleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune, on which the wild boars first of all shrank shyly away, and then got up on their hind legs and danced gaily  The shepherd would have given anything to be able to laugh, they looked so funny; but he dared not stop playing, for he knew well enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear him to pieces  His eyes were of no use to him here, for he could not have stared ten wild boars in the face at once; so he kept on playing, and the wild boars danced very slowly, as if in a minuet, then by degrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and turn quickly enough, and ended by all falling over each other in a heap, quite exhausted and out of breath  Then the shepherd ventured to laugh at last; and he laughed so long and so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning, expecting to find only his bones, the tears were still running down his cheeks from laughter  As soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before him; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not torn the man to bits, and he said: \'Well, you have learned what it feels to be near ten deaths, now say "To my good health!"\' But the shepherd broke in with, \'I do not fear a hundred deaths, and I will only say it if I may have the princess for my wife', "' 'Then go to a hundred deaths!' roared the king, and ordered the shepherd to be thrown down the deep vault of scythes", ' The guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon, in the middle of which was a deep well with sharp scythes all round it  Once upon a time there lived a princess who was so beautiful and so good that everybody loved her  Her father could hardly bear her out of his sight, and he almost died of grief when, one day, she disappeared, and though the whole kingdom was searched through and through, she could not be found in any corner of it  In despair, the king ordered a proclamation to be made that whoever could bring her back to the palace should have her for his wife  This made the young men start afresh on the search, but they were no more successful than before, and returned sorrowfully to their homes  Now there dwelt, not far from the palace, an old man who had three sons  The two eldest were allowed by their parents to do just as they liked, but the youngest was always obliged to give way to his brothers  When they were all grown up, the eldest told his father that he was tired of leading such a quiet life, and that he meant to go away and see the world  The old people were very unhappy at the thought that they must part with him, but they said nothing, and began to collect all that he would want for his travels, and were careful to add a pair of new boots  When everything was ready, he bade them farewell, and started merrily on his way  For some miles his road lay through a wood, and when he left it he suddenly came out on a bare hillside  Here he sat down to rest, and pulling out his wallet prepared to eat his dinner  He had only eaten a few mouthfuls when an old man badly dressed passed by, and seeing the food, asked if the young man could not spare him a little', " 'Not I, indeed!' answered he; 'why I have scarcely enough for myself", ' If you want food you must earn it', "' And the beggar went on", ' After the young man had finished his dinner he rose and walked on for several hours, till he reached a second hill, where he threw himself down on the grass, and took some bread and milk from his wallet  While he was eating and drinking, there came by an old man, yet more wretched than the first, and begged for a few mouthfuls  But instead of food he only got hard words, and limped sadly away  Towards evening the young man reached an open space in the wood, and by this time he thought he would like some supper  The birds saw the food, and flew round his head in numbers hoping for some crumbs, but he threw stones at them, and frightened them off  Then he began to wonder where he should sleep  Not in the open space he was in, for that was bare and cold, and though he had walked a long way that day, and was tired, he dragged himself up, and went on seeking for a shelter  At length he saw a deep sort of hole or cave under a great rock, and as it seemed quite empty, he went in, and lay down in a corner  About midnight he was awakened by a noise, and peeping out he beheld a terrible ogress approaching  He implored her not to hurt him, but to let him stay there for the rest of the night, to which she consented, on condition that he should spend the next day in doing any task which she might choose to set him  To this the young man willingly agreed, and turned over and went to sleep again  In the morning, the ogress bade him sweep the dust out of the cave, and to have it clean before her return in the evening, otherwise it would be the worse for him  Then she left the cave  The young man took the spade, and began to clean the floor of the cave, but try as he would to move it the dirt still stuck to its place  He soon gave up the task, and sat sulkily in the corner, wondering what punishment the ogress would find for him, and why she had set him to do such an impossible thing On one of the Danish islands, where old Thingstones, the seats of justice of our forefathers, still stand in the cornfields, and huge trees rise in the forests of beech, there lies a little town whose low houses are covered with red tiles  In one of these houses strange things were brewing over the glowing coals on the open hearth; there was a boiling going on in glasses, and a mixing and distilling, while herbs were being cut up and pounded in mortars  An elderly man looked after it all  "One must only do the right thing," he said; "yes, the right--the correct thing  One must find out the truth concerning every created particle, and keep to that " In the room with the good housewife sat her two sons; they were still small, but had great thoughts  Their mother, too, had always spoken to them of right and justice, and exhorted them to keep to the truth, which she said was the countenance of the Lord in this world  The elder of the boys looked roguish and enterprising  He took a delight in reading of the forces of nature, of the sun and the moon; no fairy tale pleased him so much  Oh, how beautiful it must be, he thought, to go on voyages of discovery, or to find out how to imitate the wings of birds and then to be able to fly! Yes, to find that out was the right thing  Father was right, and mother was right--truth holds the world together  The younger brother was quieter, and buried himself entirely in his books', " When he read about Jacob dressing himself in sheep-skins to personify Esau, and so to usurp his brother's birthright, he would clench his little fist in anger against the deceiver; when he read of tyrants and of the injustice and wickedness of the world, tears would come into his eyes, and he was quite filled with the thought of the justice and truth which must and would triumph", ' One evening he was lying in bed, but the curtains were not yet drawn close, and the light streamed in upon him; he had taken his book into bed with him, for he wanted to finish reading the story of Solon  His thoughts lifted and carried him away a wonderful distance; it seemed to him as if the bed had become a ship flying along under full sail  Was he dreaming, or what was happening? It glided over the rolling waves and across the ocean of time, and to him came the voice of Solon; spoken in a strange tongue, yet intelligible to him, he heard the Danish motto: "By law the land is ruled " The genius of the human race stood in the humble room, bent down over the bed and imprinted a kiss on the boy\'s forehead: "Be thou strong in fame and strong in the battle of life! With truth in thy heart fly toward the land of truth!" The elder brother was not yet in bed; he was standing at the window looking out at the mist which rose from the meadows  They were not elves dancing out there, as their old nurse had told him; he knew better--they were vapours which were warmer than the air, and that is why they rose', " A shooting star lit up the sky, and the boy's thoughts passed in a second from the vapours of the earth up to the shining meteor", ' The stars gleamed in the heavens, and it seemed as if long golden threads hung down from them to the earth  "Fly with me," sang a voice, which the boy heard in his heart  And the mighty genius of mankind, swifter than a bird and than an arrow--swifter than anything of earthly origin--carried him out into space, where the heavenly bodies are bound together by the rays that pass from star to star  Our earth revolved in the thin air, and the cities upon it seemed to lie close to each other  Through the spheres echoed the words: "What is near, what is far, when thou art lifted by the mighty genius of mind?" And again the boy stood by the window, gazing out, whilst his younger brother lay in bed  Their mother called them by their names: "Anders Sandoe" and "Hans Christian " Denmark and the whole world knows them--the two brothers Oersted    What a life that poor man led with his wife, to be sure! Not a day passed without her scolding him and calling him names, and indeed sometimes she would take the broom from behind the stove and beat him with it  He had no peace or comfort at all, and really hardly knew how to bear it  One day, when his wife had been particularly unkind and had beaten him black and blue, he strolled slowly into the fields, and as he could not endure to be idle he spread out his nets', " What kind of bird do you think he caught in his net? He caught a crane, and the crane said, 'Let me go free, and I'll show myself grateful", "' The man answered, 'No, my dear fellow", " I shall take you home, and then perhaps my wife won't scold me so much", "' Said the crane: 'You had better come with me to my house,' and so they went to the crane's house", " When they got there, what do you think the crane took from the wall? He took down a sack, and he said: 'Two out of a sack!' Instantly two pretty lads sprang out of the sack", ' They brought in oak tables, which they spread with silken covers, and placed all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks on them  The man had never seen anything so beautiful in his life, and he was delighted', " Then the crane said to him, 'Now take this sack to your wife", "' The man thanked him warmly, took the sack, and set out", " His home was a good long way off, and as it was growing dark, and he was feeling tired, he stopped to rest at his cousin's house by the way", " The cousin had three daughters, who laid out a tempting supper, but the man would eat nothing, and said to his cousin, 'Your supper is bad", "' 'Oh, make the best of it,' said she, but the man only said: 'Clear away!' and taking out his sack he cried, as the crane had taught him: 'Two out of the sack!' And out came the two pretty boys, who quickly brought in the oak tables, spread the silken covers, and laid out all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks", ' Never in their lives had the cousin and her daughters seen such a supper, and they were delighted and astonished at it', " But the cousin quietly made up her mind to steal the sack, so she called to her daughters: 'Go quickly and heat the bathroom: I am sure our dear guest would like to have a bath before he goes to bed", "' When the man was safe in the bathroom she told her daughters to make a sack exactly like his, as quickly as possible", " Then she changed the two sacks, and hid the man's sack away", ' The man enjoyed his bath, slept soundly, and set off early next morning, taking what he believed to be the sack the crane had given him  All the way home he felt in such good spirits that he sang and whistled as he walked through the wood, and never noticed how the birds were twittering and laughing at him', " As soon as he saw his house he began to shout from a distance, 'Hallo! old woman! Come out and meet me!' His wife screamed back: 'You come here, and I'll give you a good thrashing with the poker!' The man walked into the house, hung his sack on a nail, and said, as the crane had taught him: 'Two out of the sack!' But not a soul came out of the sack", " Then he said again, exactly as the crane had taught him: 'Two out of the sack!' His wife, hearing him chattering goodness knows what, took up her wet broom and swept the ground all about him", ' The man took flight and rushed oft into the field, and there he found the crane marching proudly about, and to him he told his tale', " 'Come back to my house,' said the crane, and so they went to the crane's house, and as soon as they got there, what did the crane take down from the wall? Why, he took down a sack, and he said: 'Two out of the sack!' And instantly two pretty lads sprang out of the sack, brought in oak tables, on which they laid silken covers, and spread all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks on them", " 'Take this sack,' said the crane", ' The man thanked him heartily, took the sack, and went', " He had a long way to walk, and as he presently got hungry, he said to the sack, as the crane had taught him: 'Two out of the sack!' And instantly two rough men with thick sticks crept out of the bag and began to beat him well, crying as they did so:  'Don't boast to your cousins of what you have got,     One--two--       Or you'll find you will catch it uncommonly hot,             One--two--' And they beat on till the man panted out: 'Two into the sack", "' The words were hardly out of his mouth, when the two crept back into the sack", " Then the man shouldered the sack, and went off straight to his cousin's house" ,  'Have you ever seen a maiden? I mean what our pavers call a maiden, a thing with which they ram down the paving-stones in the roads  A maiden of this kind is made altogether of wood, broad below, and girt round with iron rings  At the top she is narrow, and has a stick passed across through her waist, and this stick forms the arms of the maiden  In the shed stood two Maidens of this kind  They had their place among shovels, hand-carts, wheelbarrows, and measuring-tapes; and to all this company the news had come that the Maidens were no longer to be called "maidens," but "hand-rammers," which word was the newest and the only correct designation among the pavers for the thing we all know from the old times by the name of "the maiden " Now, there are among us human creatures certain individuals who are known as "emancipated women," as, for instance, principals of institutions, dancers who stand professionally on one leg, milliners, and sick-nurses; and with this class of emancipated women the two Maidens in the shed associated themselves  They were "maidens" among the paver folk, and determined not to give up this honorable appellation, and let themselves be miscalled "rammers  "Maiden is a human name, but hand-rammer is a thing, and we won\'t be called things--that\'s insulting us " "My lover would be ready to give up his engagement," said the youngest, who was betrothed to a paver\'s hammer; and the hammer is the thing which drives great piles into the earth, like a machine, and therefore does on a large scale what ten maidens effect in a similar way  "He wants to marry me as a maiden, but whether he would have me were I a hand-rammer is a question, so I won\'t have my name changed " "And I," said the elder one, "would rather have both my arms broken off " But the Wheelbarrow was of a different opinion; and the Wheelbarrow was looked upon as of some consequence, for he considered himself a quarter of a coach, because he went about upon one wheel  "I must submit to your notice," he said, "that the name \'maiden\' is common enough, and not nearly so refined as \'hand-rammer,\' or \'stamper,\' which latter has also been proposed, and through which you would be introduced into the category of seals; and only think of the great stamp of state, which impresses the royal seal that gives effect to the laws! No, in your case I would surrender my maiden name " "No, certainly not!" exclaimed the elder  "I am too old for that " "I presume you have never heard of what is called \'European necessity?\'" observed the honest Measuring Tape  "One must be able to adapt one\'s self to time and circumstances, and if there is a law that the \'maiden\' is to be called \'hand-rammer,\' why, she must be called \'hand-rammer,\' and no pouting will avail, for everything has its measure " "No; if there must be a change," said the younger, "I should prefer to be called \'Missy,\' for that reminds one a little of maidens " "But I would rather be chopped to chips," said the elder  At last they all went to work  The Maidens rode--that is, they were put in a wheelbarrow, and that was a distinction; but still they were called "hand-rammers " "Mai--!" they said, as they were bumped upon the pavement  "Mai--!" and they were very nearly pronouncing the whole word "maiden;" but they broke off short, and swallowed the last syllable; for after mature deliberation they considered it beneath their dignity to protest  But they always called each other "maiden," and praised the good old days in which everything had been called by its right name, and those who were maidens were called maidens  And they remained as they were; for the hammer really broke off his engagement with the younger one, for nothing would suit him but he must have a maiden for his bride     The region round the little town of Kjoge is very bleak and cold  The town lies on the sea shore, which is always beautiful; but here it might be more beautiful than it is, for on every side the fields are flat, and it is a long way to the forest  But when persons reside in a place and get used to it, they can always find something beautiful in it,--something for which they long, even in the most charming spot in the world which is not home  It must be owned that there are in the outskirts of the town some humble gardens on the banks of a little stream that runs on towards the sea, and in summer these gardens look very pretty  Such indeed was the opinion of two little children, whose parents were neighbors, and who played in these gardens, and forced their way from one garden to the other through the gooseberry-bushes that divided them  In one of the gardens grew an elder-tree, and in the other an old willow, under which the children were very fond of playing  They had permission to do so, although the tree stood close by the stream, and they might easily have fallen into the water; but the eye of God watches over the little ones, otherwise they would never be safe  At the same time, these children were very careful not to go too near the water; indeed, the boy was so afraid of it, that in the summer, while the other children were splashing about in the sea, nothing could entice him to join them  They jeered and laughed at him, and he was obliged to bear it all as patiently as he could', " Once the neighbor's little girl, Joanna, dreamed that she was sailing in a boat, and the boy--Knud was his name--waded out in the water to join her, and the water came up to his neck, and at last closed over his head, and in a moment he had disappeared", " When little Knud heard this dream, it seemed as if he could not bear the mocking and jeering again; how could he dare to go into the water now, after Joanna's dream! He never would do it, for this dream always satisfied him", ' The parents of these children, who were poor, often sat together while Knud and Joanna played in the gardens or in the road  Along this road--a row of willow-trees had been planted to separate it from a ditch on one side of it  They were not very handsome trees, for the tops had been cut off; however, they were intended for use, and not for show  The old willow-tree in the garden was much handsomer, and therefore the children were very fond of sitting under it  The town had a large market-place; and at the fair-time there would be whole rows, like streets, of tents and booths containing silks and ribbons, and toys and cakes, and everything that could be wished for', " There were crowds of people, and sometimes the weather would be rainy, and splash with moisture the woollen jackets of the peasants; but it did not destroy the beautiful fragrance of the honey-cakes and gingerbread with which one booth was filled; and the best of it was, that the man who sold these cakes always lodged during the fair-time with little Knud's parents", ' So every now and then he had a present of gingerbread, and of course Joanna always had a share  And, more delightful still, the gingerbread seller knew all sorts of things to tell and could even relate stories about his own gingerbread  So one evening he told them a story that made such a deep impression on the children that they never forgot it; and therefore I think we may as well hear it too, for it is not very long  "Once upon a time," said he, "there lay on my counter two gingerbread cakes, one in the shape of a man wearing a hat, the other of a maiden without a bonnet  Their faces were on the side that was uppermost, for on the other side they looked very different  Most people have a best side to their characters, which they take care to show to the world  On the left, just where the heart is, the gingerbread man had an almond stuck in to represent it, but the maiden was honey cake all over  They were placed on the counter as samples, and after lying there a long time they at last fell in love with each other; but neither of them spoke of it to the other, as they should have done if they expected anything to follow', " 'He is a man, he ought to speak the first word,' thought the gingerbread maiden; but she felt quite happy--she was sure that her love was returned", ' But his thoughts were far more ambitious, as the thoughts of a man often are  He dreamed that he was a real street boy, that he possessed four real pennies, and that he had bought the gingerbread lady, and ate her up  And so they lay on the counter for days and weeks, till they grew hard and dry; but the thoughts of the maiden became ever more tender and womanly', " 'Ah well, it is enough for me that I have been able to live on the same counter with him,' said she one day; when suddenly, 'crack,' and she broke in two" ,  ' ONCE upon a time there lived in the village of Montignies-sur-Roc a little cow-boy, without either father or mother  His real name was Michael, but he was always called the Star Gazer, because when he drove his cows over the commons to seek for pasture, he went along with his head in the air, gaping at nothing', " As he had a white skin, blue eyes, and hair that curled all over his head, the village girls used to cry after him, 'Well, Star Gazer, what are you doing?' and Michael would answer, 'Oh, nothing,' and go on his way without even turning to look at them", ' The fact was he thought them very ugly, with their sun-burnt necks, their great red hands, their coarse petticoats and their wooden shoes  He had heard that somewhere in the world there were girls whose necks were white and whose hands were small, who were always dressed in the finest silks and laces, and were called princesses, and while his companions round the fire saw nothing in the flames but common everyday fancies, he dreamed that he had the happiness to marry a princess  One morning about the middle of August, just at mid-day when the sun was hottest, Michael ate his dinner of a piece of dry bread, and went to sleep under an oak', " And while he slept he dreamt that there appeared before him a beautiful lady, dressed in a robe of cloth of gold, who said to him: 'Go to the castle of Beloeil, and there you shall marry a princess", "' That evening the little cow-boy, who had been thinking a great deal about the advice of the lady in the golden dress, told his dream to the farm people", ' But, as was natural, they only laughed at the Star Gazer  The next day at the same hour he went to sleep again under the same tree', " The lady appeared to him a second time, and said: 'Go to the castle of Beloeil, and you shall marry a princess", "' In the evening Michael told his friends that he had dreamed the same dream again, but they only laughed at him more than before", " 'Never mind,' he thought to himself; 'if the lady appears to me a third time, I will do as she tells me", "' The following day, to the great astonishment of all the village, about two o'clock in the afternoon a voice was heard singing: 'Raleo, raleo, How the cattle go!' It was the little cow-boy driving his herd back to the byre", " The farmer began to scold him furiously, but he answered quietly, 'I am going away,' made his clothes into a bundle, said good-bye to all his friends, and boldly set out to seek his fortunes", ' There was great excitement through all the village, and on the top of the hill the people stood holding their sides with laughing, as they watched the Star Gazer trudging bravely along the valley with his bundle at the end of his stick  It was enough to make anyone laugh, certainly  It was well known for full twenty miles round that there lived in the castle of Beloeil twelve princesses of wonderful beauty, and as proud as they were beautiful, and who were besides so very sensitive and of such truly royal blood, that they would have felt at once the presence of a pea in their beds, even if the mattresses had been laid over it  It was whispered about that they led exactly the lives that princesses ought to lead, sleeping far into the morning, and never getting up till mid-day  They had twelve beds all in the same room, but what was very extraordinary was the fact that though they were locked in by triple bolts, every morning their satin shoes were found worn into holes  When they were asked what they had been doing all night, they always answered that they had been asleep; and, indeed, no noise was ever heard in the room, yet the shoes could not wear themselves out alone! At last the Duke of Beloeil ordered the trumpet to be sounded, and a proclamation to be made that whoever could discover how his daughters wore out their shoes should choose one of them for his wife  On hearing the proclamation a number of princes arrived at the castle to try their luck  They watched all night behind the open door of the princesses, but when the morning came they had all disappeared, and no one could tell what had become of them  When he reached the castle, Michael went straight to the gardener and offered his services  Now it happened that the garden boy had just been sent away, and though the Star Gazer did not look very sturdy, the gardener agreed to take him, as he thought that his pretty face and golden curls would please the princesses  The first thing he was told was that when the princesses got up he was to present each one with a bouquet, and Michael thought that if he had nothing more unpleasant to do than that he should get on very well', " Accordingly he placed himself behind the door of the princesses' room, with the twelve bouquets in a basket", " He gave one to each of the sisters, and they took them without even deigning to look at the lad, except Lina the youngest, who fixed her large black eyes as soft as velvet on him, and exclaimed, 'Oh, how pretty he is--our new flower boy!' The rest all burst out laughing, and the eldest pointed out that a princess ought never to lower herself by looking at a garden boy", ' Now Michael knew quite well what had happened to all the princes, but notwithstanding, the beautiful eyes of the Princess Lina inspired him with a violent longing to try his fate  Unhappily he did not dare to come forward, being afraid that he should only be jeered at, or even turned away from the castle on account of his impudence  There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast, and supported themselves by fishing  They had only one child, a son, who was their pride and joy, and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long, and never felt tired or discontented with their lot', " This son's name was Uraschimataro, which means in Japanese, 'Son of the island,' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman, minding neither wind nor weather", " Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro, and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents, 'If your son goes on being so rash, one day he will try his luck once too often, and the waves will end by swallowing him up", "' But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks, and as he was really very clever in managing a boat, the old people were very seldom anxious about him", ' One beautiful bright morning, as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat, he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle  He was delighted with his prize, and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home, when suddenly the turtle found its voice, and tremblingly begged for its life', " 'After all,' it said, 'what good can I do you? I am so young and small, and I would so gladly live a little longer", ' Be merciful and set me free, and I shall know how to prove my gratitude', "' Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured, and besides, he could never bear to say no, so he picked up the turtle, and put it back into the sea", ' Years flew by, and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea  But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks, there arose a fierce whirlwind, which shattered his boat to pieces, and she was sucked under by the waves  Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate  But he was a powerful swimmer, and struggled hard to reach the shore', " Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him, and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said: 'I am the turtle whose life you once saved", ' I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude  The land is still far distant, and without my help you would never get there  Climb on my back, and I will take you where you will', "' Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice, and thankfully accepted his friend's help", ' But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell, when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once, but go under the sea, and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there  Uraschimataro agreed willingly, and in another moment they were deep, deep down, with fathoms of blue water above their heads  Oh, how quickly they darted through the still, warm sea! The young man held tight, and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel, but for three days they rushed on, till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace, shining with gold and silver, crystal and precious stones, and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls  But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside, he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within, which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales', " 'Where have you brought me?' he asked his guide in a low voice", " 'To the palace of Ringu, the house of the sea god, whose subjects we all are,' answered the turtle", " 'I am the first waiting maid of his daughter, the lovely princess Otohime, whom you will shortly see", "' Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him, that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next", ' But the turtle, who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him, went at once to make known his arrival  And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him, and she begged him to stay with her, and in return promised that he should never grow old, neither should his beauty fade', " 'Is not that reward enough?' she asked, smiling, looking all the while as fair as the sun itself" ,  ' Long, long ago there was born to a Roman knight and his wife Maja a little boy called Virgilius', " While he was still quite little, his father died, and the kinsmen, instead of being a help and protection to the child and his mother, robbed them of their lands and money, and the widow, fearing that they might take the boy's life also, sent him away to Spain, that he might study in the great University of Toledo", ' Virgilius was fond of books, and pored over them all day long  But one afternoon, when the boys were given a holiday, he took a long walk, and found himself in a place where he had never been before  In front of him was a cave, and, as no boy ever sees a cave without entering it, he went in  The cave was so deep that it seemed to Virgilius as if it must run far into the heart of the mountain, and he thought he would like to see if it came out anywhere on the other side', " For some time he walked on in pitch darkness, but he went steadily on, and by-and-by a glimmer of light shot across the floor, and he heard a voice calling, 'Virgilius! Virgilius!' 'Who calls?' he asked, stopping and looking round", " 'Virgilius!' answered the voice, 'do you mark upon the ground where you are standing a slide or bolt?' 'I do,' replied Virgilius", " 'Then,' said the voice, 'draw back that bolt, and set me free", "' 'But who are you?' asked Virgilius, who never did anything in a hurry", " 'I am an evil spirit,' said the voice, 'shut up here till Doomsday, unless a man sets me free", ' If you will let me out I will give you some magic books, which will make you wiser than any other man', "' Now Virgilius loved wisdom, and was tempted by these promises, but again his prudence came to his aid, and he demanded that the books should be handed over to him first, and that he should be told how to use them", ' The evil spirit, unable to help itself, did as Virgilius bade him, and then the bolt was drawn back  Underneath was a small hole, and out of this the evil spirit gradually wriggled himself; but it took some time, for when at last he stood upon the ground he proved to be about three times as large as Virgilius himself, and coal black besides', " 'Why, you can't have been as big as that when you were in the hole!' cried Virgilius", " 'But I was!' replied the spirit", " 'I don't believe it!' answered Virgilius", " 'Well, I'll just get in and show you,' said the spirit, and after turning and twisting, and curling himself up, then he lay neatly packed into the hole", ' Then Virgilius drew the bolt, and, picking the books up under his arm, he left the cave  For the next few weeks Virgilius hardly ate or slept, so busy was he in learning the magic the books contained  But at the end of that time a messenger from his mother arrived in Toledo, begging him to come at once to Rome, as she had been ill, and could look after their affairs no longer  Though sorry to leave Toledo, where he was much thought of as showing promise of great learning, Virgilius would willingly have set out at once, but there were many things he had first to see to  So he entrusted to the messenger four pack-horses laden with precious things, and a white palfrey on which she was to ride out every day  Then he set about his own preparations, and, followed by a large train of scholars, he at length started for Rome, from which he had been absent twelve years  His mother welcomed him back with tears in her eyes, and his poor kinsmen pressed round him, but the rich ones kept away, for they feared that they would no longer be able to rob their kinsman as they had done for many years past  Of course, Virgilius paid no attention to this behaviour, though he noticed they looked with envy on the rich presents he bestowed on the poorer relations and on anyone who had been kind to his mother  Soon after this had happened the season of tax-gathering came round, and everyone who owned land was bound to present himself before the emperor  Like the rest, Virgilius went to court, and demanded justice from the emperor against the men who had robbed him  But as these were kinsmen to the emperor he gained nothing, as the emperor told him he would think over the matter for the next four years, and then give judgment There was once a young man who was studying to be a poet  He wanted to become one by Easter, and to marry, and to live by poetry  To write poems, he knew, only consists in being able to invent something; but he could not invent anything  He had been born too late--everything had been taken up before he came into the world, and everything had been written and told about  "Happy people who were born a thousand years ago!" said he  "It was an easy matter for them to become immortal  Happy even was he who was born a hundred years ago, for then there was still something about which a poem could be written  Now the world is written out, and what can I write poetry about?" Then he studied till he became ill and wretched, the wretched man! No doctor could help him, but perhaps the wise woman could  She lived in the little house by the wayside, where the gate is that she opened for those who rode and drove  But she could do more than unlock the gate  She was wiser than the doctor who drives in his own carriage and pays tax for his rank  "I must go to her," said the young man  The house in which she dwelt was small and neat, but dreary to behold, for there were no flowers near it--no trees  By the door stood a bee-hive, which was very useful', " There was also a little potato-field, very useful, and an earth bank, with sloe bushes upon it, which had done blossoming, and now bore fruit, sloes, that draw one's mouth together if one tastes them before the frost has touched them", ' "That\'s a true picture of our poetryless time, that I see before me now," thought the young man; and that was at least a thought, a grain of gold that he found by the door of the wise woman  "Write that down!" said she  "Even crumbs are bread  I know why you come hither  You cannot invent anything, and yet you want to be a poet by Easter " "Everything has been written down," said he  "Our time is not the old time " "No," said the woman  "In the old time wise women were burnt, and poets went about with empty stomachs, and very much out at elbows  The present time is good, it is the best of times; but you have not the right way of looking at it', " Your ear is not sharpened to hear, and I fancy you do not say the Lord's Prayer in the evening", ' There is plenty here to write poems about, and to tell of, for any one who knows the way  You can read it in the fruits of the earth, you can draw it from the flowing and the standing water; but you must understand how--you must understand how to catch a sunbeam  Now just you try my spectacles on, and put my ear-trumpet to your ear, and then pray to God, and leave off thinking of yourself " The last was a very difficult thing to do--more than a wise woman ought to ask  "When I first went out into the world," said the little mouse, "I fancied, as so many of my age do, that I already knew everything, but it was not so  It takes years to acquire great knowledge  I went at once to sea in a ship bound for the north', " I had been told that the ship's cook must know how to prepare every dish at sea, and it is easy enough to do that with plenty of sides of bacon, and large tubs of salt meat and mouldy flour", ' There I found plenty of delicate food, but no opportunity for learning how to make soup from a sausage skewer  We sailed on for many days and nights; the ship rocked fearfully, and we did not escape without a wetting  As soon as we arrived at the port to which the ship was bound, I left it, and went on shore at a place far towards the north  It is a wonderful thing to leave your own little corner at home, to hide yourself in a ship where there are sure to be some nice snug corners for shelter, then suddenly to find yourself thousands of miles away in a foreign land  I saw large pathless forests of pine and birch trees, which smelt so strong that I sneezed and thought of sausage  There were great lakes also which looked as black as ink at a distance, but were quite clear when I came close to them  Large swans were floating upon them, and I thought at first they were only foam, they lay so still; but when I saw them walk and fly, I knew what they were directly  They belong to the goose species, one can see that by their walk  No one can attempt to disguise family descent  I kept with my own kind, and associated with the forest and field mice, who, however, knew very little, especially about what I wanted to know, and which had actually made me travel abroad  The idea that soup could be made from a sausage skewer was to them such an out-of-the-way, unlikely thought, that it was repeated from one to another through the whole forest  They declared that the problem would never be solved, that the thing was an impossibility  How little I thought that in this place, on the very first night, I should be initiated into the manner of its preparation  "It was the height of summer, which the mice told me was the reason that the forest smelt so strong, and that the herbs were so fragrant, and the lakes with the white swimming swans so dark, and yet so clear  On the margin of the wood, near to three or four houses, a pole, as large as the mainmast of a ship, had been erected, and from the summit hung wreaths of flowers and fluttering ribbons; it was the Maypole  Lads and lasses danced round the pole, and tried to outdo the violins of the musicians with their singing  They were as merry as ever at sunset and in the moonlight, but I took no part in the merry-making  What has a little mouse to do with a Maypole dance? I sat in the soft moss, and held my sausage skewer tight  The moon threw its beams particularly on one spot where stood a tree covered with exceedingly fine moss  I may almost venture to say that it was as fine and soft as the fur of the mouse-king, but it was green, which is a color very agreeable to the eye  All at once I saw the most charming little people marching towards me  They did not reach higher than my knee; they looked like human beings, but were better proportioned, and they called themselves elves  Their clothes were very delicate and fine, for they were made of the leaves of flowers, trimmed with the wings of flies and gnats, which had not a bad effect  By their manner, it appeared as if they were seeking for something', " I knew not what, till at last one of them espied me and came towards me, and the foremost pointed to my sausage skewer, and said, 'There, that is just what we want; see, it is pointed at the top; is it not capital?' and the longer he looked at my pilgrim's staff, the more delighted he became", " 'I will lend it to you,' said I, 'but not to keep" ,  ' "I started off at once to the largest town," said she, "but the name of it has escaped me  I have a very bad memory for names  I was carried from the railway, with some forfeited goods, to the jail, and on arriving I made my escape, and ran into the house of the turnkey  The turnkey was speaking of his prisoners, especially of one who had uttered thoughtless words', " These words had given rise to other words, and at length they were written down and registered: 'The whole affair is like making soup of sausage skewers,' said he, 'but the soup may cost him his neck", '\' "Now this raised in me an interest for the prisoner," continued the little mouse, "and I watched my opportunity, and slipped into his apartment, for there is a mouse-hole to be found behind every closed door  The prisoner looked pale; he had a great beard and large, sparkling eyes  There was a lamp burning, but the walls were so black that they only looked the blacker for it  The prisoner scratched pictures and verses with white chalk on the black walls, but I did not read the verses  I think he found his confinement wearisome, so that I was a welcome guest  He enticed me with bread-crumbs, with whistling, and with gentle words, and seemed so friendly towards me, that by degrees I gained confidence in him, and we became friends; he divided his bread and water with me, gave me cheese and sausage, and I really began to love him  Altogether, I must own that it was a very pleasant intimacy  He let me run about on his hand, and on his arm, and into his sleeve; and I even crept into his beard, and he called me his little friend  I forgot what I had come out into the world for; forgot my sausage skewer which I had laid in a crack in the floor--it is lying there still  I wished to stay with him always where I was, for I knew that if I went away the poor prisoner would have no one to be his friend, which is a sad thing  I stayed, but he did not  He spoke to me so mournfully for the last time, gave me double as much bread and cheese as usual, and kissed his hand to me  Then he went away, and never came back  I know nothing more of his history  "The jailer took possession of me now  He said something about soup from a sausage skewer, but I could not trust him  He took me in his hand certainly, but it was to place me in a cage like a tread-mill  Oh how dreadful it was! I had to run round and round without getting any farther in advance, and only to make everybody laugh', " The jailer's grand-daughter was a charming little thing", ' She had curly hair like the brightest gold, merry eyes, and such a smiling mouth  "\'You poor little mouse,\' said she, one day as she peeped into my cage, \'I will set you free', "' She then drew forth the iron fastening, and I sprang out on the window-sill, and from thence to the roof", ' Free! free! that was all I could think of; not of the object of my journey  It grew dark, and as night was coming on I found a lodging in an old tower, where dwelt a watchman and an owl  I had no confidence in either of them, least of all in the owl, which is like a cat, and has a great failing, for she eats mice INTRODUCTION It is a strange thing, when I feel most fervently and most deeply, my hands and my tongue seem alike tied, so that I cannot rightly describe or accurately portray the thoughts that are rising within me; and yet I am a painter; my eye tells me as much as that, and all my friends who have seen my sketches and fancies say the same  I am a poor lad, and live in one of the narrowest of lanes; but I do not want for light, as my room is high up in the house, with an extensive prospect over the neighbouring roofs  During the first few days I went to live in the town, I felt low-spirited and solitary enough  Instead of the forest and the green hills of former days, I had here only a forest of chimney-pots to look out upon  And then I had not a single friend; not one familiar face greeted me  So one evening I sat at the window, in a desponding mood; and presently I opened the casement and looked out  Oh, how my heart leaped up with joy! Here was a well-known face at last--a round, friendly countenance, the face of a good friend I had known at home  In, fact, it was the MOON that looked in upon me  He was quite unchanged, the dear old Moon, and had the same face exactly that he used to show when he peered down upon me through the willow trees on the moor  I kissed my hand to him over and over again, as he shone far into my little room; and he, for his part, promised me that every evening, when he came abroad, he would look in upon me for a few moments  This promise he has faithfully kept  It is a pity that he can only stay such a short time when he comes  Whenever he appears, he tells me of one thing or another that he has seen on the previous night, or on that same evening  "Just paint the scenes I describe to you"--this is what he said to me--"and you will have a very pretty picture-book " I have followed his injunction for many evenings  I could make up a new "Thousand and One Nights," in my own way, out of these pictures, but the number might be too great, after all  The pictures I have here given have not been chosen at random, but follow in their proper order, just as they were described to me  Some great gifted painter, or some poet or musician, may make something more of them if he likes; what I have given here are only hasty sketches, hurriedly put upon the paper, with some of my own thoughts, interspersed; for the Moon did not come to me every evening--a cloud sometimes hid his face from me  FIRST EVENING "Last night"--I am quoting the Moon\'s own words--"last night I was gliding through the cloudless Indian sky', " My face was mirrored in the waters of the Ganges, and my beams strove to pierce through the thick intertwining boughs of the bananas, arching beneath me like the tortoise's shell", ' Forth from the thicket tripped a Hindoo maid, light as a gazelle, beautiful as Eve  Airy and etherial as a vision, and yet sharply defined amid the surrounding shadows, stood this daughter of Hindostan: I could read on her delicate brow the thought that had brought her hither  The thorny creeping plants tore her sandals, but for all that she came rapidly forward  The deer that had come down to the river to quench her thirst, sprang by with a startled bound, for in her hand the maiden bore a lighted lamp  I could see the blood in her delicate finger tips, as she spread them for a screen before the dancing flame  She came down to the stream, and set the lamp upon the water, and let it float away', " The flame flickered to and fro, and seemed ready to expire; but still the lamp burned on, and the girl's black sparkling eyes, half veiled behind their long silken lashes, followed it with a gaze of earnest intensity", ' She knew that if the lamp continued to burn so long as she could keep it in sight, her betrothed was still alive; but if the lamp was suddenly extinguished, he was dead  And the lamp burned bravely on, and she fell on her knees, and prayed  Near her in the grass lay a speckled snake, but she heeded it not--she thought only of Bramah and of her betrothed  I will tell you a story that was told me when I was a little boy  Every time I thought of this story, it seemed to me more and more charming; for it is with stories as it is with many people--they become better as they grow older  I have no doubt that you have been in the country, and seen a very old farmhouse, with a thatched roof, and mosses and small plants growing wild upon it', " There is a stork's nest on the ridge of the gable, for we cannot do without the stork", ' The walls of the house are sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of the latter is made to open  The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a great knob  An elder-tree hangs over the palings; and beneath its branches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of water, in which a few ducks are disporting themselves  There is a yard-dog too, who barks at all corners  Just such a farmhouse as this stood in a country lane; and in it dwelt an old couple, a peasant and his wife  Small as their possessions were, they had one article they could not do without, and that was a horse, which contrived to live upon the grass which it found by the side of the high road  The old peasant rode into the town upon this horse, and his neighbors often borrowed it of him, and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service to the old couple  After a time they thought it would be as well to sell the horse, or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them  But what might this something be? "You\'ll know best, old man," said the wife  "It is fair-day to-day; so ride into town, and get rid of the horse for money, or make a good exchange; whichever you do will be right to me, so ride to the fair " And she fastened his neckerchief for him; for she could do that better than he could, and she could also tie it very prettily in a double bow  She also smoothed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand, and gave him a kiss  Then he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold or bartered for something else  Yes, the old man knew what he was about  The sun shone with great heat, and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky  The road was very dusty; for a number of people, all going to the fair, were driving, riding, or walking upon it  There was no shelter anywhere from the hot sunshine  Among the rest a man came trudging along, and driving a cow to the fair  The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could be  "She gives good milk, I am certain," said the peasant to himself  "That would be a very good exchange: the cow for the horse  Hallo there! you with the cow," he said  "I tell you what; I dare say a horse is of more value than a cow; but I don\'t care for that,--a cow will be more useful to me; so, if you like, we\'ll exchange " "To be sure I will," said the man  Accordingly the exchange was made; and as the matter was settled, the peasant might have turned back; for he had done the business he came to do  But, having made up his mind to go to the fair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it; so on he went to the town with his cow  Once upon a time a great king of the East, named Saman-lalposh, had three brave and clever sons--Tahmasp, Qamas, and Almas-ruh-baksh', " One day, when the king was sitting in his hall of audience, his eldest son, Prince Tahmasp, came before him, and after greeting his father with due respect, said: 'O my royal father! I am tired of the town; if you will give me leave, I will take my servants to-morrow and will go into the country and hunt on the hill-skirts; and when I have taken some game I will come back, at evening-prayer time", "' His father consented, and sent with him some of his own trusted servants, and also hawks, and falcons, hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards", ' At the place where the prince intended to hunt he saw a most beautiful deer  He ordered that it should not be killed, but trapped or captured with a noose  The deer looked about for a place where he might escape from the ring of the beaters, and spied one unwatched close to the prince himself  It bounded high and leaped right over his head, got out of the ring, and tore like the eastern wind into the waste  The prince put spurs to his horse and pursued it; and was soon lost to the sight of his followers  Until the world-lighting sun stood above his head in the zenith he did not take his eyes off the deer; suddenly it disappeared behind some rising ground, and with all his search he could not find any further trace of it', " He was now drenched in sweat, and he breathed with pain; and his horse's tongue hung from its mouth with thirst", ' He dismounted and toiled on, with bridle on arm, praying and casting himself on the mercy of heaven  Then his horse fell and surrendered its life to God  On and on he went across the sandy waste, weeping and with burning breast, till at length a hill rose into sight  He mustered his strength and climbed to the top, and there he found a giant tree whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth, and whose crest touched the very heaven  Its branches had put forth a glory of leaves, and there were grass and a spring underneath it, and flowers of many colours', " Gladdened by this sight, he dragged himself to the water's edge, drank his fill, and returned thanks for his deliverance from thirst", ' He looked about him and, to his amazement, saw close by a royal seat  While he was pondering what could have brought this into the merciless desert, a man drew near who was dressed like a faqir, and had bare head and feet, but walked with the free carriage of a person of rank  His face was kind, and wise and thoughtful, and he came on and spoke to the prince', " 'O good youth! how did you come here? Who are you? Where do you come from?' The prince told everything just as it had happened to him, and then respectfully added: 'I have made known my own circumstances to you, and now I venture to beg you to tell me your own", " Who are you? How did you come to make your dwelling in this wilderness?' To this the faqir replied: 'O youth! it would be best for you to have nothing to do with me and to know nothing of my fortunes, for my story is fit neither for telling nor for hearing", "' The prince, however, pleaded so hard to be told, that at last there was nothing to be done but to let him hear", " 'Learn and know, O young man! that I am King Janangir of Babylon, and that once I had army and servants, family and treasure; untold wealth and belongings", ' The Most High God gave me seven sons who grew up well versed in all princely arts  My eldest son heard from travellers that in Turkistan, on the Chinese frontier, there is a king named Quimus, the son of Timus, and that he has an only child, a daughter named Mihr-afruz, who, under all the azure heaven, is unrivalled for beauty  Princes come from all quarters to ask her hand, and on one and all she imposes a condition  She says to them: "I know a riddle; and I will marry anyone who answers it, and will bestow on him all my possessions  But if a suitor cannot answer my question I cut off his head and hang it on the battlements of the citadel " The riddle she asks is, "What did the rose do to the cypress?" \'Now, when my son heard this tale, he fell in love with that unseen girl, and he came to me lamenting and bewailing himself  Nothing that I could say had the slightest effect on him  "I was born in the library, at a castle," said the second mouse  "Very few members of our family ever had the good fortune to get into the dining-room, much less the store-room  On my journey, and here to-day, are the only times I have ever seen a kitchen  We were often obliged to suffer hunger in the library, but then we gained a great deal of knowledge  The rumor reached us of the royal prize offered to those who should be able to make soup from a sausage skewer', " Then my old grandmother sought out a manuscript which, however, she could not read, but had heard it read, and in it was written, 'Those who are poets can make soup of sausage skewers", "' She then asked me if I was a poet", ' I felt myself quite innocent of any such pretensions  Then she said I must go out and make myself a poet  I asked again what I should be required to do, for it seemed to me quite as difficult as to find out how to make soup of a sausage skewer  My grandmother had heard a great deal of reading in her day, and she told me three principal qualifications were necessary--understanding, imagination, and feeling', " 'If you can manage to acquire these three, you will be a poet, and the sausage-skewer soup will be quite easy to you", '\' "So I went forth into the world, and turned my steps towards the west, that I might become a poet  Understanding is the most important matter in everything  I knew that, for the two other qualifications are not thought much of; so I went first to seek for understanding', " Where was I to find it? 'Go to the ant and learn wisdom,' said the great Jewish king", ' I knew that from living in a library  So I went straight on till I came to the first great ant-hill, and then I set myself to watch, that I might become wise  The ants are a very respectable people, they are wisdom itself  All they do is like the working of a sum in arithmetic, which comes right', " 'To work and to lay eggs,' say they, and to provide for posterity, is to live out your time properly;' and that they truly do", ' They are divided into the clean and the dirty ants, their rank is pointed out by a number, and the ant-queen is number ONE; and her opinion is the only correct one on everything; she seems to have the whole wisdom of the world in her, which was just the important matter I wished to acquire  She said a great deal which was no doubt very clever; yet to me it sounded like nonsense  She said the ant-hill was the loftiest thing in the world, and yet close to the mound stood a tall tree, which no one could deny was loftier, much loftier, but no mention was made of the tree  One evening an ant lost herself on this tree; she had crept up the stem, not nearly to the top, but higher than any ant had ever ventured; and when at last she returned home she said that she had found something in her travels much higher than the ant-hill  The rest of the ants considered this an insult to the whole community; so she was condemned to wear a muzzle and to live in perpetual solitude  A short time afterwards another ant got on the tree, and made the same journey and the same discovery, but she spoke of it cautiously and indefinitely, and as she was one of the superior ants and very much respected, they believed her, and when she died they erected an eggshell as a monument to her memory, for they cultivated a great respect for science  I saw," said the little mouse, "that the ants were always running to and fro with her burdens on their backs  Once I saw one of them drop her load; she gave herself a great deal of trouble in trying to raise it again, but she could not succeed  Then two others came up and tried with all their strength to help her, till they nearly dropped their own burdens in doing so; then they were obliged to stop for a moment in their help, for every one must think of himself first  The walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors of cutting winds  There were more than a hundred halls there, according as the snow was driven by the winds  The largest was many miles in extent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all were so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never reigned there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm for music, while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off their steps  Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast, cold, and empty were the halls of the Snow Queen  The northern-lights shone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were at their highest or lowest degree of brightness  In the middle of the empty, endless hall of snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a thousand pieces, but each piece was so like the other, that it seemed the work of a cunning artificer  In the middle of this lake sat the Snow Queen when she was at home; and then she said she was sitting in the Mirror of Understanding, and that this was the only one and the best thing in the world  Little Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did not observe it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body, and his heart was a lump of ice  He was dragging along some pointed flat pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways, for he wanted to make something with them; just as we have little flat pieces of wood to make geometrical figures with, called the Chinese Puzzle  Kay made all sorts of figures, the most complicated, for it was an ice-puzzle for the understanding  In his eyes the figures were extraordinarily beautiful, and of the utmost importance; for the bit of glass which was in his eye caused this  He found whole figures which represented a written word; but he never could manage to represent just the word he wanted--that word was "eternity"; and the Snow Queen had said, "If you can discover that figure, you shall be your own master, and I will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new skates " But he could not find it out  "I am going now to warm lands," said the Snow Queen  "I must have a look down into the black caldrons " It was the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna that she meant  "I will just give them a coating of white, for that is as it ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes " And then away she flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of ice that were miles long, and looked at the blocks of ice, and thought and thought till his skull was almost cracked  There he sat quite benumbed and motionless; one would have imagined he was frozen to death  Suddenly little Gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace  The gate was formed of cutting winds; but Gerda repeated her evening prayer, and the winds were laid as though they slept; and the little maiden entered the vast, empty, cold halls  There she beheld Kay: she recognised him, flew to embrace him, and cried out, her arms firmly holding him the while, "Kay, sweet little Kay! Have I then found you at last?" But he sat quite still, benumbed and cold  Then little Gerda shed burning tears; and they fell on his bosom, they penetrated to his heart, they thawed the lumps of ice, and consumed the splinters of the looking-glass; he looked at her, and she sang the hymn: "The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there the children to greet " Hereupon Kay burst into tears; he wept so much that the splinter rolled out of his eye, and he recognised her, and shouted, "Gerda, sweet little Gerda! Where have you been so long? And where have I been?" He looked round him  "How cold it is here!" said he  "How empty and cold!" And he held fast by Gerda, who laughed and wept for joy  It was so beautiful, that even the blocks of ice danced about for joy; and when they were tired and laid themselves down, they formed exactly the letters which the Snow Queen had told him to find out; so now he was his own master, and he would have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the bargain  Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they grew quite blooming; she kissed his eyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and he was again well and merry  The Snow Queen might come back as soon as she liked; there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice  They took each other by the hand, and wandered forth out of the large hall; they talked of their old grandmother, and of the roses upon the roof; and wherever they went, the winds ceased raging, and the sun burst forth  In a little village that stood on a wide plain, where you could see the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set, there lived two couples side by side  The men, who worked under the same master, were quite good friends, but the wives were always quarrelling, and the subject they quarrelled most about was--which of the two had the stupidest husband  Unlike most women--who think that anything that belongs to them must be better than what belongs to anyone else--each thought her husband the more foolish of the two', " 'You should just see what he does!' one said to her neighbour", " 'He puts on the baby's frock upside down, and, one day, I found him trying to feed her with boiling soup, and her mouth was scalded for days after", ' Then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes, and one day he wanted to go into the garden from the top window, because he declared it was a shorter way than through the door', "' 'That is bad enough, of course,' answered the other; 'but it is really NOTHING to what I have to endure every day from MY husband", ' If, when I am busy, I ask him to go and feed the poultry, he is certain to give them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food, and when I visit the yard next I find them all dead  Once he even took my best bonnet, when I had gone away to my sick mother, and when I came back I found he had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in  And you know yourself that, only last week, when I sent him to buy a cask of butter, he returned driving a hundred and fifty ducks which someone had induced him to take, and not one of them would lay', "' 'Yes, I am afraid he IS trying,' replied the first; 'but let us put them to the proof, and see which of them is the most foolish", "' So, about the time that she expected her husband home from work, she got out her spinning-wheel, and sat busily turning it, taking care not even to look up from her work when the man came in", " For some minutes he stood with his mouth open watching her, and as she still remained silent, he said at last: 'Have you gone mad, wife, that you sit spinning without anything on the wheel?' 'YOU may think that there is nothing on it,' answered she, 'but I can assure you that there is a large skein of wool, so fine that nobody can see it, which will be woven into a coat for you", "' 'Dear me!' he replied, 'what a clever wife I have got! If you had not told me I should never have known that there was any wool on the wheel at all", ' But now I really do seem to see something', "' The woman smiled and was silent, and after spinning busily for an hour more, she got up from her stoop, and began to weave as fast as she could", " At last she got up, and said to her husband: 'I am too tired to finish it to-night, so I shall go to bed, and to-morrow I shall only have the cutting and stitching to do", "' So the next morning she got up early, and after she had cleaned her house, and fed her chickens, and put everything in its place again, she bent over the kitchen table, and the sound of her big scissors might be heard snip! snap! as far as the garden", ' Her husband could not see anything to snip at; but then he was so stupid that was not surprising! After the cutting came the sewing', " The woman patted and pinned and fixed and joined, and then, turning to the man, she said: 'Now it is ready for you to try on", "' And she made him take off his coat, and stand up in front of her, and once more she patted an pinned and fixed and joined, and was very careful in smoothing out every wrinkle", " 'It does not feel very warm,' observed the man at last, when he had borne all this patiently for a long time", " 'That is because it is so fine,' answered she; 'you do not want it to be as thick as the rough clothes you wear every day", "' He DID, but was ashamed to say so, and only answered: 'Well, I am sure it must be beautiful since you say so, and I shall be smarter than anyone in the whole village", ' "What a splendid coat!" they will exclaim when they see me  But it is not everybody who has a wife as clever as mine', "' Meanwhile the other wife was not idle", ' As soon as her husband entered she looked at him with such a look of terror that the poor man was quite frightened', " 'Why do you stare at me so? Is there anything the matter?' asked he", " 'Oh! go to bed at once,' she cried; 'you must be very ill indeed to look like that!' The man was rather surprised at first, as he felt particularly well that evening; but the moment his wife spoke he became quite certain that he had something dreadful the matter with him, and grew quite pale" ,  " Once upon a time a horse's skull lay on the open plain", ' It had been picked clean by the ants, and shone white in the sunlight  Little Burrowing Mouse came along, twirling his whiskers and looking at the world  He saw the white skull, and thought it was as good as a palace  He stood up in front of it and called out,-- "Little house, little house! Who lives in the little house?" No one answered, for there was no one inside  "I will live there myself," says little Burrowing Mouse, and in he went, and set up house in the horse\'s skull  Croaking Frog came along, a jump, three long strides, and a jump again  "Little house, little house! Who lives in the little house?" "I am Burrowing Mouse; who are you?" "I am Croaking Frog " "Come in and make yourself at home " So the frog went in, and they began to live, the two of them together  Hare Hide-in-the-Hill came running by  "Little house, little house! Who lives in the little house?" "Burrowing Mouse and Croaking Frog  Who are you?" "I am Hare Hide-in-the-Hill " "Come along in " So the hare put his ears down and went in, and they began to live, the three of them together  Then the fox came running by  "Little house, little house! Who lives in the little house?" "Burrowing Mouse and Croaking Frog and Hare Hide-in-the-Hill  Who are you?" "I am Fox Run-about-Everywhere " "Come along in; we\'ve room for you " So the fox went in, and they began to live, the four of them together  Then the wolf came prowling by, and saw the skull  "Little house, little house! Who lives in the little house?" "Burrowing Mouse, and Croaking Frog, and Hare Hide-in-the-Hill, and Fox Run-about-Every-where  Who are you?" "I am Wolf Leap-out-of-the-Bushes " "Come in then " So the wolf went in, and they began to live, the five of them together  And then there came along the Bear  He was very slow and very heavy  "Little house, little house! Who lives in the little house?" "Burrowing Mouse, and Croaking Frog, and Hare Hide-in-the-Hill, and Fox Run-about-Every-where, and Wolf Leap-out-of-the-Bushes  Who are you?" "I am Bear Squash-the-Lot " And the Bear sat down on the horse\'s skull, and squashed the whole lot of them  As a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish, the queen appeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and show what she had  At that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom of the basket  "Is it a he or a she?" inquired the queen  "I wish to purchase a she fish " On hearing this the fish laughed aloud  "It\'s a he," replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds  The queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to see her in the evening, the king noticed that something had disturbed her  "Are you indisposed?" he said  "No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behaviour of a fish  A woman brought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a male or female, the fish laughed most rudely " "A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming " "I am not a fool  I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes and have heard with my own ears " "Passing strange! Be it so  I will inquire concerning it " On the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had told him, and bade him investigate the matter, and be ready with a satisfactory answer within six months, on pain of death  The vizier promised to do his best, though he felt almost certain of failure  For five months he laboured indefatigably to find a reason for the laughter of the fish  He sought everywhere and from every one  The wise and learned, and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner of trickery, were consulted  Nobody, however, could explain the matter; and so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began to arrange his affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had sufficient experience of the king to know that His Majesty would not go back from his threat', " Amongst other things, he advised his son to travel for a time, until the king's anger should have somewhat cooled", ' The young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started off whithersoever Kismat might lead him  He had been gone some days, when he fell in with an old farmer, who also was on a journey to a certain village  Finding the old man very pleasant, he asked him if he might accompany him, professing to be on a visit to the same place  The old farmer agreed, and they walked along together  The day was hot, and the way was long and weary  "Don\'t you think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave one another a lift?" said the youth  "What a fool the man is!" thought the old farmer  Presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle, and looking like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze  There was once a little princess whose father was king over a great country full of mountains and valleys  His palace was built upon one of the mountains, and was very grand and beautiful  The princess, whose name was Irene, was born there, but she was sent soon after her birth, because her mother was not very strong, to be brought up by country people in a large house, half castle, half farmhouse, on the side of another mountain, about half-way between its base and its peak  The princess was a sweet little creature, and at the time my story begins was about eight years old, I think, but she got older very fast  Her face was fair and pretty, with eyes like two bits of night sky, each with a star dissolved in the blue  Those eyes you would have thought must have known they came from there, so often were they turned up in that direction  The ceiling of her nursery was blue, with stars in it, as like the sky as they could make it  But I doubt if ever she saw the real sky with the stars in it, for a reason which I had better mention at once  These mountains were full of hollow places underneath; huge caverns, and winding ways, some with water running through them, and some shining with all colours of the rainbow when a light was taken in  There would not have been much known about them, had there not been mines there, great deep pits, with long galleries and passages running off from them, which had been dug to get at the ore of which the mountains were full  In the course of digging, the miners came upon many of these natural caverns  A few of them had far-off openings out on the side of a mountain, or into a ravine  Now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings, called by some gnomes, by some kobolds, by some goblins  There was a legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground, and were very like other people  But for some reason or other, concerning which there were different legendary theories, the king had laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them, or had required observances of them they did not like, or had begun to treat them with more severity, in some way or other, and impose stricter laws; and the consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the country  According to the legend, however, instead of going to some other country, they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns, whence they never came out but at night, and then seldom showed themselves in any numbers, and never to many people at once  It was only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains that they were said to gather even at night in the open air  Those who had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in the course of generations; and no wonder, seeing they lived away from the sun, in cold and wet and dark places  They were now, not ordinarily ugly, but either absolutely hideous, or ludicrously grotesque both in face and form  There was no invention, they said, of the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil, that could surpass the extravagance of their appearance  But I suspect those who said so had mistaken some of their animal companions for the goblins themselves--of which more by and by  The goblins themselves were not so far removed from the human as such a description would imply  And as they grew misshapen in body they had grown in knowledge and cleverness, and now were able to do things no mortal could see the possibility of  But as they grew in cunning, they grew in mischief, and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy the people who lived in the open-air storey above them', " They had enough of affection left for each other to preserve them from being absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way; but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those who occupied their former possessions and especially against the descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion, that they sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as their inventors; and although dwarfed and misshapen, they had strength equal to their cunning", ' In the process of time they had got a king and a government of their own, whose chief business, beyond their own simple affairs, was to devise trouble for their neighbours  It will now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at night  They were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the house then, even in company with ever so many attendants; and they had good reason, as we shall see by and by     One day a peasant took his good hazel-stick out of the corner and said to his wife, trina, I am going across country, and shall not return for three days  If during that time the cattle-dealer should happen to call and want to buy our three cows, you may strike a bargain at once, but not unless you can get two hundred talers for them, nothing less, do you hear', " For heaven's sake, just go in peace, answered the woman, I will manage that", ' You, indeed, said the man  You once fell on your head when you were a little child, and that affects you even now, but let me tell you this, if you do anything foolish, I will make your back black and blue, and not with paint, I assure you, but with the stick which I have in my hand, and the coloring shall last a whole year, you may rely on that  And having said that, the man went on his way  Next morning the cattle-dealer came, and the woman had no need to say many words to him  When he had seen the cows and heard the price, he said, I am quite willing to give that  Honestly speaking, they are worth it  I will take the beasts away with me at once  He unfastened their chains and drove them out of the byre, but just as he was going out of the yard-door, the woman clutched him by the sleeve and said, you must give me the two hundred talers now, or I cannot let the cows go  True, answered the man, but I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt  Have no fear, however, you shall have security for my paying  I will take two cows with me and leave one, and then you will have a good pledge  The woman saw the force of this, and let the man go away with the cows, and thought to herself, how pleased Hans will be when he finds how cleverly I have managed it  The peasant came home on the third day as he had said he would, and at once inquired if the cows were sold  Yes, indeed, dear Hans, answered the woman, and as you said, for two hundred talers  They are scarcely worth so much, but the man took them without making any objection  Where is the money, asked the peasant  Oh, I have not got the money, replied the woman, he had happened to forget his money-belt, but he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him  What kind of security, asked the man  One of the three cows, which he shall not have until he has paid for the other two  I have managed very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats the least', " The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was just going to give her the beating he had promised her, when suddenly he let the stick fail and said, you are the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God's earth, but I am sorry for you", ' I will go out into the highways and wait for three days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you  If I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not find him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any discount  He went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and waited for what would happen', " Then he saw a peasant's waggon coming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the middle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which was lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them", ' The man thought to himself, that is certainly one of the kind I am in search of, and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not in his right mind  What do you want, my friend, said the woman to him'
